European inflation has slipped on food
Accelerated inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The November price hike in the eurozone 13 countries was higher than expected, with inflation of 3.1 per cent per year after 2.6 per cent in October, the EU’s Luxembourg Statistical Office reported.
The official forecast was only 3% more likely, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian banknotes, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the basic rate, saying that the decline would lead to an inflationary spiral along with rising commodity prices and declining unemployment.
The ECB is less than 2%, but it wants to keep its inflation rate close to that.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the twenty-two trap: “We need to talk about” inflation so that it doesn’t have to act on this issue later.
In Germany, the November inflation rate is 3.3 per cent, a record twelve years, and in Spain, it has risen from 4.1 to 3.6.
Inflation in the euro area has been boosted by rising food and energy prices.
Wheat notes have increased by 88 per cent, and the exchange rate of soybean has reached the highest since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also had to be paid significantly more in 2007.
Global oil prices have risen by 52 percent this year, and a barrel of black gold has already cost almost <0x24>100 in the past month.
According to the ECB, inflation is rising from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent this year in 2008, but is already falling to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3 percent over the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to have doubled interest rates in 2008.
Gallup is facing a government crisis
Fidesz’s supporters have grown significantly since the beginning of December following a long stagnation, so it has now had the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has not yet measured such a low, 13 percent Socialist support.
The difference between the party's commissioners - due to the greater willingness of the opposition voters - would mean more than two-thirds (71%) of the support against the support of the MSZP by one-fifth (20%).
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the entire population is 2%.
Among the voters of the Commissioner there are a percentage of supporters of both camps.
The economic mood has further deteriorated to the bottom of the previous one - it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who considered the economic situation in the country specifically very bad, while the other 46 percent say the situation is quite bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about the change in their own financial situation after the more hopeful spring and summer outlooks.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, Gallup surveyed more people, 71 percent of respondents thought the prime minister was doing his job worse than he was doing well.
In France, 13 per cent of the respondents trust or very trust, while in Orbán Viktor, 38 per cent of the supporters.
Fidesz is the president of Fidesz, with 54 percent not trusting him at all.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of society thinks it is possible to deal with dissatisfaction with the prime ministers without a change of government.
While 35 per cent considered the government and the head of government to remain desirable after the riots in October last year, at present this rate is only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) only see the solution in the drafting of new elections.
The interest in a referendum is characterised by the fact that 60 percent of respondents responding to a question that drives their intentions to participate would certainly leave, and an additional 20 percent said they would likely leave.
In comparison, only 55 per cent would be sure to participate in a "Sunday's National Assembly Election" and an additional 15 per cent would consider it likely to participate. The result of the referendum would not be questionable on the basis of current intentions.
74 people will say no to tuition fees, 79 to visit fees, and 84 percent to hospital daily fees.
If we only looked at the same percentages of their participation in the referendum among promising commissioners, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, visit fees and hospital daily fees.
The most expensive of the Auchan, Tesco raised by almost a fifth
In the Buda trade triangle, hypermarkets saw an average price increase of 16 percent last year, with the difference being that this year there was no increase in VAT.
Article of the Daily Economy
This year, Buda’s trade grew an average of 16 percent in the usual daily Christmas basket triangle, but in each hypermarket there was a growth of more than a thousand forints in value.
Since last December the prices in grocery stores had already "launched", there was no drastic price increase as compared to the previous high base.
But it is obviously awful for consumers to see that what they had received under <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 last year is now not even worth 10,000.
The Daily Basket crossed the spiritual limit of ten thousand forints with at least 91 forints in the hypermarkets studied.
The highest basket value was <0xC2><0xA3>10,573.
(In 2003, the cart was worth 6800 forints.)
The price of Unicum and live fish almost remained at last year’s level, but it was very expensive for turkey fillets, dio and mak.
KSH's data followed the price of flour and bread in the stores, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition did not print the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of the two-liter recycled bottle of Coca-Cola was under 200 forints, so along with the deposit fee, only 257 forints were requested for the product.
However, this year the Auchan appeared in the Daily Basket as the most expensive, while the Cora was the cheapest.
We estimate that the Cora 15 and Tesco and Auchan increased the prices in the Daily Basket by around 18-18% compared to last year’s Christmas prices.
The difference between last year’s most expensive and last year’s cheapest basket value was 12 percent, while last year’s cheapest and last year’s most expensive one was 21 percent.
In Forint, the average increase was 1480.
Last year the average price increase came to 1206 forin, so that last Christmas it felt the effect of the tax increase on prices.
It was this process that divided trade, apparently the stores were unable to decide how much price they applied to each product, and they were unable to calculate the impact of the price change on consumption.
(If a product’s rotational speed is badly planned by the trader, then it’s a serious benefit to bukhat at a price adjusted to traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT last year, the price increase in the Daily basket was so extreme that the most expensive was 1,720 forints above the 2006 value, while the cheapest was just 844 forints.
This extreme did not show up this year, as the current most expensive was 1,630 forints more than last year, and the cheapest one was 1,284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic increase in the price of daily items in hypermarkets in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily support the KSH data: the Statistical Office has seen a more than 30 percent shadow growth in some basic foods over a 12-month period.
In addition to the eggs, for example.)
According to the Daily Basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, as the price level of a rather expensive product already last year produced a shadow increase of just over 10 percent compared to the base in the worst case.
List suppliers are reportedly in a stronger position than egg yolks, and they have managed to counteract the drastic price increase in the multikon.
In the trading gold triangle, the hypers do not complain, they report on a good year continuously.
According to our experience, the three shops visited are no longer interested in the weight of the customers.
They buy a lot of everything, they take the lasting food with them.
In the morning of Wednesday, the three stores developed serious lines in front of the wallets, as the number of visitors suddenly increased.
But we know that there is more traffic in rural areas, more multi complaints to research firms that even their revenue plans are missing, not only for food, but also for durable consumer items.
Save on disinfectants in many places
More than 1,000 infections have been reported in hospitals this year, mainly due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff do not favor the cessation of infections, says the head doctor of the National Center for Epidemiology.
They also save on disinfectants in many places.
MRSA infection was recently diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
In a man who was admitted after a serious accident, a bacteria that was resistant to antibiotics was detected.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the beginning of the year.
He was discharged from the hospital after a serious car accident, but soon afterwards he had to return with MRSA infection, and since then he has not been able to perform an important surgery because of the bacteria in his body.
By 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Böröcz Karolina, the head of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, the rest of them are unknown.
About two-thirds (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by one-third of people without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g., throat inflammation, almond inflammation, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics, can be well cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics develops a bacteria that is highly resistant to antibiotics, which spreads rapidly under inappropriate hospital conditions.
Primarily, when the immune system is temporarily or permanently malfunctioning, it can cause serious hospital infections in patients with weaker organisms, old or low body weight, such as wound infection or blood poisoning - septicemia.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only not there, said Nyulasi Tibor, where the presence of the pathogen is not being investigated.
Resistance to antibiotics
“We are isolating such patients, nursing staff in rubber gloves and masks, and they have the right antibiotics for their treatment,” said Nylasi Tibor.
Patients who are admitted to the hospital are examined to see if MRSA is present in their body, but this does not always prevent infection.
It's not fashion sampling
The overwhelming majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not favorable to prevent the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Bör<0xC3><0xB8>cz Karolina.
After this infection typically occurs in hospitals, in elderly hospitals, hospitals should check the patients who enter, and patients who carry MRSA should be separated immediately.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not in fashion.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these examinations.
In most cases, this is the case when the patient has a detectable MRSA infection, said the chief medical officer of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out in order not to develop resistance to drugs, but hospitals do not always do so.
Microbiological sampling is even less common in road patients and basic care, said Böröcz Karolina.
Save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence confirms that MRSA is most often spread from one patient to another through the mediation of health care staff.
Therefore, hand washing, gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA spreads with droplet infection, contact, but under domestic hospital conditions, there is not always a possibility to separate the infected patient.
Even the hospital rooms are often crowded, often very close to each other, although from an epidemic point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, this can also be experienced, noted Bör<0xC3><0xB8>cz Karolina, that in the unfavorable financial situation hospitals save on disinfectants, few nurses, many patients, so there is even greater chance of developing infections.
According to Bor<0xC3><0xB8>cz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are observed, there is less evidence of such infection or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Programme against MRSA
Managing MRSA is a huge cost to health insurers, which is why they are fighting it everywhere.
In England, for example, the government programme included the prevention and reduction of MRSA.
According to the signs, the program is successful, and the reported data show a decreasing trend of MRSA infections in England.
Priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) include the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
The police officer who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion was prepared on the case of a fatal accident caused by the District XXII Police Captain.
It can be ruled out that he was driving in a state of drunkenness or deprived of his position by the late XXIIth District Police Captain, who gasped a pedestrian to death on Tuesday, Morvai Attila, spokeswoman for the Prosecutor General of the Capital, said on Friday.
The expert's opinion supported the primary test result, which had already found that the former police captain had not consumed alcohol before he was sitting behind the wheel.
The then-captain of the XXIIth district was hit by a 55-year-old man in a corner of Kossuth Lajos street in Kossuth District on Tuesday, with his own passenger car, who did not want to cross the roadside at the designated pedestrian stop.
(The latter, i.e., that the pedestrian does not cross the zebra, under the rules of KRESZ by the way, is not a relief circumstance, the bending car must also give priority.)
The pedestrian lost his life after being taken to the hospital.
Due to the incidents, the district police leader resigned from his position and asked to be placed in a quiet compound, according to the police, because the incident was so shocked.
The Budapest Investigative Prosecutor's Office is investigating the case.
Morvai Attila also pointed out that the former police captain had cooperated with the prosecutors carrying out the investigation from the outset.
An additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million infrastructure
Veres János, Minister of Finance and Marta Gajecka, the European Investment Bank of Budapest, have signed three loan framework agreements of a total of EUR 400 million for education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
The European Development Bank (EIB) has approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million budgetary framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects under cohesion support in Hungary in 2006, of which EUR 200 million in loan contracts are now available to the parties.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan agreement is also used to finance projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million can be used later, with the extension of the loan contract.
In the area of innovation, the parties have signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million contract, which is primarily used for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
The 4th subway was also discussed at the meeting.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the subway with the EU, they will return to whether and how to amend the original contract.
According to Veres János, this will take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded 113 projects in Hungary with a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest on loans shall be provided by the EIB with 8 years of patience and without any maintenance fee.
Bulgaria's EU Real Estate Paradise Package
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is remarkable - the attention of all of Europe is directed to the previously mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who are buying in the EU still the cheapest but fastest expensive market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most prestigious property purchase destination in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and beachfront houses.
Among the mountains are the most fashionable areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the coast of Albena, the "Aranypart", the "Sun Beach", the ancient Sozopol and Neszebar, but more and more are looking for properties in the Kavarna and Balcsik neighborhoods.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria analysts, sooner or later the central part of the country will attract investors – so Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna – and more and more people are buying in the Rusz region.
The capital, Sofia, also boasts attractive opportunities, with commercial and office spaces promising the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its best course to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, making the summer and winter season a top destination for the other two seasons.
For this reason, prospective investors are already making large purchases, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also striving to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
There are also investors in Malta and Cyprus, and there are traditionally many Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Residents either buy renovated properties for between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000, or destroyed old houses for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,000 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000, and then renovate them.
They require good accessibility and communication options, important for them to a big city, shops and generally the proximity to the local doctor.
The second category is for holiday buyers (Bulgaria was included in the list of the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of business investors who are buying in the hope of medium or long-term value growth.
The cost of capital property is continuous as demand increases.
In the European Union, Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, but it has grown by 21 per cent in the last five years.
The rise in real estate prices essentially exceeds the rise in payments.
Fodor and the Six Percent Hungarian
According to information from the Minister of Environment and Water, Fodor Gábor, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers will continue with the post-2012 international climate talks.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are negotiating the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts following the emission-reduction period designated by the 2012 Kyoto Protocol.
There is a strong debate on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not want to negotiate exact figures at the moment, although it tends to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to the 1990 state.
Another major question of the conference is whether the developed countries will also undertake, in addition to reducing emissions, to provide both financial and technological assistance to the countries in need.
There is also an agreement on the grants to be granted to developing countries.
The support fund, which is covered by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member Board of Directors, expected within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - read in Market and Profit.
6 per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for Environment and Water Fodor Gábor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its flagship role in global climate protection efforts and to promote the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 compared to the 1990 level, irrespective of the success of the 'post-2012 agreement', and is ready to take up to 30% of its shares and other shares.
Mr Gábor pointed out that in 1997, a total of 5.2 per cent reductions were achieved by the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol, with the EU - 15 other Member States - undertaken less than 8 per cent.
The Hungarian commitment is a 6 per cent greenhouse gas emission-measure compared to the period 1985-87, which will be fulfilled by our country, according to a press release from the Ministry of Environment.
The stake in Balin is high, as the long-term agreement on international climate policy needs to be brought down within two years, otherwise its entry into force would probably be due to the post-2012 period.In this case, the IP is not required,the reductions under the Kyoto Protocol are not required.
This would result in an emission-reduction delay and an increase in Earth’s average temperature above 2 degrees Celsius would be inevitable, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
On YouTube, a British army is recruited.
Records of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan are being released on the video sharing by British military units, with which they promote their own.
The British Air Force (RAF) first received it on YouTube: special forces operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These miniature footage with helmet-mounted cameras are monitored by the Kandahar Air Force Operations Command and sent to London, where they are uploaded to the Internet.
The Political Message Is Inevitable
The air force’s troops have already recorded 139 footage in this form on the internet, and their “channel” has been viewed by more than 75,000.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and is publishing videos of both Iraqi and Afghan actions, while the British Ministry of International Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and their Iraqi international peacekeepers (MNFI) would also have a YouTube channel.
Immigration to Afghanistan
The air force originally intended to post the videos for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defence, it is also good to know with the general public the true purpose of the army’s foreign presence.
Propaganda in this form is almost in no way expensive compared to traditional, television recruitment ads – said defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC – but it also inevitably carries some political message, as it is confirmed by a special form of right.
The Americans made a game.
The military also has the problem that, in addition to carefully edited, censored footage, amateur videos also appear on the distributor, which, for example, showcase the death of soldiers: their little hypocritical, "official" propaganda movies are not about the blood of the victims, but the blood of the victims.
A number of videos from the Iraqi and Afghan military arena have already been posted on the internet, which was made in sharp incisions, but the British army only recently got it.
Americans are recruited in a slightly different way, with a free-to-download shooter game called America's Army, in which you can hide right into the skin of the soldiers as part of a more or less life-long simulation.
There will be a Christmas in the ministries, and a Christmas in the ministries.
Labour Minister Lamperth Mónica does not seem emotional: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold an annual meeting for her colleagues, who have been able to say goodbye with a cup of coffee since 2007.
There is a ministry where there is a live broadcasting party, with towels and coccinnati to enchant the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of the officials.
Buli, christmas atmosphere, concerts and dessert - this is how the power is fun.
Public offices are preparing for Christmas as well.
The Ministry’s biggest custom Christmas party is held this year by the provincial defense wallet, but HM does not expect the ministry’s employees.
On Arvák Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers are given a gift, and on Mission Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited, but they are also holding a press reception.
The wallet is <0x24>25 million for the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are retiring from the stakes compared to the other portfolios.
The GKM’s party is held in the House of the Future, with a total of 4,320.000 forints, and about three hundred and fifty guests are expected from the six hundred ministerial staff.
At the celebration of the wallet, they will stick to the ambiance of Christmas, but there will be performers and a button will also be assigned.
The NFU’s Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held in the National Justice Council (OIT) building on Wednesday – concerts and dinner.
The venue was worth a million forints, and the remaining part was spent on more than four hundred invitations.
We know that one of the NF<0xC3><0x9C>’s classes is official for another Christmas celebration: this is organised by a tendering company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU money.
For this purpose, the Vígszínáz building was rented.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt because we were unable to reach the competent authority.
You don't need a suit
The building of the ILO not only saw the NFU as a guest, but also the Ministry of Justice and Orders, which organised the Luca Day Ball on December 7 instead of Christmas.
They did not ask for money to use the terms of the ILO.
Five hundred people took part in the ball.
The party started with the Minister’s greeting, and after dinner, he was able to dance for the live stage.
The [origo] question was reported: the ball was not obligatory at all for the evening dress or outfit.
Puritan is organised for the health, work and municipality's portfolio.
The Ministry of Health is organizing a show and celebration for the workers for 400,000 forints in its own building.
However, Labour Minister Lamperth Mónica is not officially waiting for her colleagues for a Christmas party, but for a workshop at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty guests will receive only coffee and cups of coffee, so the party will be brought out from 350,000 forints.
However, the Minister of Municipality of Bainai Gordon will simply coccine with his staff in the hall of the Ministry of Municipality and Territory Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas meeting in its own large room, for which 436 people are waiting.
The Christmas party is for 2500 forints per guest - the amount includes a buffet reception and a cocktail.
Since the Minister Veres János, the PM’s employees have been celebrating the same Christmas every year.
But there will be no bullying, the officiality will be reinforced not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon date.
The agriculture portfolio will receive a new year’s reception on January 20, and the ministry Christmas will be missed.
The reception is held in the Vajdahuniyavar, the City Hall, and according to the portfolio, the 100 guests are allocated 1000 forints per head.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple admission, for which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are official.
These receptions, held each year, begin with a brief ministerial greeting and end with a retracted wallet.
There is no Christmas party held at all by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture, [origo] said in the relevant press departments.
It was not possible to tell the price of the official Christmas of the ecological wallet in the press department.
In all, more than four hundred people were invited to the party held at the Museum of Artists.
The forces of the gigantic strikes are gathering
On Friday, the League of Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Councils will be set up to coordinate the indefinite strike on Monday.
A protesting general assembly will be held on Saturday, and on Monday - on the day of the closing vote on the Health Insurance Act - will begin the cessation of work.
The action will certainly cause a significant impact on traffic, as rail traffic will almost completely stop and strike at the BKV for up to 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League of Trade Unions will present the details of the Monday strike organized jointly with the National Union of Workers’ Councils.
The LIGA – MOSZ strike committee will also be set up to coordinate Monday’s actions.
A protesting general assembly will be held on Saturday, and on Monday, strikers will stop working indefinitely if they are unable to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act, no date has been set for ending the strike that has begun.
If the National Assembly does not, however, adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions shall immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
However, if the legislation is voted on, the strike committees will meet and decide whether to proceed.
Based on the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is also conceivable that the Health Insurance Act will only be voted in the late evening, possibly at night.
Due to the strike that started on Monday, there are significant delays in traffic: work at the railway will be stopped for an indefinite period of time, in the morning a part of Budapest’s public transport may stop, more than half of the Republics of Volán.
At the same time, there will also be a halfway road closure at many points in the country.
A number of trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the strike call, the list of which will be constantly updated tomorrow in the League.
Some organizations have declared an indefinite strike, while others have declared a temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) were not even able to agree on the sufficient service, and as Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel by train.
From the start of the plant to 13 hours, there is a strike at BKV, at Budapest Airport between 7am and 9pm, four hours of strike are being held by the LIGA Villamos and Heat Industry Trade Unions, 2 and 2-8 hours of work are called for the cessation of work.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on a national strike at different times, and the SZEF is holding a two-way warning strike by the Democratic Union of Health and Social Sectors (EDDSZ).
The League’s four main demands are that the government withdraw its proposal for the health insurance reform and introduce a new concept for the social debate.
The second requirement is to gradually introduce a new method of calculating pensions from next year onwards.
The third is to ensure that the age-received pension is available even before 2010 for the workplaces it deserves to be included in the scheme.
The fourth reason for the action is that the League of Trade Unions Railway Free Trade Unions (VDSZSZ) does not accept an offer from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport for the railway wing lines, waiting for another offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard raised the country's risk
With the support of the Movement for Jobbik Hungary, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded in August of this year, raised the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division).
In the company's "risk warning" it was written that the activities of the Hungarian Guard represent the greatest political risk that "there may be a short-term exacerbation of ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy populations of Hungary".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to provoke such an act - added the research institute.
As they wrote, all this can be traced back to the failure of one of the main Hungarian political actors: "the public discussion of the Roma issue was passed on to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who could build a political strategy against the Gypsies".
This deepens the problem, discourages normal dialogue, strengthens the extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard have "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary developed abroad, mainly with regard to the stability of the country and the belief in its democratic development".
It is recalled that since the fall of 2006, the restructuring of Hungarian radical and far-right groups has gained more and more popularity and momentum, and that since the summer of 2007, more and more Hungarian self-defense associations have been organized.
"The common feature of these compressions is that they define themselves as a civil organization, while openly proclaiming the preparation of their members - whether armed - for defence (disaster defense, defence, security, order) as well as the police, the military, the military, the military, or the state."
They noted that all this is done in accordance with the method that seeks to put different political aspirations into civil wear on the basis of the political and partisan opposition of society.
The emphasis on civilization and the form of association is therefore not merely to avoid the legal obstacles of the court record in the case of these associations, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also an increased risk factor in terms of neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, several neighbouring states have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of danger, and ultranationalist politicians from some neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Semitic policies by referring to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region,” he added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, so the political risks for the whole region have increased.
As it was written, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, the establishment of which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the establishment of the Bulgarian Guard are the mass Roma riots that erupted in one quarter of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana).
The BNU took advantage of this decision, saying that the organization is aimed at "national self-defence".
In the past 17 years, according to them, there has been "citizen terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained neutral and indifferent.
They added: the initiative sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As they wrote, the increased risk of ethnic clashes indicates that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that the resistance is suspecting of creating their own barracks.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard shows similarities to the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is therefore not possible to exclude that the Hungarian Roma, in the same way, respond to the threat by organising their own self-defense.
Juhász Attila, Director of Research at Political Capital, told the televised office’s interest: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish their risk analysis annually, and if they experience something that could have an effect on changing the risk, they will inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
There are no red letters for the holiday.
In Hungary, the law accurately marks the red letter days, and around the holidays, the workday rearrangement has become a general practice, which will be less next year.
The holiday is not unified in the EU and America.
The Hungarian legal system differentiates national and state holidays and work breaks.
Work breaks can be linked mostly to church holidays, marked historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the year and the first day of the new - the latter only for the purpose of relaxing the holidaymakers.
All year round we have a total of 11 Red Letters.
The national holiday commemorates the revolution of 1848 on March 15 and October 23, the commemoration day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th, we celebrate the establishment of the state, on May 1st, and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our loved ones who died, our friends.
In addition, we have a two-day celebration of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our public, national or religious holidays are rarely scheduled to fall on the weekend, it has become a practice of relocating a working day in cases where we only work for one day before or after the red letter holiday.
It is true that the price of extended weekends is that on the previous Saturdays we will not stay away from work-school.
The fact that the day immediately before or after the holiday is to be processed exactly when, for many years, the Minister of Labour has been regulated by a separate regulation.
The legislation covers all employers and the workers employed by them, as well as the public servants and those involved in public service law.
However, it does not affect companies and institutions operating without interruption and operating on the days of the work break following its destination.
This year only the holidays of the end of the year are changing: from December 24, life in the country almost stops, as the experiences of the days between Christmas and New Years Eve are the "slide festival" of most people, or they use their spare freedom for this purpose.
Next year we will have more holidays in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer workday relocations than this year.
First, the calendar changes around the holidays of work so that the workers can stay at home for four consecutive days.
Saturday, April 26th, will be a working day in exchange for Friday, May 2.
The second relocation is linked to the October 23rd holiday: on October 18th, you will have to work on Saturday instead of the 24th on Friday.
At the end of the year, however, the holidays can end indefinitely next year, as from December 24, there are almost no-stop breaks everywhere, even when it falls on New Year’s Eve.
Six Disgusting Small Things You Can Make Your Colleagues Angry
E-mails that we forget to send, voicemails that we never receive, innocent lies that we almost never notice: they "color" the everyday lives of the workplace.
The question is whether you are accustomed to minor discomforts or wearing gloves and consciously avoiding misunderstood situations that cause anger to others.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were looking for the marketing department," said one of your colleagues.
That's why you missed a meeting?
In the best case, you will regret and try to correct the matter, or you may call the marketing department to tell you that you forgot to pass the message (this is a less conventional solution).
Most of the time, an apology is made for the matter.
Before an embarrassing apology occurs, it is worth considering what you can do to get unpleasant moments for your colleagues and consciously endeavor to avoid this.
Are you borrowing something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more annoying than touching a document, office or your phone, and it's nowhere.
Remember when you put your lighter on the table last night, but it got up this morning?
Maybe you'll uncover the pen you think is lost on the desk of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking, because they'll be rightly angry at you for stealing their property.
Don’t take your envelopes out of your post office, because it can be unpleasant if you lose weight early, and you’ll need it right away.
Are you kidding about your colleagues' privacy?
There is no good way to stop the rumors that are already spreading.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t tie your statements (assumptions) about your colleagues’ privacy to everyone’s nose!
If one of them shares his deepest secrets with you, don't live up to his trust.
Conceal what you have heard in yourself, and do not negotiate with your colleagues in the distance, even if others know what your colleague is wearing.
Do you report an unintended illness?
When you make a call to the office, and you report a tingling headache to a patient because you feel bad in the middle, or you feel like you’re resting that day; remember that your work, your immediate tasks, your deadline work need to be done elsewhere.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you are not going to go to the office the next day, or that you may have something to do with staying at home, tell your colleagues and boss not to miss you the next day.
Hesitation, whispering, calling
Did you get into the job, but that's why your colleagues' whistle blows you away?
Did you unwittingly witness a phone call that you wouldn't have heard better?
Do not distract your colleagues with dulling, singing, loud conversations (which you continue over their heads), or with leg droppings, continuous injury, loud dissatisfaction.
All of these can be disruptive, even if they don’t really deepen into a single project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for their mistakes?
If something doesn’t have time, you’ve forgotten to send an important letter, a message, don’t blame yourself for forgetting!
Do not refer to the chaos that may be in your office, your loud colleagues!
Admit it if you've made a mistake, and the other one's got a drawback, and you're going to cut the screw.
Ask him how you can correct your mistake, replacing the omission.
Do you feel too comfortable in your office?
Pants and slippers: comfortable clothing for home, but not for the office!
Don’t wear comfortable outfits if your work permits.
Don’t be sloppy, your colleagues, and respect yourself by going into the office in an ordinary dress – if your work requires it, nicely, elegantly!
If you want to answer, you're no longer interesting.
Check-in with the car in the usual breakfast lounge.
A special melody emerges from the radio: a vibrant sound, which is associated with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The music has become rhythmic and the bass comes next to the previous sounds, then a female choir is connected as a real jewel.
Zagar Wings of Love is on mr2.
The domestic music life has long not at all embellished us with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it seems like the plug is completely different when you're listening to the new Zagar record.
Yonderboi’s appearance, some new and exciting productions coming from the domestic digital underground, is slowly changing the overall picture, and despite fashion again, the guitar sealing garage rock, the domestic electropop also proves: it’s new under the sun.
Zs<0xC3><0xA5>ger Balázs started from Pécs, and he also played in the Yonderboi concert hall, until – perhaps because two dudes hadn’t been caught in a chassis – he made his own journey.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance, and pop, however, he began to break through when film soundtracks were asked to be composed (e.g.
(Turkish Francis Season).
His formations in smaller clubs were initially recognized by a wider audience when wan2 magazine ranked his first album in 2002 as one of the 50 most important domestic records, and declared Zagar, the company of Yonderboi to be the only, marketable form in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his musician became "trendy", but of course no one asked them if they would like to wear the label.
The band reacted as needed: they made a new, better record.
The newly released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead opens up new paths for them, although the title itself wants to create continuity with the early years.
It was one of the old bands in that area.
With the airy, airy reference, we would be on the spot, but besides the airliness of the music, it has now emerged - according to the spirit of the age, according to the trend - the effect of the louder guitar, rock and roll.
In these songs, Ligeti György, currently working with The Puzzle, showed himself at the album's Millennial premiere in England.
The album also produced a real radio hit, playing popular music from early morning until late morning, mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi began scamming into the ears of the six domestic singers (“Underground Divas”) with big melodies recorded by Wings of Love.
It's all right (?)
HVG.hu asked Zs<0xC3><0xA5>ger Balázst.
hvg.hu: This new song is now raising the question: how much of the layer you are playing?
Zs<0xC3><0xA5>ger Balázs: The definition of layer music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two kinds of light music casts; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be slippery, unspeakable, and can also be just ready for sale, which makes them commercial.
But a good pop can also come from an honest start.
Your host attitude also works in the spirit of this, regardless of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially west of us, there are greater traditions of lightness.
Not only do the 12-year-olds attend concerts there, but also the older ones.
They are much more attentive to the light musical changes that are taking place around them, because they are also considered part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it’s a good feeling that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
Music is not born for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is more perceptible in concerts, where the effect is already working on each other, but this lies only in the immeasurable changes of the moment.
Still, I've noticed that if you want to respond to the audience, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How much do you plan to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He's working in solitude, and he's built his career west of us.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path, regardless of whether they sometimes try to explain it to our music.
We’re more like team players who trust the other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work was likened to Yonderbo’s music, as many of us had left his music field and started on a different path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love ranked first on the mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi list.
Many people have heard the name Zagar about this number for the first time.
Did you consciously open up with the most popular style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t have a plan to write a hit and then sell the record.
This song is about more.
We were meant to finish the album, trying to solve the soundtrack on the album and the harder themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly did they - what was the control?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like chorus.
Then came the idea of compiling this chorus from the soundtracks of our own home music scene.
This is how the hexagonal choir – Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enik<0xC5><0x91> [Neo], Németh Juci – was composed, which was then renamed Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you design this song or did the girls make it like this?
Zs.B.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, and then when the disc material merged, we thought we needed something else for this number.
She drew the chord to make me sing it.
That night, I sang to him the song that the girls learned later.
It was almost the first time and it all came spontaneously.
I remember very excited at the time, but of course, the diva needed it.
It wouldn't have worked so hard with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
There are no solos (except for Judy Jay’s short solos), they have no own roles, they sing together completely and no louder than music, so the music doesn’t just accompany their songs.
They were on the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the back was simply because of technical problems.
But we are aware that we didn’t want to share solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where it came from, where it goes, just let those certain wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Who has worked with the most?
Zs.B.: In fact, there were harder pieces than any of the musical creative process, rather than the mix.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play in a racing tournament, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to run the groove for a long time, and then pretty slowly everything stood in place like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: What’s your favorite number on the new album?
Zs.B.: It’s constantly changing with the concert and with the fact that I’ve already released the album.
Now the Prophet is a fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
The traitor broker risked billions due to feelings of inferiority
It's uncool.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the Société Générale de France, so called his former employee, Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerville, he lost almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion.
However, it seems that the not at all talented Kerviel was rather just a great player who wanted to imitate his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognized the US mortgage market crisis in a timely manner.
"Decreased mental capacity," he said from the officers who informed the police.
However, as the French Le Monde reported, Kerviel’s confession reveals that he earned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion from his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"I just wanted to make money from my bank," he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
It was well worth the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, it was reported that there would be problems with the so-called subprime liabilities provided to customers with low-income or past cancellation issues.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerville didn't believe it and made a good horse.
At the end of the year, the profit reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion.
"Even when I was looking for the first half-billion, I didn't know how to register," Kerviel admits, adding that he didn't hold anything for himself.
In his confession, he admits that he falsified his reports so that it could not be found.
He also managed to scam his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange began to question his trades.
Risk was a profit.
Were you afraid it would turn out?
Preferably not.
“I thought it was just the fact that I was looking for <0x24>1.6 billion to the bank that would reassure them.”
Where did you get your will to risk that much?
He gradually reached his position.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked at Société Générale Bank since 2000.
His annual salary was around <0x24>51,000.
Two years later, he was a broker assistant and became an independent broker in 2005 with a salary of <0x24>90,000 a year.
Still, he knew that he would never make as much as others.
“In my first conversation in 2005, I knew they were looking at me with the wrong eye.
My graduation, my professional and personal development," Kerviel told the investigators.
Not long after his entry, the first big success came.
Allianz’s shares are the result of a loss of half a billion euros in London’s bombings.
And that started his lavender - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, let's go
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses were supposed to know all about it, or rather, they've been stabbed.
"While I was making money, my eyes disappeared."
However, a collision occurred at the beginning of the year.
In a single day, he lost <0x24>1 billion.
He was trying to get me out on a weekend in mid-January.
When he went to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion.
And how did they find out?
He became suspicious of his freedom.
“Last year I only took four days.
A broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his reports,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has a chance to acquire <0x24>365 billion
The Czech Government’s ministers have signed a total of nine operational programmes with the representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic may acquire <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>365 billion) over the next few years.
The Czech Republic is about the total amount obtained from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
The regions will receive about 125 billion crowns out of seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to earn around 100 billion krona from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program.
Most of the money, 150 billion kroner, is for transportation.
The Transportation Program is the largest operating program and accounts for 22 per cent of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
This money will increase the state fund for the Transport Infrastructure, which will be managed by 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program assists entrepreneurs and companies in acquiring tools for innovation enterprises.
Companies should have the resources to introduce new technologies, industrial research, but also to introduce more efficient organizational methods.
To date, the Czech Republic is among the least successful in earning money from EU funds within the newly admitted countries.
Former President of Nicaragua sentenced to 20 years in prison
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday approved a 20-year sentence for Arnold Alemán, the former president of the country, who was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of <0x24>100 million (almost 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest in his hamlet near the capital.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 will return behind bars is unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Perez, it will depend on the administration of the prison whether Germany's sentence will be dropped at home or returned to prison.
The court proved to Germany four years ago that it regularly referred money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
In reality, these fictional companies and their account numbers were relatives and their closest supporters.
Some of this money was subsequently spent at the foundation, which was founded to finance Germany’s 2001 election campaign.
We have approved our budgets.
That's right.
They have approved the state budget.
Why is this budget so special?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government, adopted by a coalition majority, without the support of the opposition.
This year even passed with the support of the Social Democrats last year, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Socialist Party could not afford to accept the non.
Unlike a loud debate about the mistrust of the government before the vote, there was no drama this time around.
The House of Representatives adopted this generally overlooked, albeit the most influential law.
That's a certain contradiction.
All governance starts and ends with individual chapters and items in the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the power struggles between the government and the opposition.
It is more grateful so in the press, which is why it gets much more attention in the media.
Politicians’ debates are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The government budgets of past Social Democrats have faced three shortcomings that the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of them is the high proportion of mandatory, so-called mandate spending law, which is not only the pension, but also the social benefits, which was approved last year by the silent "coalition" between <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M before the elections.
The second, as a result of the first deficiency, is deficit management.
The third limit is the deficits in public funding, i.e. the deficits in the budgets of cities and roads.
However, the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
It is public and relatively controlled.
Timed bombs are deficits in the budget of cities and roads.
In addition to money from taxes, taxes and bank loans, a number of mayors were able to earn money for other investments, inexplicably often issued bonds with which their town halls were disproportionately indebted.
In recent years, these debts have been eliminated by mass sales of shares in energy and other distribution networks, which have been received from the state through privatizations.
They no longer have such resources.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we will determine that:
For a few years, like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a phase of growth, which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly proud of.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to arrange for public funding.
Instead, the country was increasingly indebted to it.
The other countries, with two exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, were much more rational than the Czech Republic.
This is primarily the great shame of the previous governments.
We are one of the countries at the global level which is the least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need, for example, for massive social programs, which unfortunately have become completely superfluous in recent years.
Although this year we have been able to eliminate some of the pointless populist spending approved before the elections this year, even if there is no way to push the retirement frontier and pension reform in the near future, there is a real end to this country, no matter what age, no matter what policy.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that most of the money taxed from governing politicians usually turns into their mechanical distributors of pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, the budget for this year cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the reduction of normal expenditure by commissioning expenditure.
The <0x24>70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely superfluous if previous governments hadn’t done everything they could have done in the last decade.
If we do not want it to really become mere officials of the governing politicians, then we must be patient and we must wish for peace in the preparation of further reform laws, which is not too strong, aware of the fact that the coalition governments can only be given the power to
These are the only ones that will allow for the gradual attainment of a balanced budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of America, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Great Britain, Switzerland, and Canada have decided to jointly fight the monetary crisis.
In this way, the money markets will cost more than <0x24>100 billion through the stock market.
On this stock exchange, the bank raises the interest rate for which I am ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will issue <0x24>40 billion on the stock exchange, and another <0x24>24 billion will be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
For the first time since the September 11 attacks, the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This move should solve the biggest problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl, an advisor to Economic Outlook Group, wrote in the report.
“The coordinated action of central banks in the United States has reduced the likelihood of a recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl said in a statement.
Banks have already lost <0x24>60 billion in the U.S. due to unsecured loans.
Analysts expect billions of more losses.
“Central banks can really worry about what might happen even if they decide on such a procedure,” said Kieran Davies, general manager of ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing their loans, they will also give more expensive loans to their borrowed clients.
This would reduce the need and put the American economy in a recession with the possible consequences for the world’s economic growth.
The central banks then decided that the so-called LIBOR failed to reduce the interbank supply rate, which is used to borrow money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of reciprocal loans, despite the fact that the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had cut their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as further interest rate cuts," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks’ move will contribute to countering the crisis as it does not solve the sub-profit problem of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The Incredible Controversy of Ecologists
Global climate change is the biggest threat to developing countries in the world.
President Václav Klaus re-opened his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticized the UN conference on climate change held in Balin.
The book Blue, not the green planet, presented in Vienna, made the debates of ecologists unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is made up of a special mixture of representatives of governments and civil organizations, but also the fundamental difference between rhetoric and reality that accompany it.
“The debate there is absolutely lacking the structure, it’s just a word-for-word throw, which is an alternative to solving the current problems,” Klaus said.
In presenting the book, the President of the Czech Republic stressed that it was very important for his subject and that is why he was so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book also appears in German translation, because, as he said, "often I only encounter the cartoons of my opinion".
So now your interested ones can read your not-distorted opinion.
Klaus reminded me that although he is not a climatologist, in his opinion he has sufficient grounds for writing such a book.
Since he is able to monitor and judge professional meetings, he is also experienced as an academic in statistics and an economist.
At the end of the book, he pointed out as a thesis that the climate is constantly changing, i.e., its changes are normal, and there is no unanimous opinion of all scientists regarding global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are unprecedented and unprecedented.
In addition, as a person with experience in the field of totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction to freedom.
On the questions of the attendees, he repeatedly explained that "it is not against the reasonable protection of the environment, but against the militiamen environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke about a similar subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people have not been able to change their licenses.
Six hundred thousand drivers delayed the deadline and were unable to replace the old licence in time, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last time they will be able to request an exchange that offices will be able to issue the new licence in due course by the end of the year.
The ministry, however, is not afraid that after the New Year, one hundred thousand drivers will leave without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the license has not been replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the trips are a sharp drop in interest in the exchange of licences, the capital offices have been inundated with requests for the exchange of licences, for which interest has increased this week.
The mayor’s office receives about 2,000 customers a day.
It's about half an hour in a row.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their license.
The issuance of a new licence takes 20 days.
However, the new licence can also be requested with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver will have to pay more than five hundred crowns.
Drivers who are unable to exchange their compulsory licence by the end of the year and start driving with an invalid licence are threatened by a penalty from January.
The criminal must pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police can resolve the expulsion by agreement.
In case of administrative failure, the penalty is 2500 crowns.
Based on previous information from the city council, you may also be fined if you are not traveling anywhere.
It is estimated that you can pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has earlier called on officials to be excused and to impose up to a thousand crown penalties.
Transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said tens of thousands of fines would not threaten anyone.
He believes that a license is a document in which people can decide whether they want to or not.
This is not a passport that should be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive should quit their license.
It is enough to take it or recommend it by post to the appropriate office.
The licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers need to gradually replace the other types of licences as well.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 can be exchanged for another three years.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
Court Reduces Punishment of Allied Investigators in Berdycchel
Josef Opava and Petr Kon<0xC5><0x9B>a<0xC5><0x99>ík were former police officers suspected of merging with David Berdych's conspiracy, who were sentenced to thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague has decided on this with a final effect, which reduced their sentences for one of them by one or two years.
Investigators of the Prague Organized Crime Division were initially threatened with 14 and 12 years in prison.
Today’s decision can no longer be appealed, a review can only be appealed to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdyche is also suspected in this case, he is only awaiting a first-degree verdict.
In other proceedings, he has been sentenced to more than 16 years in total.
You can't get more.
In January, the County Court found 19 people primarily guilty of robbery, of which the Supreme Court today filed 16 appeals.
The majority of the defendants have denied the allegations since the start of the investigation, saying it was a speculative case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, members of the police, other than after Berdycchel's agreement, provided criminals with information from police sources, detected the individual robberies and helped the gang avoid the criminals.
The gang therefore gave 30 percent of the theft to Opava and Kona<0xC5><0x99>í.
The prosecution is about the gang's crimes from 1999 to 2001.
First and foremost, these are robberies whose victims have often suffered serious harm to their health, but also abuse of the powers of a civil servant and unauthorized arms-keeping.
As the police found guns, steel bullets, laser targets, or machine guns illegally held during Home Investigations.
The gang said the robberies had stolen tens of millions of crowns.
The 20-member gang was found guilty of Berdych’s other robberies in this case, and many others.
Other members of Berdych's environment are also testifying before the court in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first-degree trial has so far avoided Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Puta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulejt, who are in Ireland’s preliminary detention where they are waiting for a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Account for child exchange: <0x24>12 million
Igor Veleba, the lawyer of the affected families, is demanding 12 million kroner pain fees from the hospital in Trbí<0xC4><0x8D> plus court expenses.
Three million per head for mothers, two million for fathers and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál Veleba, disagrees fundamentally with the proposal.
"We reject this claim because it's too much," Dostál said after today's hearing.
"In order to form an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert opinion drawn up by the opponent.
We will determine whether there is any useable value.
But we retain our view that this will be measurable in hundreds of thousands for everyone,” Dostál said.
He believes the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablonov family wanted a million crowns for each month, until she raised her own biological daughter.
Veleba served as the expert judgement on the basis of the compensation negotiations, which was developed by Motol University Hospital in Prague.
The children’s parents, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, suffered from various degrees and depths of mental harm and stress.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even if they encountered eyelashes that did not prevent the replacement of the newborn.
Women are facing worse with the actuality of the trauma they have experienced and with what is happening right now, she summarized the content.
Veronika and Nicholas were replaced by Sisters at the birth of Tr<0xC3><0xB8>bí<0xC4><0x8D> on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their blood parents - Nikola <0xC4><0x8C>ermáké in P<0xC5><0x99>íbyslavice, Veronika Libor in Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslav Trojan in Jablonov.
Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina’s head of walkway, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, handed over 100,000 crowns to the families at the end of October to replace their expenses, which were caused by a mistake in the hospital in Trebi<0xC4><0x8D>sk, which is controlled by the walkway.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic have compulsory health insurance under the law.
In the event of a mistake, they must reach the backup base, in exceptional cases they can ask for help from the founder.
The courts have so far approved relatively low compensation for people, the amounts were calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases a few million kroner tables.
Polivka has lost the kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko
Bolek Polívka lost a minute to the title of the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
According to the court of the district court of Ostrava, although for the first time he used the royal name of Valachi, the project was developed by a team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who cooperated with the painting, with many years of work.
Polivka did not attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about the popularity of Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the letter.
He thinks the words of the Valachi Kingdom come to everyone's mind about the actor-comic.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> also shares this opinion.
“We have almost 10 years of work behind us.
Investigation of money and inventory of shares,” he said.
She thinks life is about money.
“Years later they realized that the project was successful and they could benefit from it.
They want to take advantage of our work,” he added.
Profit-making business
According to the court, the name "King of Valachi" was first used by Polívka in a television show.
In 1993, Radoslav Brzobohaty was crowned.
At that time, however, this was not related to the purpose of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came forward with the idea of issuing the Valachi passports.
The original student loan action became a business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, after which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> founded the establishment of the company in the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
In 1997, Polívka agreed with the name and signature of the passports, and even recommended discounts to their owners when visiting their farm and theatre performances.
Who will occupy the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> had only used the idea, which Polívka had made public in Manesia.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polyvka certainly helped the Valachi Kingdom project," the judge said.
However, he added that the spirit of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who worked intensively on it.
The cooperation of the parties to date continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> Polívka was formally crowned in Vsetin.
Since then, however, there have been disputes between Polivka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which have led to "the remission of the eternally elected King Boleslav."
She assumed the leading role in the kingdom at the initiative of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ulaková as mother queen.
In 2002, Polívka Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his colleagues filed a lawsuit, which the court rejected today.
The battle for the throne and for the queen could bring light to the debate.
There should be a new king out of this fight.
He didn't want to tell me the details and the date.
“We don’t want to catch anything.
It's supposed to be something like the Slovak king's trial.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also apply in peace," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot Test: Disappearing Prejudices
Honestly, I never liked the Peugeot 206.
The characteristics of the process are nothing special, the quality of the change, the management and the production can often be referred to as below average.
But its already existing successor on the market, the Peugeot 207 is significantly better.
And the SW's van goes a little further, so it's only left to me to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, for example, I complained about the place left behind my head in the rear seat.
This time, the complaint is over here, because the body of the van means that the two-meter-high giants are not suffering anymore in this regard.
Pride in the World
I'll go through the interior soon so I don't repeat myself many times.
It is a relatively successful design, where my only objection is to the poor console.
Here I would appreciate a little more designer invention if the exterior of the car is already so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or the wrists.
Side driving also improved significantly compared to the 206 model.
As for the space, there is also a noticeable increase in the size of the body.
In the combi, after that, the already mentioned few places of the head disappear.
Leather bags in the baggage holder
The most important thing in this vehicle is the luggage.
This is very well-accessible (even thanks to the folding rear windows) and a spacious feel to be appreciated.
Empty spaces are equipped with retaining tyres, which are ideal compromises.
They’re not on the road, they’re detachable and they can handle even heavier objects.
But let's stay at the volume for a while.
This is based on the tables in the base arrangement of 428 l, which is more of an average value compared to the competition.
However, in the Czech Republic it is not the most sought after car of this type - against the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the young Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is far behind the noticeable 52 litres.
For a holiday abroad or a baby carriage, this value is almost critical.
But if I should highlight the positives, then I still have to mention the almost completely straight floor after the backs of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was supplied with a four-wheel drive motor with a capacity of 1.6 litres, 88 kW.
And truthfully, that's how it should look like the one hundred thousand who runs the family hatchback.
Quiet, small intake and pulls primarily.
Compared to the <0xC5><0xA0>koda equivalent, which often seems to have been stuck in its exhaust, I can only be happy with it.
Suggest the price
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we must remember that we tested a car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The four-wheel drive car will go for 329 900 CZK with a foreign engine.
The car starts at 410 990 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment will throw away the equipment for an additional 80,000 CZK.
However, we even had our head bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic window wiper start, rear windows and electric remote control.
That is, the car costs 531 900 CZK with a tok-trailer.
This is a lot, but calculate the equipment of the Fabia supplement and you get very similar results.
There is nothing left but a decision with the brand.
Failure to integrate Slovak students into UK schools
In the UK schools, more and more Eastern European children are raising concerns among the locals about the further development of the local school issue.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases of disputes between the children of immigrants and the children of domestic residents that have become violent.
Problems related to the integration of Eastern European children are well illustrated by a case in North West, where there is a growing dispute between their places and Slovak immigrants.
Disputes and bonds between students are already characteristic of parents’ relationships.
In Chatham, police detained a Slovak woman who hit a 10-year-old student with an iron rod.
The culprit defends him by insulting him with racist Shits.
The police had to act after two 12-year-old girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly mocked the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we got home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started staring at us.
When I told her to stop this, she stabbed us with apples and circles, and then she discovered her naked back,” the mother of the Slovak students described another unpleasant case to The Times.
There are complaints on both sides.
One of the locals described the debates about immigrants in Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The above-mentioned cases indicate that in the UK schools, the mood between locals and immigrants is starting to become tense.
Approximately 70,000 Slovaks are looking for jobs in the UK.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be accomplished if you choose the right choice.
The golden and white shores, high waves, or sea, calm like a fisherman.
Palm trees and all-inclusive on the beach with waitresses offering pizza, ice cream or mackerel cocktails.
Surfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean islands, you can find this in an even richer list.
On one island, however, you can find much more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the base of American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasure warehouse and a shipment that the Spaniards abducted in America and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel was built in the late 1920s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the U.S. mafia, was built because everything that was considered a crime in the U.S. (primarily sectarianism), was welcomed in Cuba, and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among the guests were, for example,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
Tower houses were built in Havana, on wide streets, cars that became a symbol of cult in the 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway purchased property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojímar.
The walls of the Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with signatures of American showbusiness stars and politicians.
What about today?
The wall of Bodeguita in Havana can also be provided by hand.
In the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel you can enjoy cocktails at your request.
And the 1950s cult cars are still on the way to Havana, as the once exported jigsaws and boys have long since been thrown away in this salty and wet air.
Although mainly the oldest part of Havana has been significantly destroyed, there are no more beautiful colonial monuments in the area than there.
Other places are getting more and more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Given the fact that tourism provides so much money as necessary, the development has received a green path.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another unique cuisine in the world, which is appreciated primarily by train lovers.
From their extensive plantings, sugar cane was transported to the sugar mills with steam and engine extracts.
Their fleet has not been renovated for decades, so machines operating there can be seen, whose contemporaries can only be seen elsewhere in museums.
Where do we start the journey?
Most of the most famous places in Cuba are not avoided.
So there is no need to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should just remind you that there is a museum on the Hemingway estates already mentioned, and those who love the writer should not miss a visit to this museum.
The Viñales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the slaughterhouse.
Masonry formations, chalk-beams and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and have fertile soil accumulated in their hollows, thanks to which the scattered slopes are covered by dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
They can meet in their final form when visiting one of Havana’s cigar-producing plants.
Some may also find it interesting that it was there that they filmed Major Zeman's Chilean episode.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded not long after the colonization of the Spanish islands.
The slave trade and the sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy is a body carved in the beauty and monumentality of a not too large city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, significantly influenced by the later French settlements, has changed almost nothing in the course of four centuries.
The area between the Escambray plain and the sea is so secluded that even in the 1950s, there were no roads connecting the country with the rest of the country.
That kind of isolation helped him to stay out of the way.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't break it down, everyone was glad that they had a roof over their head.
If you have more than one afternoon in Trinidad, it is worth visiting some of the interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón Coast or the Valley of Sugar Mills.
And in the evening it is appropriate to go to the Casa de la Música, which after dark you wake up, where the music is only quiet for the morning.
Baracoa
Some of the cities in the eastern part of Cuba are considered to be the most beautiful.
I am sure that this opinion is already influenced by the way.
Both routes from Guantánamo to Guantanamo must overcome tall and divided mountains, which are almost unaffected by human activity.
Cuba's eastern native language has been added to the World Heritage List by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
Here you will find the best chocolate, the church has the Columbus Cross (in fact made a hundred years after Columbus's cruise) and the hill where the former castle was built, and today the El Castillo hotel is located, a few tablestops can be seen, of which the most famous of which is El Yu.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Meastro plain, Diszno Bay and Isla de Pinos Island, Tropicana cabaret, Caridad del Cobra, the patron saint of Cuba, Santería, the African religion that can be told about the descendants of the former slaves.
As they say, it’s better to see it once.
Afghanistan’s Allies Are Passive, Americans Say
Few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment also affect the operation of the United States mission in Afghanistan.
Defence Minister Robert Gates said NATO should outline concrete plans for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not in line with the idea, it was established by the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, whose units are in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating countries are also consulting on further plans and coordination of the Allies.
While the U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called for greater activity this week for NATO troops, the UK considers strengthening the Afghan government and strengthening development assistance to be the priority.
“Afghan development can be tangible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the public to initiate further developments in the economy and security themselves," Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety per cent
The Afghan insurgents’ activity is the strongest in the last five years, according to the U.S. government.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent compared to last year and by 60 per cent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern regions.
However, according to the United States, the Allies have also reached their limits in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were asked to bend Afghan troops.
“We need to think carefully about the specific goals for the future and the methods to achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar spirit, Jaap de Hoop, NATO’s secretary general, spoke today.
“I’m not happy with what’s happening in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and the equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told the Reuters news agency at the end of a three-day talk with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been debate among the participating countries as to whether or not all allies will reach the maximum level in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively large in existence in Afghanistan.
However, they have been deployed in areas where the minimum levels of violence and war requirements are not as high against them as against us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British newspaper Sun called the German soldiers "sluts".
"Afghan sunspots are dead: Germans are playing while our sons are fighting," the Sun wrote in a photo supplemented by German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild was in a counterattack and a British team published a photo of a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt reaches <0x24>1 billion in 2009
Each Czech Republic has a government debt of 84,000 kroner.
At the end of September, the total debt reached 842.7 billion crowns.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
In early December, however, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kroner thanks to a better development of the state budget.
At the end of September, the Czech Republic’s public debt reached 842.7 billion kronor.
During the nine months of this year, this increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance today confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
Each Czech Republic receives more than 84,000 crowns in debt.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion crowns.
"At the moment, it seems that due to the lower deficit next year, we could only exceed the one-billion-dollar limit in 2009.
Next year, the debt will move around 900 billion and a trillion kroner,” said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, to iHNed.cz.
According to Next Finance analyst Vladimir Pikora: “In 2009, we will be able to go through a trillion.
That exactly when, it depends on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it were to prove that the situation in politics would change, the politicians would be willing to save more, which could be delayed by 2010.
But I don’t expect this change,” he said.
Increasing debts
State debt is made up of central government debts, which is primarily caused by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
State debt is financed by banknotes, government bonds, direct loans, or loans from the European Investment Bank, for example.
The state’s domestic debt has so far increased from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kronor this year.
The state’s foreign debt has so far increased from 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion crowns.
At the end of September, the so-called public debt reached 803.3 billion SEK and decreased by 13.7 billion SEK from June.
The average public debt ratio has risen to 6.5 years.
“The debt over the entire year increased by 13 per cent in the first quarter, which is actually enough for the economy’s progress.
Interestingly, the increase is primarily generated by bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
The bad thing is that debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be a way to trade if there is a pension reform,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the 2007 management of public debt show that the government planned to borrow HRK 159.2 billion this year.
In early December, however, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The amount is primarily the government budget deficit, which is likely to reach the supposed 91.3 billion crowns this year instead of the 76 billion crowns.
In addition, the Czech Consolidarity Agency is planning a maximum of 13.3 billion kroner, 10 billion kroner reserves for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kroner for the financing of government bonds and 1 billion kroner for the European Investment Bank.
The teacher will appear in a cartoon court today for the name of a plush lady
A Carthage court on Thursday sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and exile from the country for violating Islam in Sudan, a lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6-7-year-old pupils to be called Mohammed, but Islam forbids any depiction of her prophet.
Such an act can be punished with a whip.
The 54-year-old British woman, a teacher at Unity High School in Carthusia, was detained in her own apartment on Sunday. Under paragraph 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, she was accused of violating Islam and insurrection after her parents were more of a kindergarten.
The story began in September when the teacher asked 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class’s plush pupil.
“The children suggested eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said Robert Boulos, the school’s director.
Finally, out of 23, 20 children voted for the surname Mohammed.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the prophet of Islam, but it is also a very common surname in Sudan.
The children then made a joint diary with the cat's photo and the inscription "My name is Mohammed".
The problem is that the prophet's depiction of any kind is an insult to Islam, and that he was not labeled with that name on his own skull.
One of Gillian Gibbons, a Muslim colleague in the same school, said that she knew him well and that the teacher had never done anything that would offend any religious beliefs. She said that she was just "innocent" and said, "I'm sorry."
Many students of the teacher agree with this opinion. They think the teacher "is very good at dealing with children" and "never talks about religion in the classroom".
Remember that Mohamed is also the second most popular surname in the UK, and there are 14 different spelling methods in English.
This is one of the ways in which Muslim families so often choose a surname to express their respect for the Prophet. (This name is often given to the first-born child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the surname?
Can you get that name, for example, a game?
It's obviously a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement at the last Vienna hearing on Wednesday on the future status of the province.
The end result: failure.
The meeting between the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, ended with the sixth and last meeting on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is unfortunate that the parties have not reached an agreement on the status," EU diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger told a press conference in Vienna.
U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region is "turning on the cheek" and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises of peace and dialogue even after the talks.
"In the near future, there is no need to keep from violence, but a very difficult period is coming," he added, stressing the "clear existence of tensions".
The mediation ends on December 10th.
On Monday, the European Union, the United States and Russia will be visited for the last time by an intermediary troika in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the region inhabited by 90 percent of Albanians could be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bocan-Harchenko submitted their report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
A meeting in the vicinity of Vienna, Baden, was the sixth and last meeting of the negotiations since the UN entrusted the Troika with further mediation in August last year.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation tasks will be completed on December 10.
The Russians, who have already denied the independence of Kosovo in the Security Council, have insisted that negotiations continue even after the deadline has expired.
"Russia was committed and will remain the negotiating solution, the compromise," Bocan-Harchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo had been under UN control for eight years, the Western powers believe that independence under the EU’s supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was ready to unilaterally declare independence if the Security Council is not in her favour.
Belgrade will continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we were unable to reach an agreement," said Fatmir Sejdiu, president of the independent province of Kosovo, at the hotel in Baden, where "the last chance negotiations" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the Kosovo uprising and the upcoming prime minister of the province, also expressed regret.
He added, however, that his idea of Belgrade's autonomy would be "a continuation of the past, which leads to murders and deportations".
"Domino Effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic believed that a compromise was still possible and warned the Kosovo Albanian majority of the consequences of the unilateral declaration of independence.
In fact, Belgrade considers it a "domino-effect" due to the independence wars of the 1990s still unstable in the region.
"For Serbia, this does not preclude the possibility of compromise," Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation voted again that the decision should be exclusively to the Security Council, where the Russian ally has the right to veto.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will be the last word"
"For Serbia, only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
“The negotiations have been going on for two years.
They must end at the same point where they started: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will be the last word", adding that the unilateral declaration of independence on the part of Albanians is based on "agreement" with the Western powers.
Bush urges Israeli-Palestinian deal
On Tuesday, President George W. Bush announced at the opening of his international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have agreed to immediately begin negotiations between their people to finalize the 60-year-old debate.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush promised to support them in all possible ways in order to sign the "peace treaty" in 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians have to register "terrorist networks" and Israel has to give up its colonial activities, Bush said, reminding the two sides of their commitments to the 2003 "peace plan".
The head of the White House stressed that the Abbas-led negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel are aimed at “signing a peace treaty that resolves all dependent problems, including central issues.”
The latter deals with three sensitive issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict, who lived in the territory of today’s Israeli state.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that future negotiations should be "global and in-depth" and touch on all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, the asylum, the borders, the colonies".
Olmert then pledged that future negotiations "will be direct and continuous" and he will endeavor to "end them until 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush pushed for the realization of “two-state visions” between Palestinians and Israelis.
Saudi Arabia said it had received a promise from Bush before he decided to take part in the conference.
Saudi Arabia (whose participation in Annapolis was credited by Washington as a success) with the support of all Arab countries, has launched a plan that guarantees peace to Israel if it withdraws in return from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis “is an answer in the history of the Middle East, especially because it takes root in the problem and focuses on central issues,” the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi Arabian Arab daily.
The prosecutor says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with news of this kind, official positions and speech contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of an investigation initiated by the National Police General Inspectorate (IGPN) on Sunday, a police car passed on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel, just a few minutes after 17 hours.
"The car was on its way, so it didn't take part in any action. It ran at speeds of 40-50 km/h, without sirening," a police source said.
The two young without helmets were driven "high-speed" by a green, "not in the official registry, therefore not to be used on the road" (see below) with a Kawasaki-branded engine.
"Because they did not follow the right-hand rule, the engine collided between the left side of the police car," a police officer said.
The results of the alcohol test were negative for the passengers of the vehicle.
It shows well the strength of the collision, that the front of the car has collapsed, the windshield star has cracked and the bumper has broken.
Attorney Marie-Thérèse de Givry said in a press release yesterday morning that she had entrusted the IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Security Administration with the investigation, which had been "accused" of human murder and aid.
During the afternoon, the prosecutor told a press conference that at the current stage of the IGPN investigation, the responsibility of the police could be excluded.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses who were interviewed on Sunday night confirmed "the police report that the wreck arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car".
Yesterday, from a strip that was undoubtedly pulled by the pedestrians on the road, it was shown that the two vehicles collapsed and passed together for a while until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles were detained for technical inspection purposes.
Yesterday, the body of the two victims was examined by a medical expert.
What happened right after that?
The speech in Villiers-le-Bel, which took place yesterday, said police quickly left the scene without providing assistance to the two young men.
In this regard, the IGPN is cautious, but excludes that the police have committed "any serious mistake".
"This is the hardest part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation and increased precautionary measures during the investigation," a police source said.
The Libération met a witness who reported the incident a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of his apartment looks exactly at the location.
"My cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, and I immediately went down to try and revive them," the witness said.
"We haven't done anything yet."
Then he noticed "a policeman who was completely confused and sanitized.
The other two tried to revive one of the young men, and the fourth called.”
Among the attendees, tensions increased as the hopeless situation of the two young men became apparent, so the upcoming police escorted their colleagues from the scene by car.
We also know from the witness's statement that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left".
They also used heart massage, but in vain.
“I wouldn’t say that the police didn’t try to help the young people.
The young people have been helped.
The firefighters arrived at the scene immediately.
They did everything they could to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tension Increases in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police stopped the first demonstrations two days earlier, after General Musarraf introduced a state of emergency.
Witnesses say around two thousand lawyers in the eastern part of the country, in Lahore, were injured by light gas bombs used by law enforcement forces to protest measures in the state of emergency.
In response, they threw stones at police officers, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and wounded the lawyers.
Several people have been produced.
Lawyers registered by the Supreme Court in Islamabad called for a general strike and protests for the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed in order to prevent the assembly.
In the central part of the country, there were also several protests in Multan and northwestern Peshawar.
Since Monday, the lawyers have been supported by a huge Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance that includes religious parties, and its leader has “encouraged the people to send flowers to those judges who disagree with the state of emergency, who disagree with Musa, and those who disagree with it.”
"Musharraf's promise is no longer valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, the Court must declare the legality of President Musarraf’s re-election by indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced by another.
“Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the president told The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise that he would leave the military to serve as a civilian president has "lost his dignity" after the emergence of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
Musarraf had to change his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Information Minister also confirmed news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has, by the way, rejected the nationwide speech that said President Musarraf would have been nominated as a coercive general’s seat.
More than one-third of pregnancies are unplanned
This result includes unwanted (24%) and inappropriate or unplanned pregnancy.
Even today, more than one-third (36%) of pregnancies are unplanned, according to a study by the French National Demographic Institute (Ined) forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act to liberalize contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) and inappropriate or unplanned pregnancy.
According to Ined, various methods of contraception, such as a tablet or a bee spiral, still fail in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalization of contraception has made "birth control" more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women between the ages of 20 and 44 took contraceptive pills in 1970, but today it is 6% of them.
8 out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
Every five months, it is planned with precision, and if possible, for spring, as this is the most favorable season for a child to receive.
Spectacular improvements to the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to carry out a vision of the space station, which is essential for scientific activity.
This dangerous spaceship has also proved to be a record in many respects: the repair took a very long time, it had very little time to plan, and away from the residential modules, it had to be done with the tools "scratched" by the astronauts.
The problem arose on Tuesday when the astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a giant cylinder-shaped element that will soon be the site of scientific laboratory activities in Europe and Japan (see the enclosed section).
This module is a kind of gateway to laboratory modules.
However, it is necessary to take care of their electricity supply.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to move one of the modules generating electricity, which was already on the ISS, to its final location using 17.5-ton solar panels.
The crew then began opening the module’s 76-metre-wide solar panels.
One of the harmoniously folding boards damaged one of them in a length of about one meter.
To avoid further damage, the opening of the table was not continued.
The original task of the astronauts was to take a scrutiny walk from the Discovery spacecraft and then repair another damaged rotational solar panel. Instead, they had to spend their full time repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was given the choice to do the demonstration by hanging on a 30-metre robotic arm attached to the station's gear.
He's one of NASA's best astronauts.
It is tall, strong, extremely skilled, muscular in the upper body and has a long arm.
The 46-year-old doctor had to "operate" the "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully examining the damage incurred, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed the damaged area with a few "shades".
He was also assisted by another "astronaut" who remained close to the safe passageway, as well as other astronauts inside, including the crew captain, Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bot, was sold with insulation against hundreds of volts of solar panels, was invented by the spacecraft of the station and "scratched" together.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for his colleagues to fully open the board, and only then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts had a half-day rest, and then today at seven weeks they returned to the Discovery spacecraft to begin their planned return home on Wednesday.
The exchange rate of EADS shares is decreasing
The exchange rate of EADS shares on the Paris Stock Exchange has fallen sharply after a company that manufactures aircraft and protective equipment announced that the delay in the development of the A400M would result in an additional cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion.
The exchange rate for EADS shares is currently <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96 after a 4% decline.
The company had to revise its forecasts for the 2007 operating result as the development of the A400M engine was delayed, which apparently delayed the delivery of the aircraft at a later date.
The delay in the delivery of the fighter carrier aircraft, which was announced in October, "will cost between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion, of which more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion will be affected by Airbus," the parent company of the European EADS manufacturer said.
Due to the rise of these expenditures, EADS will have to submit new planned figures for its 2007 operating result on Thursday next, when it will report its quarterly results - the company added, but did not disclose any further figures.
The group also indicated that it had taken into account the six-month delay when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS’ operating performance decreased by 86%, largely due to the delay in the development of another program, the A380 giant, which also put a huge financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to hand over the A400M to the French military in October 2009.
Staying in the status quo
There is no big surprise in the Sunday elections: a large majority of Russians will vote for Putin’s head of state party, United Russia.
In this case, the need for stability for the Russians, to say the need for arbitrary governance, appears after a strongly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks in a televised message via public service channels to the electorate, which has already been recorded, but its content is still secret.
Putin leads the Kremlin-backed party, the list of candidates for the United Russia, which is expected to win a staggering victory in the elections.
When the foreign ambassadors received yesterday, the conduct of the head of state did not say anything: it was just another outcry against the interventions of Western countries, which was a favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know what the price of true democracy is, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections, without any violation of the law,” he added.
According to the opposition, however, this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign in which they say they have put pressure on the voters.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gennagyi Zjuganov, says that "there was never such a dirty election in Russia at the time of Yeltsin."
After the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garri Kaszparov was sentenced to five days in prison for an unauthorized demonstration, and his lawyer said he was still unable to attend.
"Russians are still thinking of 'homo sovieticus'"
The predictable election results raise two, even more obvious questions:
Who's following Putin in the chair of the head of state?
The date of the first round of the presidential election, which will be 2 March 2008, has been published in the Official Journal yesterday, and candidates can indicate their intentions to leave by 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his term of office is no longer extended.
But you don't have any other descendants in sight.
What role has Putin played since March?
You're going to be prime minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the president as the leader of the all-powerful United Russia party or the parliamentary majority?
Whatever the case, the leaving power is victorious in both the parliamentary and the presidential elections.
This has now become a tradition.
"Russians are still thinking about the way 'homo sovieticus': they don't feel like they can control their destiny," said Lev Gudkov, a sociologist, director of the independent Levada Centre.
Nicholas Koposzov, the historian of the University of St. Petersburg, goes even further: according to the theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later compared to Europe, so the development of civil society is also delayed.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin returned to the paternalist model, which was perfectly suited to the people. Even more so, since this new kind of paternalism was accompanied not by intimidation, but by some economic well-being" - thinks Maria Lip
Nowadays, the Russians "refused personal responsibility" from themselves, which quickly emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all layers of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the United Russia are led by 65 governors, who are drawn from the leaders of the 85 Russian region.
And freedom imported from the West is often embodied in chaos, as was the case in the 1990s.
The public has a preference for stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extremist parties.
Tamara Cherednychenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: “Why should we think?
Those in power are not so bad, why should we replace them?”
Depressing Memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive has become public, documenting the fate of the Hitler regime’s 17.5 million victims.
The 47 million archives, which cover 27 kilometres of shelves in Bad Arolsen, in the province of Hesse, have so far been searchable only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. only a unique and name-introducing opportunity has been offered to the victims or their descendants.
In May 2006, eleven countries dealing with the documentary - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed to open the archive for researchers and historians.
After all states have ratified the Convention, the archives were opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen documentary will allow historians to conduct research "on the relocation of detainees, on the residents of camps and on the health status of forced workers" - explains Reto Meistern, chairman of the Red Cross International Committee.
To date, several states, including Germany, have objected to the publication of the documents, as they contain names and thus confidential information.
Such may be the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims, for example.
The lists of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo began to be collected for practical reasons after the war. The aim was to search for civilians deported or sentenced to forced labor on the basis of these, and possibly to serve as evidence in their incarceration.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently engaged in the processing of tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archives of outstanding importance.
"These documents basically contain nothing new," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Berlin University of Technology in 2006.
The EU and India will sign a free trade agreement in 2008
The annual turnover of Indo-European bilateral trade is now close to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the free trade agreement in 2008, said Peter Mandelson, European Commissioner for Trade, and India's Minister for Trade Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers approved in April last year that the European Commission should initiate negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The EU now has 60 years of bilateral trade in Indo-European countries.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also India’s largest foreign investor, but India is the EU’s 9th most important trading partner, according to the European Commission’s figures.
Peter Mandelson said that “a free trade agreement could be economically stimulating for both parties” and “India could thus increase its presence in a flourishing market of 450 million people.”
The European Commission is the first or second importer of the ten most important products exported by India, and the European Commission is the first or second importer, which is the first European Commissioner, and the European Commission is the second European Commissioner. The two giants, Europe and Asia, are the first to replace each other with the first European Commission, which is the equivalent of "47 billion euros worth of products" and "10 billion euros worth of services" and "10 billion euros worth of services" is the European Commission, and Dan is the second to each.

Bank of England Offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 Billion to the Money Market for Five Weeks
The Bank of England wants to alleviate uncertainty about credit conditions, so it announced on Thursday that it will pump <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion into the money market, which it will do with a 5.75% baseline and a five-week run-off this time.
"We want to alleviate the concerns that the monetary market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we also want banks to plan their liquidity positions more securely for this period. This is why the bank's reserves in the market are not as low as 6 shares of the bank's reserves for this period.
According to the bank's announcement, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be marketed on December 6 at 12:15 local time. For the offer, the banknote base rate is valid and the repayment deadline is 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has been issuing cash for five weeks as part of an open market operation.
The runamide of such operations is usually a week.
In a press release from the Bank of England, he added that he was "ready to take further measures" in order for interbank loans to be aligned with the bank's central bank base.
The current interbank interest rate on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate was above the September 18 level, currently at 6.6%.
Since the start of the summer monetary crisis, the Bank of England has calculated significant penal interest rates on money market amounts, which has kept banks from making use of them.
According to the speech (which is only reinforced by the trend in the exchange rate of the pound against the euro) many would have been more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which could have been accessed at a more favourable rate and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC are unwilling to review the Socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and the Nouvelle Centre group on Thursday closed off from discussing the articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
The text discussed at the meeting by the Socialists included about ten measures, which were adopted by the National Office of the Socialist Party on Tuesday. These included, for example, a 50% increase in the age of employment supplements, the cost of relocation, and the change in operating conditions.
As the UMP and the NC 180:115 voted against the review of the articles, the discussion between the government and the opposition, which occasionally resulted in loud speeches, was finally half-distracted.
The head of the Socialist Delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, has announced that his group will re-submit all its proposals as part of the amendment to the amendment of the Financial Bill, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
There were a number of talks about the new Philadelphia music festival organised by C3 Presents, but now the event’s organizer and promoter company has announced that Melvin Benn will be organising a concert in New Jersey in collaboration with British producer Melvin Benn, the Festival Republic.
"It's an honor to be able to work with people who are the originator of today's American festival movement," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 hosts the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The New Jersey Vineland Festival is held in the summer, so there will be a way to tent.
Between August 8 and 10, the festival will be held in a private 500-moon space located about 40 minutes from a Philadelphia.
The director of the Festival Republic, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Melvin Benn is one of the world’s most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he started organizing the British Reading Festival, which attracts about 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn expanded his palette with the Leeds Festival, and in 2006, he launched the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been a co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival for production, licensing and organizational tasks. It is now able to accommodate up to 177,500 people.
C3 co-worker Charlie Jones called the Glastonbury Festival "the most inspiring event he's ever attended" and added that his company and Melvin Benn's company are working in parallel to make the region a European-style festival event.
"We've already selected the Philadelphia venue and we've worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Committee to arrange this in the heart of the Philadelphia Festival," said Charlie Jones.
"We have been negotiating with the city and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, however, due to the political maneuvers of the city management, the organization has failed,” continued Charlie Jones.
Fortunately, we were able to talk to Melvin Benn about it, and we are now preparing for a huge festival in another unique location that ultimately serves the interests of the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents re-established Lollapalooza in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after demonstrating its exceptional festival organizing skills at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross revenue of the two events in 2007 was <0x24>9.8 million and <0x24>11.3 million respectively.
Both festivals were held on the city’s premises.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals are usually held in urban green areas," said Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way, creating both the European rural atmosphere and the sense of urban life that is common in America."
Vineland is located approximately halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The people of Vineland, and even the mayor himself, are enthusiastic in support of the event,” said Charlie Jones.
While he does not talk about the details of the deal, he says that "the conditions are favorable enough to allow investment in such an event in a venue that hopefully will host the festival for a long time."
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be "original" in size, with a capacity of approximately 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
The members have already received an invitation to the event, but at the time of the press release, nothing has been finalized.
“Vineland is going to be basically a rock festival, but we’re planning a variety of music offerings so everyone can find their favorite,” said Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, together form the C3 company, which was awarded the "Best Independent Event Organizer" at the latest Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal against the Terminator.
It's not easy to seduce Hollywood directors to Montreal when you're faced with the Terminator...
The "seduction" is one of the missions of the Montreal mission.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" as California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes the rotation of his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to take on the fight with the "Terminator-Governor"?
“We have to be careful because the film industry itself decides which is the best place for us.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions on the basis of which they decide for us," Schwarzenegger said.
Competition for the Festivals
However, Denis Turcotte is now mostly focused on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars has begun.
The aim is to present and promote as many Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, whether it be the Sundance Film Festival or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival. It is also important to ensure that the directors hold hearings.
The film L'<0xC3><0x82>ge des Ténèbres received a welcome reception a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will also be held at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
The film Shake Hands with the Devil will be featured in Santa Monica and at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
In addition, Québec represented himself with four short films and four plays at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a rally at the stock exchange at the end of the year? Experts share the opinion of the "subprime" crisis
Almost five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their bucks and can’t wait to get their usual hair at the end of the year.
This year, however, it is not clear to the experts whether this will really happen.
According to Banif, "statistically, the stock market generally behaves positively in December.
But forecasts based solely on statistics are not necessarily correct, and in fact, uncertainty in the current situation characterizes the market, at least in the short term.”
Experts do not support the end of the stock market year, although they say that "the stock market maintains the presence of liquidity, it gives an opportunity to invest, as there are lacking alternatives to the value of the guarantee, as well as the effect of the return on the fixed yield."
According to them, the exchange will be characterised by a rather lateral movement without volatility, "especially because the impact of the Fed's rate reduction is unknown, because the price of crude oil is high and inflationary tensions are also threatening".
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain agrees with this, so he thinks it would be risky to declare that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, "the situation is not at all rosy."
Ibex lost almost 4 percent from its highest value on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts are so clumsy.
According to Intermoney analyst Juan Solana, the Ibex 35 could close the year to 16,000 points due to the reorganization of its wallets and payments to the regular pension fund at that time.
On the other hand, the expert adds that some change is expected this year, as the rally takes place on the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the Constitution Day.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, we are close to the technical level and “we can see a decline in the stock index, which may also rise depending on the news from the U.S. and the consequences of the credit market crisis.”
Analysts are confident that they will be successful.
Analysts agree on what will be securities aimed at achieving Ibex’s new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, emphasizes that "the line is on your big securities."
The expert would include the two major banks and some construction companies on the list, "because by now the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco said the increase was due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
The rally can also be positive for the construction companies, of course if it is at all.
“The ACS has been trying to regain positions for months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow along this path,” the expert said.
Cyclic consumption will be the main character for the remainder of the year due to the increase in sales experienced during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, tech companies can also go well, although in this area the representation in the Spanish market is not too high.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, the December exchange rate has only occurred twice.
The real year-end rally was observed in 2003, when the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the outbreak of technology bubbles.
This year, when Ibex 35 adjusted 28.17%, a 6.68% jump was recorded in December.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive year in a row (currently Ibex is showing 8.36% growth since January) and whether the final rally will take place.
Banco Popular Español 200 opens an account for 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Español has decided to renew most of its accounts.
This affects a total of 200 accounts in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and bring a big change to the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group, whose accounts are kept open continuously until 20.30 p.m. and even on Saturdays from 10 a.m. until 20.30 p.m.
The other group, the BBVA, which has also repeatedly stated that it plans to extend its account opening, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, a recent agreement has been made with the unions that it would close 75% of its accounts to open in exchange for an afternoon, although not for the public.
The experiences of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions, as it will be decided on this basis whether they will join the initiative to support a more favourable opening of stores.
This is the goal of the Banco Popular Español project.
I would like to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses who are shopping in these places.
The bank wants to operate 200 bank accounts throughout Spain for 18 months with the opening period already mentioned, as it is not a new opening order, but a transformation of the existing one.
For this purpose, the institution modernizes its accounts in the commercial areas according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening time is accompanied by a new concept of the nature of the drawers, a more modern, more colorful design.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, head of commercial banks, points out that the restructuring does not require much investment, but requires more employees, which means eight or nine employees per account instead of the current six.
Accounts, in which even negotiations for SMEs will be available, will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experiences
The initiative has already been implemented in three Madrid-based branches of Banco Popular Español.
According to Angel Rivero, the experiences were favorable.
In Madrid, Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell, and Gran Vía, the decision was right, according to Rivero.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2,500 accounts.
Another 60 operates under the name Mundocredit, specializes in immigrants, and has a very favorable opening schedule, even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax’s mentioned units do not use the BBVA model, where some accounts offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We don’t want to create competition for our customers,” Rivero said.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica and will be able to sell mobile phones using external staff.
Telecinco first doubles the value of its rival, Antena 3
"We did it."
With this statement yesterday, he expressed his satisfaction with the closing of the market by Paolo Vasile, Telecinco’s trusted advisor, when it became clear that his TV broadcaster had doubled the value of Antena 3.
One thing, however, haunted his joy: “It’s only the pain that this is not because we have risen more, but because we have less night,” he said.
Still, he put a lot of emphasis on the fact that in the weak market we are "less."
Telecinco closed with a 2.54 percent increase yesterday.
This increase sets the annual loss to 15.66%.
Mediaset owns 52 percent of the company, Vocento owns 13 percent, so its stock market value is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
Rivalisa, Antena 3, lost 1.52 percent yesterday and has recorded a 40.5 percent drop since January, reaching 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; 2.518.53 million for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is reflected in the similarity between the two companies.
The question is just how much we can do in the same market, at what costs, and how this all comes about in terms of visibility.
Telecinco announced last week that it wants to be the first TV channel to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, a senior advisor to Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising subsidiary.
If the reported fact is realized, the TV channel would increase revenues from advertising by 3.6 per cent compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 financial year this year.
Antena 3’s net turnover increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the financial year (at 734.4 million), while TV’s net revenue grew by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors that triggered Telecinco’s stock market momentum is the high payout that has been held so far: in 2006, it distributed 100% of the company’s revenue to its shareholders led by President Alejandro Echevarría.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this ratio could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol with its parent company, in association with Mediaset.
"Officially, we guarantee a minimum of 50% payout, although we've always allocated a lot more.
I hope our shareholders will be satisfied with us this year, as we have already favored them with the acquisition of 33% of Endemol.”
According to analysts, the market is currently characterized by some slump.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced Telecinco's revenue estimates by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
According to them, this can be attributed to the fact that the estimated increase in revenue from 10.5 per cent in 2008 to 8.4 per cent and from 5.5 per cent in 2009 to 5.1 per cent.
The same company predicts that Antena 3’s profits will decline by 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 reviews
Articles 1 and 2
Ibersecurities: It recommends buying both securities, mainly due to the high cost-effectiveness and long-term sustainability potential of the shares.
Article 2
Caja Madrid: Telecinco is more favourable (purchase) than Antena 3 (maintenance) because of its "multiple attractiveness" and business growth.
Article 3
JPMorgan: in both cases recommends underweighting due to "similar risks" (full market and unfavourable economic climate).
The Congress approves the adoption of MiFID on November 1st
In parallel with the parliamentary procedure - which concluded today with a congressional vote in favour of the amendments to the Senate - the government has initiated a social dialogue on the law-based regulation so that both can come into force even before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups unanimously highlighted the efforts of the representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements aimed at the development of the most favourable standards for investor protection, as well as the detailed regulation of the activities of companies.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, allows for the modernisation of monetary markets, while strengthening the protection of investors, extends the European Union’s special supervisory rights and promotions between the Spanish National Securities Markets Committee (CNMV).
The new directive will allow financial advisory services to companies, but also natural or legal persons, as well as securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management firms, to create a new one (as well as a new one) for the financial advisory services.
In addition, the law increases the number of systems suitable for the execution of operations involving funds, thus adding to the regulated secondary markets the multilateral trading platforms and the internalisation systems for the execution of the contracts, which are invaluable.
In addition, the Act requires investment service providers to be informed of the market on the decisive aspects of their business profile, risk taking and risk management methods, as well as on all the necessary records to facilitate the control of the CNMV.
The Economic Committee of Congress has tabled a number of amendments. Of these, it is of paramount importance that securitized debts are treated as a "complex" monetary asset, i.e. due to the high risk to the investor.
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive was also used to legally circumscribe the scope of the activity of persons with an economic and entrepreneurial degree, 30 years after the entry into force of the exclusively functioning of the economic sector in 1977.
The Senate has recommended the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as an intermediary agent who works for another account, does not need CNMV’s permission, and can distribute products or acquire customers for multiple investment firms at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index grew by 0.5 points in November and thus reached 4.1%.
This indicator, which is taken into account by Eurostat to calculate the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the trend in Spanish prices for November.
Its publication is in line with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data that is comparable to data from the United States, both in terms of its time and nature.
The calculation method for the preliminary indicator is the same as for the calculation of the Unified Price Index, but the statistical modelling method is different for the evaluation of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator number is purely informative and may therefore deviate from the final data to be made public on 14 December.
"The Consumer <0xC3><0x81>rindex continues to show relatively high value."
Pedro Solbes, one of the government’s vice-presidents and finance ministers, said that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was only “temporary”, but at the same time predicted that the price index would be expected to show a “relatively high” snowfall.
In the corridors of Parliament, Mr Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not really favorable", Spain's inflation rate within the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also added that the November month "has brought fewer surprises" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high growth.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the Minister of Economy said in a statement regarding the data released today.
Through Northern Rock, Virgin is set to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion in three years.
Northern Rock’s deposits have declined by more than 50% and are currently only <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 billion, 800 million) since it was in crisis in mid-September and had to collect urgent loans from the English National Bank.
At that time, the company had a record deposit of more than <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, which has gradually decreased over the past two and a half months due to loss of trust of its customers, despite the government promising a 100 percent guarantee to the bank until the crisis ended.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial and commercial name, Virgin Money. Virgin will have to earn about a quarter of the revenues of British banks over the next three years in order to get the remaining targets of <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion and <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion
In England, Richard Branson’s high-profile businessman has made known his intention to spend around <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (i.e. <0xC2><0xA3>70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve his goal.
Northern Rock this week raised the Virgin Consortium's offer as the best way to avoid bankruptcy. In addition to Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
Mayor of Totana Arrested for Suspected Corruption Case
Police arrested the mayor of the village of Totana (Népart) in the province of Murcia this morning, suspected of being involved in a city-run corruption scandal this week.
A secretary of the City Hall and the chief of police of the town were arrested outside Rata.
Former city councillor José Martínez Andreo took over in May as the head of the corruption network, Juan Morales, who, according to official bodies asked by the SER radio channel, could be the head of the party.
The police are investigating further in the city's offices, as well as in the City Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales's lawyer has also been investigated as the main suspect in the corruption scandal that erupted this week.
According to the SER radio station, Juan Morales’s lawyer was arrested when he was leaving Morales with documentation about corruption in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged fee that Morales received in return for signing an agreement with a Galician construction company to re-evaluate 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the nomination of the PSOE in Toledo and the parliamentary presidential officer if they win the election.
The former defense minister, José Bono, accepted the proposal of the prime minister and the general secretary of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE Toledo list to the next parliamentary elections and fill the parliamentary presidency if they are elected.
This was announced by the PSOE Secretary of the Organization, José Blanci, at a press conference and Bono himself confirmed it after a meeting with Zapatero at the party's federal headquarters this afternoon.
The Prime Minister justified the former prime minister's choice by saying that "we have to count the best" in politics, and Bono is "among the best".
He added that the Manchai politician would “probably” be the candidate for the Socialist Party’s presidential office if the Socialists win the upcoming elections.
Bono would take over the seat of current parliamentary President Manuel Marín, who announced on November 15 that he is not planning to run for the next elections and abandoning his political career in rather scientific circles then fighting against climate change.
The former prime minister has acknowledged that the prime minister has been constantly urging him to return to the political scene since he quit actively politicizing two years ago.
He added that since the voters were aware of who would become the Vice President of the Economy in the event of the Socialist victory, the party also wanted to inform them, in the "sign of transparency", who would become the President of the Parliament.
If Bono really fills the post, he wants Parliament to be a "scene of respect and not of insult or screaming" and more similar to the home of citizens.
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where it is impossible to talk quietly, and it has been that the Prime Minister's speech has been halved in the Senate 26 times."
At the same time, he honored current President Manuel Marín for his "excellent work", but did not want to make himself a president anymore so that his opponents would be considered "surprising".
Campaign for Climate
Since the climate change advocating movement is ruthlessly pursuing both those who are skeptical of their predictions and those who prefer political or social conflicts, it must be very strong.
He must also stand by a political leader like Prime Minister Zapatero, who says the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and declares that “we need to make a new agreement with our Earth.”
However, this remark raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its Government has contributed to the fact that Spain is at the forefront of non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention within the Union.
Who is responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is concerned, and why has the Government not tried to avoid it?
In addition, it should also be clear to the Spaniards what measures they intend to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits of the population must change, what level of individual and social energy savings should we expect, and what economic consequences will it have?
So who has to sacrifice and who has to pay to save our Earth?
But we have not and will not be given an explanation for these issues.
Exactly because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has brought about measures, the actual measures are always unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and costly for both companies and the public.
Even the PSOE’s gasoline refueling would have been so unpopular before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrew.
That is, we must save the Earth from nothing but propaganda texts, empty, real consequences, without passwords.
With conventions, committees, minutes, new offices.
With the agreement with the Earth, as the Prime Minister, who speaks so well in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, and even beautify the election assemblies and awakens tenderness within us.

Totana Mayor and Chief of Police Arrested for Suspected Corruption Case
The police have arrested the mayor of the city of Totana in Murcia, José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the secretary of the City Hall, and a hospitality businessman for his concerns about urban development.
The mayor was detained in his home and then transferred to the City Hall, where he currently resides with several police officers, many of whom are in charge of the City Development Council and the municipal organ responsible for the management of the Elephants and Residents.
The three arrests were preceded by six arrests in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia on Monday in connection with a case in which two hectares of agricultural land were reclassified to be built into a land for the purpose of allowing 4000 people to live in Galicia.
Two other persons have not yet been detained, but they are under investigation, according to the Court of Totana No. 1.
The first six people arrested were handed over to the court.
Former Totana mayor Juan Morales, an independent MP of the People's Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who is the owner of a property agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated, as is the current girlfriend of the former mayor, who lives in the center of Murcia province.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), together with the director of the company Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G.. The latter company is also part of the Nuaria Group.
The investigation is carried out by a group responsible for crimes committed at the municipal level of the Central Operating Unit of the Police, whose members carried out 11 house investigations outside the arrests, mainly in connection with the detainees, in Mudzíd, in Rozgo, and in the company of Las Vegas.
In Totana, only one person was arrested: the owner of a well-known poultry company in the area, who was able to play an intermediary role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in the city of Totana, for which 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels were built.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of area in Totana, which was reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the currently 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Vigo, Venezuela, which is responsible for managing the streets of Coruna, Venezuela and the parking lot of the Catholic Ferdinand Square, Conycase, which specializes in direct marketing.

Articles 1 and 2
If you agree, let’s skip the Book of the Month a little bit and see if we can master some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already equipped it with a shovel.
People, life is constantly changing.
Of course, everyone can figure something out for themselves.
Article 2
Our Finnish rapporteur found this comment in one of Finland’s largest newspapers: (probably at the head of the PISA report on the world’s productivity), in Helsinki Sanomat, referring to what was published in conjunction with Blackburn’s book Kritik on November 18.
"The philosophical teachings were brought to the public after the tragedy of Jokela High School.
He quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche in his letters to a student who was in high school.
Pekka Elo, Educational Counselor in charge of teaching philosophy, on the pages of the Helsinki Sanomat newspaper, demanded that teachers examine Plato’s teachings with a critical eye, and then added that Nietzsche’s knowledge is not necessarily an essential elementary school teacher.”
Article 3
One of his colleagues informs us that the Penal Code contains an offence relating to Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is considered a crime and can be punished for a period of six months to a year.
However, if you steal a record worth less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 in a store, it is only a violation of the rules (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 in a store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty still does not reach the penalty for online downloading (Article 234 of the TFEU).
C. If you steal a car but take it back after 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the penalty rate for online downloading (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect less punishment if you get involved in a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you are involved in a mass shooting, you may be punished with a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 BTK) and a penalty of six months to two years for copying the CD.
(BTK Article 270).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. The sale of copyrighted films without the consent of the authors is punishable more severely than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague is right, someone's got a lot of things out of their hands.
Article 4
My doctor gave me a strange research article titled, “Money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less of it.”
That is, the feelings of the employees on the day of pay depend on how much the others received.
The experiment was conducted by measuring magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in Science’s latest issue.
Bernd Webern, the author of the study and head of the Neurocognition group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, said: “We measured the strongest activity when the participant responded correctly and his partner was wrong.”
The researchers found that if both were given the right answer and received the same amount of money, the brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received the double amount, the activity also increased.
I have no idea why it took so much science for such a simple conclusion.
Attorney General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting the Balkan war criminals in The Hague for eight years and from the Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court investigating crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
The mandate ends at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a bit of bitterness, as those responsible for the Srebrenica massacre of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, namely General Ratko Mladic and the Serbian Bosnian leader Radován Karadzic, are free.
Their names are on the list of directors selected by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach for the title of his documentary: Carla's List (2006, Spain) which has not yet been featured). The film is followed by a Swiss prosecutor-general from New York to Belgrade.
What kind of insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance, which means security, brings significant expenses against the various damages of the owner of the car and also depends on several factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining the license, family status, identification of the vehicle, and insurance coverage.
Buying a car is just the first step.
Choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car you want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract, stating that the insurance company undertakes compensation in the light of the fixed insurance fee in the event of the incident.
The insurance fee is practically the amount paid for the insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, gender, date of obtaining the licence, family status, type of car to be insured, its use, and the same.
Insurers shall determine the insurance fee based on the statistics, i.e. the higher the amount of the person who has a higher risk of accidents.
That’s why women over the age of 25 or women pay less, because according to statistics, they’re at a lower risk because they’re more cautious.
Similarly, on the basis of the findings, the insurance companies have concluded that those who are married cause fewer accidents than those who are single.
For the type of use of the car, the frequency is crucial.
With more frequent use, there is an increased chance of an accident occurring.
In determining the insurance premium, a number of factors are taken into account by insurance companies.
Therefore, the owner should carefully look for it to be able to choose the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we present the most important factors in your choice, so that you can best adapt to the needs of the insured and create an acceptable price.
When entering into an insurance contract, those under 25 years of age must have a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and freshness of the license.
Although the most ideal is to be insured against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
More cautious drivers can get complete self-insurance, which means they will be insured against all dangers and the price will be affordable.
With this type of contract, the insured will pay a part of the damage.
“The amount of self-insurance paid by the insured depends on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the self-insurance,” says Luis Noguera, Spain’s head of First Europe, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended liability insurance for third parties when the customer is insured against the damage caused to others, but not against the damage incurred in his own car.
In addition, it will also be secured against theft, firefighting and loss of the car.
It's a good advice.
If you are not yet 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents, as this affects the bonus and thus you can reduce the amounts to be paid in the future.
A bonus is the discounts provided to the insurance company's base rate.
The penalties imposed against the basic tariff are referred to as malus.
"The amount of the bonus and cash depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company had a good year, you can afford to raise the bonus rate,” Noguera explains.
If you have already exceeded the age limit of 25 years, it is easier for owners to undertake adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience gained over the years.
Then we advise you to make a complete insurance with self-sustainment.
"In general, young people are not able to properly apply their experiences in any accident, even when driving," says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the driver is already driving.
If the insured is already married but has not yet had children, it is best to take full insurance, of course, if your financial options allow it.
The insurance companies consider the child couples to be the clients with the lowest risk, so in their case the fee to be paid is also lower.
In this case, it is best to have a full insurance policy (it can reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300) or if you have a higher bonus, you can extend the insurance to the other person from the third year of the vehicle.
“They drive more calmly, at the same time they have greater purchasing power and can afford to have higher self-esteem,” said Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, we recommend full insurance with self-sustainment (which is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150), or in case of a higher bonus, it can also be extended to liability insurance.
Car insurance is very important, not only because it is a protection for the owner in the event of damage, but also because it is a big expense, so it is essential to choose the appropriate form of personalized insurance.
He wants to get a Celtic point in Milan to make it to the top eight.
Milan and Celtic on Tuesday measure their strength at the San Siro Stadium to win the missing point at the closing of the Champions League. With this, the Italians can be the first and the Scots can qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and in the fifth round they have been given the continuation with an indecisive one with Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but one more is needed in order for the six-pointed Shakhtar, who will fight the four-pointed Benfica, to not precede him.
Group D's two matches will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play in Japan at the Club World Championships, where on the 13th he will try to fight for the continuation to the 16th decisive.
With this group D finishing sooner than the others, and while the most likely result at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will be indecisive, the two teams are striving to win, as the Italians do not want to stay at home, and the Celtic can start from a better place.
The defeat of Gordon Strachan is enough to qualify if Shakhtar doesn’t win, but you can’t be sure of it, because if there’s a point equality, the Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won the next round (2-0).
The Italians will try to beat the night of the Scots, who want to join the reorganized Champions League eight times in a row, after having just won a goal from the Kaká in the previous season (1-0 indecisive tie).
Shakhtar would be most pleased with Rossonerik's victory because if he loses Celtic, he'll be in the 8th place and remain in UEFA.
Since Benfica, despite being on the last place at the moment and having no chance of remaining in the European Championship, can still get third place with a win to play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls started their tour in Vancouver, Canada, with 20,000 spectators performing for the first time since they split up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) before the Vancouver GM Place concert.
Approximately 20,000 people exchanged tickets to attend the concert, where they also featured a video film about the collective story of huge successes in the 1990s.
With the reunion and the tour at the same time, EMI released a new album in Spain, featuring major hits and two new songs including "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls from her husband's "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham, went on stage in a bracelet.
The athlete was also there in the crowded GM Place spectators, although a few days earlier Victoria banned him.
Victoria Beckham said the British football star "hasn't seen our dress yet, so I'm nervous about what he thinks of the performance."
'Sporty Spice', was the reason the band split up two years after leaving the band in 1998 "because the members didn't understand each other". He also seemed nervous during the press conference, which lasted two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings for the Spice Girls had changed.
I thought why not? Now I'm happy that I made that decision," Chisholm said of the group, which separated nine years earlier.
The singer added that over time, "things have been arranged and we love each other very much."
But a lot of things have changed since the Spice Girls last appeared in 1998.
According to CTV, Virgin Airlines arrived in Vancouver on its private jet.
There was a babysitter waiting for them at the airport.
Five of them have a total of seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the team performed in California (USA), followed by San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
The event will take place in Madrid on 23 December.
More fears about the Russian-Ukrainian gas crisis
The gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia has been renewed, which could also affect Russian fuel to be shipped to Western Europe.
The vast majority of Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transmitted through Ukraine and the dispute between the two nations is always attracted a lot of attention.
Kiev said that if Moscow raises the gas pipeline to be paid by the Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia at higher transit costs.
As a result of a previous debate between the two countries last year, the supply to the EU countries has been reduced.
The last debate between Kiev and Moscow was about the attempted agreement between the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, on the level of gas tax payable by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom said that it would have to implement a 50 per cent increase in the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008 with regard to the gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of shipments from Gazprom to Ukraine.
"It is important that we argue during the negotiations in accordance with one of the most important transit gas-providing states," Ukraine's economic minister, Anatoly Kinah, told Reuters.
"Changes in gas emissions should be linked, of course, to our ongoing debate on the level of costs of transit in Ukraine (and to Western Europe).
As a result of the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas pipeline leading to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino-like decline in exports to Western Europe, which at the same time greatly increased prices.
A quarter of the European Union’s gas supply is made up of Russian gas.
Russia has the largest reserves of natural gas in the world, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom will supplement its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
The NHS "is obliged to monitor foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS committees need to improve the control of the criminal records of workers coming from outside Europe, a supervisory body said.
The proposal was made by chief accountant Robert Black after a doctor of foreign nationality was linked to the attack on Glasgow Airport in June in Scotland.
Black also expressed concern that the NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of overseas workers.
At the same time, the report - through a sample of five health authorities - also pointed to key checks carried out properly.
Following the attack on the Glasgow airport, the headliner checked the list of employees recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jipe crashed at the building’s main terminal.
Abdullah was one of three doctors who were interviewed by the Old Bailey Court on charges of car bombing attempts in the UK in October.
In the case of their employees coming from overseas countries, the NHS committees must verify the qualifications and experience of the workers concerned before starting employment, as well as the necessary permissions for working in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Committees use Disclosure Scotland to verify the criminal record, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the territory of the United Kingdom.
Among other things, the accounting officer’s report proposed that the committees introduce the Criminal Records Office’s Guide, which facilitates for the employer the controls carried out with different overseas countries.
"While we have found evidence of such checks in the staff records, they are not carried out on a regular basis," the report said.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS is performing its own pre-employment review procedure at a high level, adding: "Our report highlights the areas of the system that can be developed in order to keep us informed about the number of NHS overseas staff."
According to Dr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, it is “extremely unrealistic” to use pre-employment checks to identify potential NHS employees who may commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report says that the pre-employment checks currently in place are working well in the NHS Scotland and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent,” he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the current number of overseas staff consisting of doctors and nurses is 1161.
However, the head accountant drew attention to the fact that the figures are likely to be higher, which is partly due to the fact that it is a problem for the committees to identify employees on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Arran area, in the Grampian area, in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, in Lanarkshire and in the NHS authorities in Lothian are highly coordinated.
These procedures were used to verify the passport, the work permit and the certificates of proficiency.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the guidelines and guidelines for the pre-employment checks of NHS employees from overseas countries.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a great pleasure to have been able to carry out this task following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the entire staff member's staff - including those who are employed overseas - will be employed on a day-to-day basis.

Saudi Arabia detains 208 people in connection with terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia yesterday announced that 208 militants involved in terrorist cells have been detained, planning an imminent attack on an oil refinery, as well as the execution of a collision involving several church personnel and security forces.
According to state television, one of the world’s largest oil exporters wanted to smuggle rockets.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the 2003 Iraqi invasion.
According to television reports, eight cells headed by a resident of a foreign national in the eastern province are planned to launch an attack on an oil facility.
After an attack attempt by Al-Qaeda in 2006 against the world’s largest oil-processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia began building a rapid-reaction force of 35,000 people to protect the facilities.
According to the Interior Minister, 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a "missile shooter" who crosses the country illegally.
The report also reported that the warriors tried to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom.
Twenty-two of the detainees are planning to commit attacks against church leaders and security forces.
The government has called for stronger action on the church leaders to curb the Saudis joining al-Qaeda fighters in Iraq, who are fighting against the Allied forces and the U.S.-backed Muslim government of Erevan.
Al-Qaeda fighters see a significant proportion of the Saudi church leaders as being engaging by the authorities in the support of the government’s royal family policy.
The militants of the organization - excited by the Saudi-born leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's call to target the Western-Saudi government - targeted the attack on foreign-inhabited settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
"The security forces have made tremendous efforts over the past five months," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told state television.
During the arrests, a 16-medium cell was also captured in Medina, aimed at spreading "takfirist thought."Takfirist thought is an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which is opposed to disbelievers and disbelievers.
Among the detainees were also 32 people who were accused of financial support from the militants.
The climate of Venus may provide a glimpse of the future of the Earth
Yesterday, scientists found that Venus was once able to provide pleasant living conditions.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggests that this planet is much more likely to be regarded as the Earth’s terrible twin brother than we previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbour of Earth.
The size of the two planets is almost the same and their orbit is similar, although Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now know that, billions of years ago, very similar living conditions could have prevailed on Venus and even habitable conditions could have been given.
However, due to the extremely high carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion caused by sunlight and the planet’s lower rotational speed, Venus has entered a different trajectory of development.
Today, water has evaporated from the planet, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt the lead, as well as hurricane-powered winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe - based on a year-long study of the planet - paint an exemplary picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes can develop on Earth.
Fred Taylor, a professor at the Faculty of Physics at the University of Oxford, who is also one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “Begin to wonder why the Venus climate is so far removed from the Earth as it is, despite the fact that it is a coincidence that the planet is so large.
"With the help of our new data, it was possible to develop a scenario about the formation of Venus billions of years ago, when it could still have Earth-like habitable conditions.
"Depleted uranium" seized by police
A kilogram of radioactive material - reportedly enriched uranium - was seized yesterday by Slovaks and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesman, three people were detained and the material was investigated.
The spokesman did not confirm whether it was uranium enriched, but said the material could have been sold for <0x24>1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Open doors wide open
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
Republican candidates in the presidential election, however, agreed to take part in a debate broadcast on YouTube, during which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions posed on Wednesday night turned out to be as ridiculous as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube-streamed debate.
However, this time the questions and answers well reflected the position of the Republican party approaching next year’s election.
It is not known at this time whether the CNN production managers who co-financed the debate have selected exactly what the YouTube clips were distributed to the candidates.
The longest issue of the first half-hour of the debate was immigration.
This is one of the Republicans' slippery slopes.
CNN called on some uncertain voters to cite a number if it sounds awkward to them: the mediator experienced an outstanding consensus when the candidates made a hard statement about the boundary issue.
The most intense and long-standing debate was between nationally leading Rudy Giuliani and Romney, who was the lead in the crucial pre-elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to change the image he has created of him, saying he handled the issue of illegal immigration too easily during his New York City mayorship.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house, the former governor of Massachusetts.
The dictionary between the two became particularly heavier when questioners asked about the support of "amnesty" (which would provide permanent status and the possibility of citizenship for illegal immigrants).
Some candidates with fewer votes - such as Duncan Hunter from California and Tom Tancredo from Colorado - have managed to deepen the subject.
And while none of them counts as odds at the nomination, their stay on the race track may be explained by the fact that they started to cling to the immigration rush earlier and louder than the others.
At least there is a broad consensus among the candidates on the issue of immigration: a common goal of strengthening borders and a strong action against illegal immigrants.
This theme - as well as the fear of Chinese toxic toys and other disturbing factors coming from the outside world - helps Republicans within the berkeins to forget or minimize the division between Libertarians and Christian conservatives.
However, when other topics were raised, the debate was very unpleasantly distorted.
Giuliani had to deal with the question of why he had previously supported gun control.
John McCain and Romney debated whether the simulated water deprivation was considered torture.
Another questioner was wondering whether the candidates believed all of the Bible’s words.
In this questionnaire, Giuliani was finally caught up in the view that although his favorite book was the Bible, the story of Jonah and the whale might not literally be interpreted.
Another question arose as to whether Jesus would endorse the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who won the first place in the Iowa election that had just taken place - who could have won thanks to his constant Christian conservatism - responded to expectations that the death penalty was painful but needed.
When asked if Jesus would get enough support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than going to the polls.
The competition is still unusually open.
Huckabee's vibrant rise in Iowa coincides with the campaign of libertarian Ron Paul to raise money and the energetic breathing of Wednesday's debate.
The sudden advancement of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet managed to initiate a joint candidate among the most known and traditional aspirants.
In the 1980s and 2000s, there was a candidate who united the party, who in time and convincingly sparked a message of victory proclaiming the greatness of America, and who found the common voice with both of the parties' wings.
Now, however, the party has been divided, and the consequences of this are unprecedented.
Labour Party Pain
Another gap in the bag before Gordon Brown; the exit path unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, it does not seem to be too picnic today.
No one has sold his honour, no politician has been given his hotel bills in Paris, and no one has committed any extramarital scandal.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman had contributed more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 (<0x24>1.3 million) to the Labour Party governing the United Kingdom for more than four years under the name of others, and that the party had not made a good report about it, without giving a good account of it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister cancelled the election, and when his statement - that public opinion surveys did not influence the outcome of the decision - unthinkably questioned the intellectual abilities of the British people, if they were still in a state of hope, they were still in a state of hope.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly spiritual deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, noted, the once frightened Brown Stalin transformed into Mr. Bean.
The move to rescue a forced bank, called Northern Rock, has put the regulatory weaknesses and inadequacies in the judiciary at a crossroads.
The patient proposals to amend the tax law have encouraged business interest groups to join the government as a whole.
The loss of the personal data of 25 million people by the tax authorities has revealed an unimaginably high level of administrative inadequacy.
In the House of Lords, three retired generals who protested against the reduction in the army's budget, declared that the position of the Minister of Defence was part-time employment.
And now here are David Abraham’s mysterious donations; Peter Watt, the Labour Party’s secretary-general (formerly administrative leader) has resigned.
These accidents do not mean that Brown could not return on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach the point after which control becomes impossible.
People don’t like politicians and don’t trust them, but they usually suspend their infidelity when a new group comes to power.
However, as soon as it becomes clear that the prime minister is highly unlikely to be able to prescribe things, and may not even remain in his post for a long time, the suspended disbelief will end: the public school will begin to dissipate; the public school will begin to dissipate, the offices and the cabinets will begin to dissipate.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation, as unlike other political leaders, he does not consider himself to be "fresh blood."
No matter how much he wanted to deny his relationship with Tony Blair, he was still his right hand.
Problems with Northern Rock and tax records are linked, for example, to decisions made by Brown at the time of the Treasury.
And while Blair’s kind of leftists – such as the protracted investigation of the relationship between “nobility for money” and political party funding – were not directly involved, voters can rightly assume the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it seems.
The shootings are not as frightening as those indicated by the torch.
As with Mr. Bean, no one was killed, no one was taken directly to him.
Compensation – no matter how painful it may be – could be the directions promised by Stalin in Brown: a reliable, solid and somewhat hard-working government.
A good example is the coolness around political donation.
The Garboian cellist Abrahams, who compared his donation to charity, stated that he did not want to reveal his goodness to the public.
Perhaps so, but the decision was not in his power to make it.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of large political supporters is clear and clear: the population has the right to know who knocks at the door of the country’s rulers.
Watt, who, according to his own account, was unaware of Abrahams’s illegal nature, would certainly be suffocated during interrogations; as well as Jon Medleson, the founding director of the Labour Party, who is in October for his death.
At the moment, however, the threads are not leading to Brown: there is no indication that he knew about these bills, not even that the huge sums were paid after Brown entered the office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has completed half of his duties.
He condemned the violation of the law committed by his party very soon, but strengthened his firmness that he had made a known instrument; by examining the case - for the sake of security - he commissioned a retired bishop and a magistrate to lead the case.
In this story, the "lessons to be learned" is not too complicated.
In the event of a violation of the law, the police are responsible.
In addition, Mr Brown has to deal with other issues, such as the appointment of the chairman of an independent committee that has been working without a leader for six months, negotiating administrative rules, or a preview of effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard-working Labour Party to cooperate with the Tori and to break up with special financial ties to associations - this would already be a hard wall for the party Brown.
But you should face some facts about the party.
According to the surveys, conservatives are currently leading a serious advantage; Brown has two years to recapture voters behind him; the only way to win is by unquestionable integrity and strong competence.
Card Sharks
Is the Secondary Market Loan Market Crisis Threatening the American Credit Card Market?
When blood is poured into the water, it is natural that sharks appear in the vicinity.
Now that the U.S. housing market is weakening, predators are focusing on the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of public loans, the loss of the credit card market could reach up to <0x24>99 billion.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the descriptive rate indicating the rate of unpaid loans and the rate of default indicating the rate of late payments over 30 days have been increased.
HSBC reported <0x24>1.4 billion in losses in the U.S. consumer financing segment last month, partly due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
At the same time, panic is still early.
The ratio of descriptions and late payments remains low.
The Moody’s credit rating agency’s late payment rate for the third quarter was 3.89%, a total percentage point lower than the historical average.
The reduction in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
The amendment of the U.S. rules of individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of insolvency notifiers, but at the same time in a large loss in the credit card market; the insolvency or insolvency of the bankruptcy claims (and this)
The payment rate, which shows the rate of monthly credit cancellation of consumers, is also solid in the market.
In addition, the confidence in securities covered by the credit card is also quite strong, despite the disparity in other areas of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup’s research firm estimates that the 2007 emissions volume will be 25% higher than last year.
Signs of the impact of the mortgage market crisis are clear on the credit card market: consumers are increasing debt on credit cards to eliminate housing.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor money movement rather than asset value, so the fall in housing does not necessarily cause a change in creditworthiness of creditors.
The situation may also be advantageous for the creditors.
If the property is less than the loan value, the incentive for consumers to cancel the loan decreases; as a result, repayment of debts on credit cards is a step forward in the priority rank.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt faster and more flexibly than mortgage lenders to changing conditions.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of a sudden recurrence of assets.
“It’s unlikely that one day we’ll wake up to fully re-evaluating credits,” said Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis is less likely in the credit card market, the risk of a gradual decline is much more likely.
If the declining housing prices and the decline in credit drive America into a recession, the industry is undoubtedly looking forward to a dreadful future.
It is worth watching for those predators.
British bankers have found themselves guilty in the Enron case
On Wednesday, the three British bankers who were brought to court to investigate their role in the fraud under Enron’s former financial director, Andrew Faston, pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were initially convicted of seven-week fraud allegations that they allegedly co-operated with Fastow in a secret fraud committed in 2000, which they wanted at the expense of their employer.
Their trials began in January.
But in a court hearing, U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. confessed to the crime he committed in a single-order fraud.
Three former employees of the Greenwich NatWest department of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group became known in the UK during the two-year extradition procedure.
The closing of the investigation into the case initiated after the collapse of Enron in 2001 is still waiting for itself in the United States.
The first indictment against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron’s bankruptcy.
The three brokers named the "NatWest Three" were charged with travelling to Houston in 2000 in order to prepare the scam with Fastow and Michael Kopper, the then-right-hand figure of Fastow.
Fastow, who was responsible for planning a number of bankruptcy frauds, also managed the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of its shareholding in the subsidiary, but the three British men knew very well that the interest was very high.
A company run by Kopper bought the bank's <0x24>1 million shareholding in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid <0x24>250,000 to Kopper to get a stake in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely informed Enront that the energy company was buying a <0x24>20 million subsidiary from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, the <0x24>20 million was hit by British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the prosecution, the bankers reached <0x24>7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others reached <0x24>12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed his two-way crime for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British three were detained three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper was sentenced to three years and one month in a Texarkana prison.
The three English men per capita were allowed to travel to the United States, where they were staying for a period of one million dollars.
Enron, the seventh-largest U.S. company ever, reported bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks were no longer able to cover the millions accumulated as debt and the losses actually reported to the profiteer.
As a result of the collapse, thousands of jobs have disappeared, the market value has fallen by more than <0x24>60 billion, and the value of pension funds has fallen by more than <0x24>2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron, and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, were convicted last year for their criminality in the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving more than 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud, and other allegations brought against Lay ended with the man's death last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow.
Starting at <0x24>54 million, a Gulfstream G550 with a Rolls-Royce engine will make the route between Moscow and Los Angeles without interruption with a tank.
But for some Russian wealthy, this amount is only considered small money.
"Eighteen passengers are on board," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream spokesman.
"But no one is ordering so many meetings because the machines are bought for private families or corporate executives."
Mr. Firer was waiting for the visitors at the four-day, exclusive, Milliomosok Vasar, which was organized in a huge exhibition hall in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury bag carriers have rented stands at the exhibition, hoping that Russian newcomers will be interested in everything from mahogany-covered yachts to diamond-covered refrigerators of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully watched the bright orange Porsche displayed on the stand next to him.
"It's a nice car, but our products don't get in the way," he said.
“Private aircraft have the largest market in Russia after the United States.”
The Russian capital seems to be floating in the money like Dallas did in the light of the oil explosion.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s, when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were considered material here," said Marshall Goldman, Senior Professor of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like Saudis in the 1970s and Japanese gamblers in the 1990s, Russians have now become the most spectacular spenders in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands demand their share of the gold lace.
At another conference organised by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, shared their opinion on how to sell high-value products in markets similar to Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes’ list of the richest people in Russia, there are 53 billion people with a total of <0x24>282 billion.
In addition, the number of Russian second-class millionaires reaches 103,000, who may have a total of <0x24>670 billion, as determined by a personal well-being analysis conducted in the former Soviet Union, the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(According to the World Bank data, in 2005 there were 15.8 percent of the minimum living population in Russia.)
"Hundreds of millionaires live in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a spokeswoman for Jewelry Sales and Marketing at the David Morris Jewelry Store in London.
For the first time, Nicole participated in the fair with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are treated with impeccable care, and men are a real treasure trove."
Two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, were allocated to millionaires both in the rooms on Sunday evening.
“I’ve seen the cars and I’m trying to make a decision between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said young Yumatova, who wore a blurred, unique design dress, as if he was already used to it.
The fair was primarily organized for the newly-rich, brand-oriented Russian customers who are willing to go around a wired, digitally decorated venue after several hours in circulation, where they can find apartments with duo, Cadillac Escaleds, mccs, platinum pockets.
The average entry fee is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 (<0x24>44.57).
"Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was home-grown at the Royal Delft stand, opposite a wall-sized hand-decorated, painted in blue in exchange for Rembrandt.
"The Russians, of course, are more interested in the obvious things."
Indeed, the sellers here said that long ago (according to the Russian standard, this means 10-15 years) the rich Russians have already passed from sparkling logos to brands made in a limited number of specimens that would not get into a wheel.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires, staff and tourists, were busy every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, on Thursday, Roman Ershov, the director of the King Koil beds company, said that on that day, he sold two mattresses, each of them worth <0x24>70,000, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with a gold lining.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, A1 Moto’s sales associate in the supply of high-end modern alarm cars, reported that the company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for <0x24>170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, L.A. Connection’s luxury car manufacturer, sold three cooling wheels to Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoons. The grids are similar to connected chain brackets and will cost up to 55 thousand per day.
Reporters were also presented with a wheel made for a Russian casino owner, who said Swarovski was wearing crystals to create the appearance of a roulette wheel.
The price of a set of four pieces: <0x24>22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of stratum leather and a picture of his wife's face from a circonium bag will not necessarily use these objects," said Karapetian.
"He's going to keep them in the garage with 30-40 cars."
Despite the fact that many of Russia’s customers are rich, according to Karapetian, the term “Russian millionaire” is not a great privilege today, given the rapid rise in real estate prices there.
"Those who bought a property in Moscow four or five years ago are most likely millionaires today, if not in cash, but at least on paper," he said.
"They're more than you think."
Those who weren’t millionaires could at least look like wealth in front of the stand of the Russian asset management company Alliance Continental.
The company has built four phone booths in the English style, which were piled up with millions of fake banks.
Azad Karriev, the company’s marketing manager, said the team printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires’ Cup.
Many of those visitors stopped to play with the money. Many took pictures of themselves on a mobile phone as they rubbed in the wallet, or just put a few million in their pockets.
"In Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karriev said.
Surgical Failure Suspected of Death in New Jersey
The day before the Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked out the window of the "Just a Little Healthier" restaurant and saw a ambulance stop on Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Not long later, a police patrol car arrived.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stopping," said Mr. Livingston, one of the restaurant's supervisors, on Wednesday.
"Then I knew that someone was dead."
Authorities have found out that the deceased woman, Olga Arroyo, is 41 years old. She used to work as a senior assistant to the Newark Police Director.
The investigation is currently underway to find out whether the death was caused by an unauthorized intervention by a cosmetic surgeon who worked under West Scott Avenue 212, not identified by the police.
Authorities have so far failed to find out what caused Arroya’s death, but they hope that the results of toxicology tests that will be available in a few weeks will shed light on this mysterious death, which has affected the rank of newarka with great pain.
Arroyo, whose voice has been known to many in the department, has worked as an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006.
"It was loyal, diligent and reliable," McCarthy Arroyo said in a phone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my housewife.
He was my protector.”
McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, formerly a Newark police officer, currently a member of the Commission for the Control of Seasonal Products, and left behind two, a 14-year-old and an 11-year-old boy, as well as a deceased daughter.
Eileen Walsh, Union Attorney General Theodore J. Romankow's spokesman said investigators were working to investigate whether Arroyo was the victim of the intervention of an unlicensed surgeon.
"It's like the probability," Walsh said.
"The investigation is still underway."
Reports from the authorities show that they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November.
On the 21st and Mrs. Arroyo was found on the couch.
They've already been declared dead on the spot.
It has been more than a week and the police have so far reported very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't talk about whether Castro had been heard by the detectives.
Participants in the study investigated whether part of the house functioned as a doctor.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Castro’s home, where a roaring rose was standing in the narrow courtyard and a Dalmatian was knocked out from the back of the house.
Next to the door leading to the basement, in the car entrance was a blue tank with the inscription "Ethil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes were hung from the foothills sideways.
When McCarthy arrived in Newark for the first time after 25 years at the New York police station, Arroyo offered her invaluable help by helping her connect with the new city’s unusual and unmistakable political culture.
"He always said, 'It's going to be better to take care of it!'" he recalled.
"He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was always inside when I left in the evening.
It was confusing."
Expectations for Fed interest rate cuts lead to global stock markets deteriorating
Shares on both sides of the Atlantic skyrocketed yesterday, after reassuring statements by the vice-president of the Central Bank of America raised hopes that the Fed will try to ease further interest cuts in investment opportunities.
Stock markets both in London and New York and across Europe have been frustrated after Donald Kohn, who has declared Fed President Ben Bernanke's right hand, has to react "flexibly and pragmatically" to the financial markets in a consistently unobserved manner.
In addition to Kohn’s clear intention to ease markets amid signs of a renewed credit crisis, he said the current unrest had “partly reversed the market’s development in late September and October.”
He said that if the increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on the credit conditions of households and companies.
The statements were interpreted by investors as the Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into the U.S. markets to stabilize credit conditions or even further interest rate cuts.
The statements also had a calming effect on Wall Street, which has recently received more bad news for the U.S. economy, such as the negative record for U.S. housing.
The side effects of financial unrest were also reinforced by the Bear Stearns Investment Bank’s announcement that, in order to counteract the losses in the U.S. secondary housing sector, 650 workers and 4 jobs globally were lost as part of the cost reduction.
The above measure affects a total of 20 jobs in the 1,500-employee London headquarters.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average grew by 331 points, 2.55 percent, and closed by 13.289.40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent, and closed by 6,306.2 points, increasing the value of British blue-chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax grew by 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 grew by 2.3 percent.
The credit market unrest has rebounded after a high-demand auction organised by the European Central Bank for three-month run-around securities reached the European banks at an unprecedented price of 4.7 percent since April 2001.
After the interbank interest rate, Libor reached its highest since September, 6.59 per cent, after a steady growth after November 12, the Bank of England has been under greater pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB's loan market.
England demands decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who should be the English team's six field in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the indirect context of the first test against Sri Lanka, it is no less important who makes the decision?
The latter question is of current importance, on the one hand, because David Graveney, the president of the polls, who is temporarily in charge of this particular task, will be assisted by the chief coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan in the decision.
Of the two players draw the shorter, which does not get the sixth battering place, but as is known, life, and especially the sport is often unfair.
It is never easy to say what makes someone reach the peak of their profession, while others can’t even pass it on a lower level. Often it depends on the luck rather than the talent.
It’s not just cricket that it’s difficult to choose – often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it true for Shah if this happens?
The same question can be raised in other areas of life, for example, if you say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, well-trained young business leaders who are well-known to the decision-makers, while there are only two of them.
Who can tell what level a cricketer is going to be without being thrown into the deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, the data has a big impact on the decision, but the options are equally important.
In a team, the player has to catch the captain’s gaze at the cricket gate at the right moment, and a kicker has to get a chance on a regular basis if he wants to become a big player.
It is much more difficult to catch the eye of the selectors.
For example, James Anderson has played better last season than many others, but he is certainly a member of the team in the first test, despite Stephen Harmison’s own saying that he is in good shape and that he is doing very well.
Anderson scored 32 first-class goals and 33 runs to take part in the tour.
Chris Tremlett only scored 29, but both of them have already had their moments of success at the highest level, and they hope to be like that in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium will be decided on the basis of the reviews.
This decision can boost or disrupt anyone’s career, but it can also have no special impact on the future.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every test and performed well with five goals and 40 useful runs, however, the then-started Paul Collingwood was the one who emerged as a cricketer, who may have been a cricketer, even now underestimated and underestimated.
It is likely that at their meeting at Asgiriya Stanion during today’s game, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will be listening to their conservative feelings, and Shah’s voice will be heard against the youthful vigor and dynamism of Bopara.
There are arguments on both sides.
Shah has made his bright and successful debut in the 88th Bombay test quarters, with Bopara, who was seven years younger than Bopara, a 22-year-old man who scored 32 first-class 100s in excellent screw throws.
But the fact that Middlesex player Shah was at home in May, in a test held in Lorda against the West Indies in two quarters, was only ten runs, and that Vaughan, who was fighting for him, was fighting for an immediate resistance from the teams and was battling him.
Against him, Essex’s universal talent is a life-giving and unsurpassed player.
The cricket track can not be interpreted with anything, but his out-of-court behavior was well-characterized when he was swooped up at an exhibition with a four-wheel drive for the team’s automaker, Volkswagen.
However, the first thing he did after that was to take in his (of course sponsored) Vodafone phone and call his remotely-watching teammate, Alastair Cook, and ask him, "What do you want to do?"
Bopara is a better player with classics. With his sliding middle steps, he creates an advantageous kicking angle, and his kicks are confident and skillful.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and another is the right moment.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
I would personally give Bopara a chance now, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah would provide an outstanding one if - as the tea records in Ceylon suggest - he was the one who played this weekend.
Refugees are being transported home by bus to work and fight Al-Qaeda
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria have arrived in Baghdad with those Iraqi refugees who have lost their money or expired their visas, or actually those who hope the city has regained order.
There are some among them who have come back to fight with the soldiers who have driven them out of their homes.
The bus station in Mansour was already crowded with refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy carrying dozens of buses from Damascus arrived.
“Then I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi’s Sunni doctor.
"Today I came back because I saw what happened in Baghdad on TV and in the newspapers and that the city is now safe.
"It is said that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he added, referring to the militia clergyman Moqtada al-Sadr, who has now stopped the ski army.
The 38-year-old ski teacher from Amariyah, mostly Sunni, Qassim al Atwani, returned home with his two children for failing to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqis from taking up work.
Neighbors of the Amarijai slope phoned him and urged him to return home, saying he managed to get al-Qaeda out of their base in the western part of the capital with American-backed troops.
One of the first to come from Jordan was a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader who fled a grenade attack from his home in northern Baghdad’s Sleikh after encouraging his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, my friends called and told me they had created an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and they needed the support of me and my sons.
That's why I came back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have been told that peace has been strengthened in the capital since the American troops were involved and that they have been seduced home by armed civilian forces working with the Americans.
But many more were forced to return from Damascus due to visa and financial problems.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old, voiced the widespread view among refugees that Nouri al-Maliki's ski prime minister had asked the Syrian government to refuse their visa application for refugees to be contacted by the Syrian government.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people have fled the death toll in the country.
"It was okay until al-Maliki made a visit to Syria and pressured the government not to issue more visas to Iraqis in order to move home," the Sunni retired man said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I ran away."
One of the reasons for the alleviation of the violence was that the Sunnis were expelled from the ski areas, while the skies were also removed from the areas of the Sunni population. As a result, tensions in many areas decreased.
Many fear that the sudden emergence of refugees will re-enrage the ships, which can lead to even more fighting.
Small Saarland - high-level training
The smallest federal province has a leading role in the field of vocational training, and its higher education is also internationally oriented.
Only in one area of training, the Saarlands are struggling with the same deficiencies as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, I explained fifty times outside a Saarland that we are not French," the self-proclaimed slogan's posters said on the occasion of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the Saarland education system, which, according to the surveys of the German Economic Institute (IW) in Cologne, is ranked fifth.
In this way, the institutions of higher education - because of their traditions alone - cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Students here can complete their studies with a double or even triple degree to date.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent high.
However, Saarland universities and universities in the Saar region are also more attractive than average for those who want to study - many of them do not have a high school degree.
"In the Saar region, the opportunities for vocational training are being exploited," explains Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the German Institute of Economics.
More than one-fifth of young people are eligible for further education in vocational training schools, making the Saar region more than seven percent higher than the federal average.
The combination of vocational and higher education options have also been well developed.
Infrastructure for dual studies ranks second in Germany in terms of population.
However, despite practice-oriented training and growing interest, the number of graduate engineers has declined by a third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education of the Saarland has therefore obliged the higher education institutions to pursue a marketing campaign that focuses on the engineering sciences.
"In general schools, we initiated a number of reforms following the first Pisa study," a spokesman for the Ministry of Education said.
Therefore, the government has put in place comparative tests nationwide.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of nursing is free of charge. This is a model that in the meantime also began to be copied in other federal provinces.
Whether students’ performance will continue to improve, only future comparative studies will be given an answer to this question.
Based on the 2003 Pisa survey, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
However, overall performance in the Saar region has not improved as much as in other federal territories.
The Bajors count better.
The greatest revenge in the Saarlands is not taken into account during the Pisa survey on foreign language proficiency - otherwise, they would be able to produce babers in this area,
because the language of neighbouring countries is mandatory in high schools - even if the Saarlands are not French.
Chávez turns the clock
In the near future, the clocks will work differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will turn the timers back in Latin America in half an hour.
In the meantime, Chávez became the subject of laughter in Spain.
According to the official Venezuelan newspaper, according to a new law, clocks are turned back by four and a half hours compared to the Greenwich time.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not in use in any other country in the world.
Chávez against the United States, among other things, justified his decision by forcing the entire hours-based time zones of the United States into the world.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday that relations with neighboring Colombia would be discontinued due to a hostage attack.
The left-wing nationalist politician said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he will not have any contact with the head of state or the government of Colombia.
"I can't do this because of my own dignity," Chávez said, calling for a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country must form an opinion within a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, it would significantly build power in the country.
The reason for the debate was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate to negotiate with Colombian Marxist rebels for the release of hostages.
Uribe, with his decision, "arc" Venezuela, voiced criticism by Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, everyone is talking about Chávez.
In the country, a new mobile ringtone has emerged: "Por qué no te callas" - that's how the phrase that more than half a million people have downloaded from the internet sounds.
The phrase comes from Juan Carlos, the king of Spain, who was so impressed at the recent Latin American summit by the constant mediation of the left-wing populist politician, that he cut it in such a way.
In 2007, Germans were threatened by wage cuts
A real wage decline is expected to threaten German workers this year despite a strong economic downturn.
Experts have supported their pessimistic predictions for a number of reasons.
According to the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, employees could actually expect less pay in 2007 than in the previous year.
“The reason for this modest wage development, the increase in general sales tax, as well as the rapid increase in food and energy prices,” said Gustav Horn, associate of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research.
In the case of unemployment insurance, additional burdens may also be borne by workers.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said in a statement to the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that in the current situation, the right and reasonable unemployment insurance would be reduced to 3.3 per cent at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult position as to go to the federation for loans or support, the German Social-Democratic Party, the SPD politician, was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it became known that the collapse of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
Compared to the year, prices increased by a total of 3 per cent.
Venus is the devil's brother-in-law of the Earth
Despite the atmosphere of Venus, it is more similar to Earth than previously thought: in its atmosphere, the European "Venus Express" spacecraft detected lightning flashes, and in its corners, such as the meteorites that occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus is flashing.
The European "Venus Express" spacecraft has provided evidence - it has discovered electromagnetic waves on the perimeter of the atmosphere: Lightnings occurring on Venus extend from clouds to clouds at a height of 56 kilometres, reports the journal "Nature".
According to the famous "famous theory" the formation of Earth life was caused by lightning: According to the theory, the sycamores initiated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
“If life ever existed there, it could have been in very early times,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute of Washington.
At present, there can hardly be a living organism on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere around the circle is a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the hell of the earth, but it's still the hell of the earth," Russell said.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus is so similar in the mass and size of the Earth as it moves on a completely different path of development.
The launch of the "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of Venus, because since the early 1990s, no probe has been on its way to exploring this planet.
The latest research findings presented in several "Nature" articles, according to the researchers, prove not only the uniqueness of the Venus system.
"They also indicate that the neighboring planet's similarity to Earth is greater than we first assumed," Esa said.
Researchers have also discovered an even faster moving cloud turbine on the South Strait, in addition to the already known North Strait wind.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air flows in the Earth's winter hemisphere, according to a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spatiale e Physics Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the Solar System is almost the same mass as Earth, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers and almost the size of Earth.
The sun, also known as the Dawn Star, orbits the Sun in less than 225 days.
However, it is much slower to rotate around its own belly: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although the surface temperature of Venus, which evaporates at 92 bars, reminds us little of Earth, the scientists believe that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
Both of them accumulated water, which remained on Earth by the ocean, while on Venus it departed into the universe.
And while carbon dioxide is bonded in carbonate rocks on Earth, it is a major part of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Köhler, the President of the German Republic, is calling for the end of the debate between the parties, which exploded around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor’s office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after the September reception.
German Republican President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s sovereignty and called for a major coalition to end the debate about accepting the Dalai Lama.
"In this issue, we should not appear to the outside world as a divided nation," Köhler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
Köhler also expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) welcomed the Dalai Lama in September.
“Human rights are universally valid for me even if I respect the differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone is aware that Germany must take care of the foreign-politically delicate balance, the president stressed; however, Merkel defended against the accusation that the chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not broken up with the traditional ‘one China’ policy.
China is also aware of this,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly voiced his displeasure over the reception of the Dalai Lama, making it the target of attacks in the EU ranks.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's "crack policy" in the field of foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor’s office, there have been serious disturbances in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese government not only rejected the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two countries, according to SPIEGEL.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now called on federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that it was a mistake to accept the Dalai Lama.
China rejects the official reception of the Tibetan religious leader by European politicians, confirming the Chinese position of Wen Jiabao.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama have pointed out that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan territories from China today.
Schäuble protects against disturbances similar to those of France
Street fires with the police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects against disturbances similar to those in France.
“Everything must be done to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from falling into street violence,” the Federal Interior Minister said.
Barricades have been set on fire, snipers have been shot at the police with a beer rifle: after the severe disturbances of the young people in France, the Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is holding back from similar developments in Germany.
“We need to make sure that social explosives don’t accumulate in us and don’t engage in violence.
We need to take the matter seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" newspaper in Hannover.
Not all young people adapt to the rapid changes in social reality.
Alliance, provinces and communities are currently working intensively on solving problematic cases, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes are only shown.”
However, it is still too early to resolve the emergency.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the German suburbs do not have urban architectural and sociological problems as in France.
In the northern outskirts of Paris last night, the youths have been in serious street fights with the police.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
Taking all this into account, Kenan Kolat, the head of the Turkish Communities in Germany, demanded greater activity in the field of integration from the federal government.
In France, Kolat warned of the "dangers of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
However, action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families, the unemployment rate is "higher than the average".
First and foremost, more educational spaces should be provided.
Kolat stressed: “We need to provide perspectives for young people.”
The head of the Turkish Community, however, added that "social supervision within the family" is much more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from an immigrant family do not want to ruin what their parents built up here.
Kolat warns: "However, we have to be patient."
"Young people should be given the opportunity to have a job and to receive education as quickly as possible."
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel, there was complete tranquility overnight.
Hundreds of policemen were ready to deploy, and a helicopter paved the area with a flashlight.
Competent authorities have reported three arrests, as well as some incendiary garbage dumps and cars.
Since the report, a security unit consisting of 1,000 people has taken care of the rest.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after her visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, 80 police officers were injured in a roundabout as a result of the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the disturbances spread to Toulouse.
The carriage was caused by a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
the Angela empire of the Cloud
The chancellor’s actions have been distracted by the fact that the coalition is coming to an end – and nothing can be expected from him.
In which country does the Federal Chancellor actually live?
In the general debate of the Bundestag, it must be established, in view of its contents, after its act of public interest and unspeakable: it is not here - it is not in the country whose governing would be his business.
Angela Merkel has denied the allegation that she would focus too much on foreign policy.
It’s provincial, he replied, and in this way he just came to the conclusion that he doesn’t want to understand what his critics are talking about.
The Federal Assembly has made it clear to everyone how far-reaching the eyelids are.
In the meantime, no concrete interest or empathy was felt for the problems of the country.
Instead, Angela appeared as the Cloud Gate: a reality-stricken politician who flees to foreign policy and there is only uncertainty of her own.
Climate protection is an example: He commends himself incessantly for the Holyindammi Decisions, but listens to how to achieve the air conditioning goals in the country.
As far as self-esteem is concerned, such modesty would not have been allowed by the CDU president two years earlier.
Now it is stuck in the phrase that prosperity has had a positive effect on people.
With this, he gained a good reputation as a pragmatic personality who provides a solution to problems instead of words.
However, in Angela’s empire, internal political problems are only side-effects.
Poverty of children and low-income workers?
That's just a few semi-finals.
There is much to say from this point of view about the density of language abuse when it comes to family allowances.
Merkel has to keep quiet three times in order to put together a half-legged sentence.
When it comes to concrete issues, you're a barber in a foreign land.
Roham's Department
During the Republican presidential nominees’ debate on Youtube, there was a hard-hit between the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney – and now they have to be held by an outsider.
The tension of the candidates has already fractured to the surface on the first topic.
Mitt Romney denies his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, that he has made New York a “guardian of illegal immigrants.”
He who for his part contradicts serious facts: "I would say that his own house served as a refuge for illegal immigrants," cuts Giuliani back, and coughs it up in the eyes of the former governor of Massachusetts that he treated immigrants without documents.
As the Republican camp still has no uniformly supported favorite, the eight presidential urbanists use the debate on CNN first and foremost to undermine their opponent’s credit.
Videos of 30 seconds of self-release video sent by internet users via Youtube are barely more than short summaries.
“With this kind of isolationism, we have put Hitler in power,” John McCain whispered under his counterpart, Ron Paul, who as the only participant in the round calls for immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney’s head is also thoroughly washed by a Vietnamese veteran when he reluctantly condemns the so-called “Waterboarding” method of interrogation, which simulates water intake.
The fact that the campaign’s important themes, however, are beyond the debates on Iraq and torture, is illustrated by the reactions of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Noisy taps come out in the room when praising conservative values and rejecting future tax increases.
In the meantime, the weakening of the two candidates is becoming more and more apparent.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney apologized and apologized to supporters and TV viewers for voting in 1994, even after her pregnancy was discontinued.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is discouraged when asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf First Governs as a Civilian
A day after his resignation from the military, Musharraf was deposed as President of Pakistan.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf will be deposed for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the capital, the presidential palace of Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to the Constitution and to act for the benefit of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to his secretary, Ashfaq Kiyani, allowing the international pressure coming from the United States in the first place.
The former general, eight years without bloodshed, is now in his first taste as a civilian head of state, following a coup in the form of a military coup.
With Musharraf's resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, the West and the opposition fulfilled a fundamental demand.
Another important demand is the abolition of the state of emergency, which Musharraf declared on 3 November.
Attorney-General Malik Muhammad Qayyum said that Musharraf would soon put an end to the state of emergency with which the West would fulfill a further demand.
The Supreme Court of the country, to which Musharraf had deployed sympathetic lawyers in early November following the proclamation of the state of emergency, last week rejected any objection to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured as a result of an attack on a military convoy in a tribal area in northern Vaziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghan border.
Krautrock's Dads Are Back
The German supergroup of the 1970s played again: The three band members of Harmonia re-released the instrument until a concert in Berlin took effect.
On the occasion of the re-assembly, a cut-off recording from the "Live 1974" era appears.
At the time, they were much more well-known abroad.
The reported sensation took the body in the person of the three agreed gentlemen surrounding the dinner table.
First of all, it has its own instrument, its own cable and, above all, its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in the middle of his throne in snow-white ingrown at the age of 63.
Michael Rother, a 57-year-old boy from left to right, is accompanied by a laptop and guitar.
From the right side of the audience, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius has a curve and focuses on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, while at the same time rhythm.
And sometimes it all comes down to some sort of traditional music.
All of this, however, does not seem to disturb the gentlemen in particular.
It was a great thrill for fans of krautrock music that Harmonia played together again.
What we can already tell here: As a result of proper postprocedure, we can conclude that the name has been transferred to the collective pope's memory, but in no case has left such lasting traces that this band will be painfully missed after 32 years.
But why not celebrate the legends of the Germans of their 70s?
Especially since what we mistakenly call krautrock has always been valued more in England and America than in our own country.
When the music industry awarded the 2003 Echo Award for Lifetime Achievement to members of the Cologne Can band, the German pop figures sat in the room with an incomprehensible face.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers even thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the admiration became limitless.
At the concerts, Michael Rother sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is already exaggerated by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years, and during this time it had far less effect than what others subsequently attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising Cluster name.
Initially, they played in the basement of the Berlin Schaubühne theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, a church-funded record company.
Rother contributes to the Kraftwerk group for a short period of time, and at the same time, perhaps the most radical German band of the time, Neu! gained a reputation as a guitarist.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster's music to their exile in Weserbergland Forest.
There, in Alter Weserhof, they lived in a 16th-century Rom as a communist who escaped from the city.
It is less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still a babysitter.
Their lives are idyllic art.
The flag of the Harmonia Ottenstein was allegedly derived from the garbage, and in this way they found the name of their art.
Some of these things have been recorded by Harmony.
The first album is titled "Musik von Harmonia" and the second album is titled "De Luxe".
Despite his relaxed and humble music, the group suffered from material need.
The collection of spices alone did not provide for their own findings.
"Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record audience of less than 50 people.
Forcing Harmonia and occasional practice was Rother's idea at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral requirement.
The band announced its disbandment in 1975.
Rother turned out of the esoteric and kept himself from albums like "Flammable Hearts".
The Cluster was revived in the 1980s, which has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
The live album in Grönemeyer is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording company, named Greenland, aimed to take care of the krautrock as a special German addition to its live music.
In this context, Neu! has already been presented in the same way as Roedelius's solo work.
The re-establishment of Harmonia takes place in the House of Cultures in Berlin.
From the money, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, our British ancestry and the author of the manuscript "Krautrock Sampler" are also present.
Also present is the ideaary owner of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
All of this largely outlined the effect of krautrock on the upcoming pop eras.
In this respect, Harmonia fills the vacant space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno’s conclusion, along with the most unusual sounds, floats in the room: “The only true music is his future.”
There are pictures depicting the produced with Harmony in the room of a farmhouse.
Additional black-and-white photographs of the wiring equipment are used for legendary construction.
In the foreground, the three veterans are again obsessed with improvisation.
This simply means that microphones are attached to the organ and drums with the intention of triggering sound effects that have not been heard from the instruments with the help of instruments that produce sound effects they own.
Today, electric music seems to be electric music.
Three, tech-intensive squirrels.
Even the home cure doesn’t change anything.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, they crawl and pussy, and sing "Aaaaaaah!" in a beautiful part.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in the arts colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here shouts "'68!" he is not going the wrong way, and that is why Harmonia does not even allow himself to be silenced.
Even the most obvious thing on your own is thoroughly reflected on the stage.
Where does music start and where does it end?
This can nerve-wrack a person, or it can haunt him with his past moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
Through "Waterfall" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films repeatedly deal with the Balkan War.
None of them, however, are convincing.
The basic idea is either overly focused on action and shooting, or too emotional.
Even Richard Gere can't help with the "Sales."
First of all, the good news: Although the two war criminals, Karadzics and Mladics are still falling in the Balkan mountains, it is still there, in the dark background of the Bosnian War, that they have found the actor, Richard Gere.
Recently, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because he played his role in many good-boy emotional films about women, and he gave many press conferences on the topic of Buddhism, even from the fact that we didn’t like him.
And here, suddenly, Richard Gere's the most influential argument in addition to maybe still watching the movie "Sales" c.
It provides a wonderful, smiling design: Basically, the Simon Hunt war-torn he created is exactly what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry weren’t so kind to him: he’s been a part of a man who’s been a little behind me for a thousand years.
However, the film "Sales" and also this week German production "Mörderischer Frieden" began to broadcast, despite this crowd, only an endless series of fallen films about the Balkan War.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" is about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian woman from the Kosovo snipers, and one of them suddenly loves to surrender.
While it is welcome that the Serbs are not once portrayed as the only cause of all the bad, the film that carries the depth of the TV movies is too quickly lost in the shooting and in the eventful scenes.
He's wearing the "Cobra 11" sign - with a war instead of a highway.
On the other hand, in the case of "Sales", one can examine, for example, why not even a single really good film about the Balkan War was made.
The story of the three warriors in the United States who come up to investigate the Serb war criminal who listens to the name "Roka", with other directors, with other screenwriters (both in Richard Shepard's personal union) turned into a "maybe a new age"
In fact, the stories show a surprising similarity: in both cases, small groups cut the forest to do what the army is unable to do – and in both cases, the journey to madness is rounded up.
One of the reasons for the fall of the "Waterhouse" is that he simply doesn't let Simon Hunt be the cynical one who was born into his heart as he was introduced to at the beginning.
No, and in the script, he even spent a romantic relationship with a Muslim Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
"Shopping" is a slippery slope when reporters are able to achieve in the last five minutes of the film in the form of accelerated footage, something that NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters have not been able to do in five years.
This is so bad that one would prefer to turn to the International Court of Justice of The Hague for a crime committed against the logic of cinema.
The film’s purpose is profoundly human.
He intends to argue that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and suspects the Americans and the French (who are said to be exceptionally unified) that they do not continue the persecution in a sufficiently intensive manner because of their secret political abilities.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar to each other that a man comes to mind a famous Brecht verse.
In this poem, the poet writes the following about an Asian demon-figuring legend on the desk: "I look at the drowning hero on his harness, who betrays: how tired it is to be bad."
Films like "Shopping" have the same oversized, human-head-shaped masks, which, however, show how tiresome it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in the newspaper that all the movies about Iraq in Hollywood were shattered.
We can add: There hasn’t been a single good movie about South Africa yet.
Almost always true: If a star flies through the crisis monsters or miners of the world, something like "The Paths of Freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "Without Borders" with Angelina Jolie, or "The Blood Diamond" with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are just too close in terms of time.
For decades they had to wait until Hollywood was able to make a good film about the Holocaust with the film "Shindler's List".
Probably some movies are still coming in - because works about the Vietnam War that are now considered classics, such as "The Cowhunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were not celebrated unanimously as a masterpiece in their own time.
But it is conceivable that today, when all mass murders come to our home in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the world’s conflicts.
And this will deprive the scripts of ignoring the reality that would be needed to tell good stories.
After all, the “Being or Not to Be” or “The Dictator” finally succeeded so well because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn’t even know how terrible the Nazi regime was.
You might not want to do good if you want to make a good movie.
Maybe we should put the novelist Lawrence Norfolk in sarcastic distance art mode.
When asked about the parallels between the Lemprière lexicon and the Balkan war, he replied, "It depends only on the fact that certain things never change.
The big cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beusto is heavily criticized for resigning from the Olympics
The Mayor’s detention has sparked heavy criticism in political and economic life from his bid to organise the Hamburg Summer Olympics.
Many people want to continue to fight for water games.
Von Beus, however, warns strongly about the realities during the loss of opportunity.
The head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called the resignation "unfavorable to the economic environment".
No other project has recently released such huge motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, we would not be able to maintain the same sporting political momentum."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to undermine the project, but to develop a long-term initiative "starting from the modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust has insisted on his previous statements that his ambitions for the Hamburg Olympics are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Hamburg will not decide on the Olympics, but on the German Olympic Sports Association," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation in early December on the Munich bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics.
"Giving this priority to us means that we will not have any realistic chances in the period we have set out so far until 2028."
“We will not give up our dreams forever,” von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) expressed its regret over Von Beust’s statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not intend to compete in the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to take a chance by burying our plans now,” HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
In addition, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement made by the President of the Senate at the General Assembly of the German College Sports Association.
In fact, the application submitted to the University of Hamburg for the 2015 Summer Olympics was characterized by the fact that it did not serve as a substitute for the Hamburg Olympics.
The University Sports Association launched Hamburg last week as the city that participated in the competition.
The SPD's civic faction told the Senate that it had left valuable time in terms of the Hamburg apartment building unused.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it voted in favour of the Olympics and avoided the construction of apartments," said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continuously fractured its chain in relation to the Kleiner Grasbrook with an integrated plan for the Olympic and later residential exploitation, the CDU unilaterally placed the emphasis on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg at the time gave rise to a lot of enthusiasm.
However, he collapsed at Hamburg Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
The person who connects the concepts of Sweden and the village to one another is the Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wall panels made in Sweden put a dark shade on the list of Warhol works.
The ninety-four "Stockholm Type" Brillo Box listed here is largely fake.
After a few months in the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" in question the originality of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes in 1968, the internal investigation of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now reached a highlighting result: in the case of "Pontus Hulten", a former museum director of "Boloch" and "Boloch in Modern" in 1995.
The prehistory is a long and complicated chain of artistic and curatorial demonstrations.
In 1964, Warhol created the first "Brillo Boxes" in New York - painted murals based on the red-blue-white design of the soap box of "Brillo" powder.
At a 1968 exhibition in Moderna Museet - with the consent of Warhol - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard were laid out: they (for cost savings) were not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their templates, simple exhibition pieces.
At the same time, in 1968, Warhol authorised the production of several Brillo houses in Sweden, but they were not established at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the age are now talking about fifteen boxes that have entered the art and auction history under the label "Stockholm type" as the authenticated Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box.
Some of them were auctioned for over <0x24>100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hulten, the legendary director of the museum, later falsely claimed that in 1968 a hundred walls were manufactured and laid out in Sweden, which he then left for Warhol.
In fact, 105 boxes in Hulten were only produced in 1990 for a St. Petersburg exhibition in Malmö.
At that time, however, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the main monumentalist of the Moderna Museet, has also examined six boxes owned by the museum in addition to three private Swedish-owned Brillo Boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: the pressed roller covers and the pressed roller covers for the first time.
On the other hand, the structure of the copies from the 1990s suggests that the paints were applied directly to the rolling sheet with a paint ring, without foundation - and not just oil, but acrylic paint.
“These boxes are not authenticated by the artist, so they should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes,” says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet, “Unless you see the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board as a New Yorker version of the novel.”
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that it had raised "serious charges" against soap porous boxes.
Since then, however, they have been subject to unsolicited hearings.
Manila Rebel Soldiers Released
The insurgency was abandoned in the Philippines by the soldiers who barricaded themselves at a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, he told reporters at the hotel, Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Earlier, the hotel was invaded by light-gas-induced government soldiers.
Two dozen soldiers have been barricading themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team faced trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillannes.
He used the trial to suddenly solve a circle with 30 sympathizers.
The military police in charge of the man's custody apparently joined him and joined the band.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the death of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government units have closed the area of the prominent hotel.
The president has called the security office for an extraordinary meeting.
Norberto Gonzales, a security advisor, condemned the conduct of the soldiers.
"They have a choice for the people," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was formerly the commander of the elite scout rangers, said other units of the army wanted to join the rally within a short period of time.
Judges of the government called for a strong protest against the president on Friday.
His government has been shady for months on corruption charges.
Manila's financial district was the main stage of the 200-member Arroyo rocket attempt in 2003.
The uprising failed after just 24 hours, when the army refused to join.
There have been at least seven coup attempts in the Philippines against democratically elected governments since 1986.
United Internet will be a major player in Versatile
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent stake in Versatel’s telecommunications company.
As the company said on Wednesday night, the average price per share was 14.46 euros.
This amounts to an ownership of 20.05 per cent of the equity.
Assumptions have already been made on the wing before the takeover.
The possibility of raising the share of property acquired in Versatile remains open.
The move is aimed at facilitating the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, presumptions were made of a possible switch-off, after Berenberg Bank raised its stake in the Düsseldorf network provider by an additional 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The financial institution maintains its shareholding to only a third party, reports the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already owned close to 10 percent of Drillish’s mobile phone company.
Within the framework of the increase, Drillish has invested 17.4 million new shares in the amount of EUR 106.4 million.
Of these, United Internet acquired 5.15 million shares for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.4 million.
In addition, the companies initiated a dialogue on cooperation on the launch of DSL and mobile phone products on the market.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a spokesperson for United-Internet said.
The two companies jointly established the MSP Joint Undertaking for the acquisition of the competitor Freenet.
The two companies were initially satisfied with a good ten percent stake in Freenet and did not live up to the right to acquire an additional 18.49 percent stake in Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies leave all options open, especially with regard to the increase in the shares acquired in Freenet AG, the news says.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on the Strategic Partnership were concluded in mid-November.
Freenet has been around for months, and it’s just a matter-of-fact poker game that’s part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contracted mobile phone customers, as well as 1.27 million customers with DSL and wired access.
The holding company United Internet and Drillish had so far a direct 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
Now there is an agreement that Drillish will bring an additional round of 4%.
The agreement on the right to purchase 18.49 per cent of Vatas investment company was born in August.
