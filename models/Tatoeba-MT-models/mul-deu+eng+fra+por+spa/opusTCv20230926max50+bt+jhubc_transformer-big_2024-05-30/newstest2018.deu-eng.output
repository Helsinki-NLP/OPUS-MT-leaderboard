Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
It’s an irren event where young people are supposed to meet today.
A graveyard chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now excavated.
Kids gardeners manage the former grounds of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to the day.
It’s frustrating if the maps are not up to date.
This is known by everyone who has had to be excited, because the car navi showed a green meadow instead of a surround road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlas, an offer of the state government’s geoportal Bavaria, are all but up-to-date – but that’s why it’s very informative.
Especially when comparing them to current online cards.
Then it will be clear how cities and municipalities in the area of distribution of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a flickering carpet that is not recognized as such.
In the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, were incorporated for cities and municipalities.
These were created according to the Bavarian Measurement Administration between 1810 and 1864 and originated in Bavaria's first measurement.
His client: Napoleon.
The French army leader had occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria – of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: it was the modern-day neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria map.
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Measurement Administration.
The original paper for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian National Library.
The previous/today comparison is the most impressive in the example of the country capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is subsendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.
Sendling was incorporated into the Munich district 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877.
Today, the suburbs are in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganser Straße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian peasant revolt against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-numbered pieces of the so-called "Uragraf" from which the land tax was derived.
Small parcels are no longer found there by farmers - they are small gardeners of the "Land in the Sun" plant.
A large green area is distinguished north by subsendling.
Theresienwiese, since 1810 the venue of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen or from the height "On the Fans" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, at Auerfeldstrasse, people were once locked up with crazy ideas.
There, in 1858/59, the Munich district irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the facility - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the investigation of the so-called fools.
In addition, he has banned staff from using violence against the occupants,” says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, which has been involved in an exhibition with the facility.
There was room for 280 patients at first, and was later extended to 500.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreiserrenanlage in Haar in 1905.
It has been home to the Isar Amper Clinic Munich-Ost since 2006, one of Germany’s largest psychiatric clinics.
In the area of the former Auer anstalt, young people meet at the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities.
West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, eastern residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was erected - in architectural propensity to the original construction of the irrene facility, which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombings.
Marienplatz was listed as the "main square" around 1856, the Kauffingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change also brought the Second World War to the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allied bombs broke many holes in the city centre.
A big one remained until today - in the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval excavation chapel once stood at Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the spatenstich for the second S-Bahn tribal route took place.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to today’s aerial picture – and fill the hole at Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to colored people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel through the state and to pay extra attention to it in advance, as a series of questions of questions will be asked about the time.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination claims, as well as the state’s criminal prosecution authorities, which disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
“They have civil rights violations that happen to people.
They’re stopped because of their skin color, they’re collapsing or they’re killed,” Missouri NAACP president Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints at such a frequency that we have not heard yet.”
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had no more gas during his state trip and was detained by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The council also pointed to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be detained than whites.
“The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be ready to bring deposits or let their relatives know they’re traveling through the state.”
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the country’s 16th rank.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder for a company to sue for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws that obliged local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will continue to prosecute the ACLU.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but interest groups have recently implemented the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weed fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
CDU MPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.
At the fairground of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and a lot of young animals, and hosts five apartments.
For him, "black forest milk" is the non-alternative way of marketing the milk of his cows, Schwendemann said.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
As BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the lawn fence project as "elementarly important".
I can't manage on such steep surfaces profitably.
The Greenland area provides a lot of work, much needs to be processed with the engine sense.
"We have to deal with the conditions and the topography here," Schwendemann said.
In 2003, he took over the parent farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not run a bio farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the lawn fence project and is pleased with the Leader promotion".
At a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3,000 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,000 per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the areas could be carried out for a long time.
“The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue their operations,” the mayor said.
Farmers are often criticized for their promotion.
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of 11 participants were fenced on the farm fence.
The open-ended area is therefore 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be forested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71,500 euros, half were funded via Leader, and a quarter was funded by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12,610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers it is not possible".
Peter Weiß also stated: “Here the best food is produced.”
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) of Baden-Württemberg allows the state to promote pasture fences.
The aim is to preserve the Black Forest.
Prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor line designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be manageable by tractors (hanging above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weed Fence Project 2018, the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 parcels who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence.
The open storage area is 35 hectares, the estimated cost is more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump is taking over the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other – which is why Saddam Hussein’s carefully staged fall on Firdo’s Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime’s key ideologists, knew for sure what he was doing when he took a symbolic axis in a heated dispute with CNN’s Jim Acosta about the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lied to him if he had.
But he attacked their significance, and especially the significance attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller Acosta whispered, “I don’t want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller is actually right, but as he himself formulated it, it’s not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the outrageous words of Lazarus, which are the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired ones, your poor ones, your oppressed masses, those who crave those who want to eat / free."
There was never a time when the "living garbage" on our screens could be seen better.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people in Trump’s U.S. are not welcome.
This conflict over the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is in fact a conflict over the significance of America.
Lazarus – and her friends, who endeavored to place their words at the base after her death – knew very well that they were carrying out a high-political act.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in an exploited classical representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract – she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: the mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American natism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change it from the right wing for a long time.
The great scribe Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptizer for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neoconservative who brings the American flame into the overnight world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not intended to illuminate the way to the United States."
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has come up with something here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great fantasy of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on board ships.
In the true sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they need to hear.
And of course, that’s not the perspective Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.
Their torches are not intended to illuminate the way, but to ignite the hatred, which is their only source of power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
UK Athletics Performance Director Neil Black says that the 16-headed Scottish team in the World Cup squad "will make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the UK's light athletics needs to learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out,” Black said.
“I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy in the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team as the team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain’s speech was incredible,” says Black.
“A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or practiced, left the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally was great."
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in her fifth World Championships at the 400m hurdles, says it's "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the UK team.
Scotland’s highest total number of athletes at the World Championships so far was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The midfielder Muir is on this path and has set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in medals and finals.
“The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other team members, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me,” she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb the podiums.
What did I say as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it’s really important to rely on this home support and take advantage of the fact that we’re back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and there's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking Critics via Facebook: Don’t Become a Public Officer if You Can’t Stand Up With Voter Warming Up
The father of our country knew something about the bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him over everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He shuddered at the criticism, of course.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away – and, dumb and mute, we are led to slaughter like sheep.”
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, and?" .
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head on his side after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially called and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hated people who swing the whistle online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who talk to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hated, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comments section of The Post.
“I don’t appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of citizens concerned.”
What the governor’s employees called a “concentrated spam attack,” others would likely call a “foreign language.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It’s much cleaner than in the past, if you had done the same thing, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guide articles, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for blaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue fell in Virginia last week.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letterwriters engaged in his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that downplayed Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom overwhelm his office, according to historical documents collected from the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former No. 1 European Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led to the final round next to the Archerfield Left last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and serves as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club be built, and we've seen it reach its glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place.
He is an enthusiastic defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course.”
Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the program in the year after I won it.
Getting back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on the ground floor.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do well, but you feel this extra pressure as well.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I’m happy about how it has gone so far.”
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Less lung cancer death due to passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Researchers from the University Clinic of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come up with this finding in a study.
“We estimate that 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoke,” said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew on his own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time, there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction works in the Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are in some measure in time," said Fred Heinze, the head of the building.
In the field of house connections, the situation is more complicated than is suspected, as much is hidden underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp construction group.
"Ignorance of the drivers from red lights and shutters is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road is blocked and only the buses are allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already pretty stressful.
But fortunately, we were supplied with cold mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the chilled tuber is removed and swallowed with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with dark water from the nearby sink.
A pot in a dachshund room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late to work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.,” she says.
It is a rare insight into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders should vote by a public hand-in-hand poll before the occupying forces.
An existing movement that stirred up for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent portion of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour morning rental car ride.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated roofs converted by rust into various yellowish-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, despite the fact that journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” says Degei, pointing to her vibrant, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her light skirt.
"Earlier, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province of the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined <0x24>3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated <0x24>78 billion.
These fortunes, however, are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains a stunning presence.
A 2005 New York Times survey reported that Freeport paid local military and units nearly <0x24>20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to <0x24>150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gangs and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua’s Tribal Highlands in the 1970s were genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
“We Will Lose Everything,” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which contains reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture – rape and electrocuting are particularly popular, according to another report.
“It is difficult to count the number of casualties as incidents occur every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua’s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province’s population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell roasted chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with nut sauce.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
“Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It has cost the native Papua - the Mama Mama [the women] of Papua - its market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known popularly as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former chamberlain secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua – including Paniai – on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, expecting him to fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” You said.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took up her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their pistols, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A 16-year-old child, Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They performed ceremonial hunting arcs and performed the Waita dance - running in the circle and imitating a bird singing - by Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began slamming stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was warmed, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document by TIME, which was not released to local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for rest and called on the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colourful wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he added.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” said John, who, like many Indonesians, wears only one name, the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it would be attacked.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others injured.
The news of the killings came 'filtered' to Jakarta the next day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical unrest in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to remedy historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
“Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been reported, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims responded to such claims with grueling disbelief.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress,” John says.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
“After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company’s headquarters.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
“We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge,” says 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lived near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were quickly delivered here, according to TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been an unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribals living in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua's rights by spurring sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judah Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "saving national sovereignty".
Some never reappear.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as “a tragic, forgotten place.”
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here build on everything they eat: especially notes and fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can each cultivate four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and new migrants, who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the skills needed to run their own businesses competitively.
“Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting to international media remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given a rare permit to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Asia at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s campaign to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's restless eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread injuries" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically seen support for the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group’s allegations, saying journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to hide the evidence for human rights cases.”
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and forced him to "we want freedom", according to a source who also wanted to attend the meeting but remained anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," said Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says the Panii people, like other Papuans, view their voice for Jokowi as a “debt” that he has to pay back.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, the families of the Paniai victims carried out a final symbolic act of treason: the corpse of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they don’t let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," Yacobus says with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures the ‘Torch’ skyscraper from Dubai for the second time
A fire broke out on Friday in one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the high house in just two years, which is accidentally called the torch tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and the screaming of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said the firefighting units cleared the fire at 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing accommodation for the affected people.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the dressing, outerwear for decoration or insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe the system of disguise and isolation plates at London’s Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed some 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best of Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has won a major Davis Cup Cup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles on only two wins was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, although often very long, but that is why they are highly valued, remain the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of member states voted for the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was almost missed.
“We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the applications.
It was not until the vote, after many objections, that the proposal was made to hold the final in a neutral place.
As of 2018, only comparatively smaller details are available: the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce costs for the organizers, requirements for training venues etc. will be eased and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. Travellers Brings Banned Items On Air, Survey Finds
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent of consciously or unconsciously prohibited items were smuggled past the US Transportation Security Administration’s checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with knives.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they were late to discover that they were mistakenly travelling with guns, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately rushed past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying items with blades through security checks, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs on the plane.
The company said it had asked travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling goods through the airport security and how many would have done it intentionally.
It’s no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggling goods – knowingly or unconsciously – through security were the ones who flew most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure of what fluids they are allowed to carry or how much of them.
It is therefore no surprise that most of the items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a time, people thought that the TSA could view books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk Says Tens of Thousands of Tesla Customers Cancel Order
Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far denied that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-trigger figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time revealed another, less glowing figure in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
Musk had often advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in the past months, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: out of a total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the 1000 euro (<0x24>1,000 in the U.S. and <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 in the UK) “reservation payment”.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding bookings are underway, Musk said in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, Tesla does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders so far could be a problem.
His argument: The challenge of the ambitious growth goals is not in demand, but in production.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it will be - all models combined - 500,000, in 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 bookings per day.
Those who order a "model 3" today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest – if Tesla manages to drive its new, never-to-be-tested production lines without major interruptions with maximum exploitation.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are any major delays, the non-compliance of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can not prevent unsatisfied customers from running away from it.
EPA chief Pruitt resigns due to delaying Obama-era rules to reduce emissions
One day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules in order to reduce emissions of smog from air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the case that had been brought against his previous position in a Federal Appeal Court.
It is a deadline for states to comply with the 2015 standards for soil-based ozone on October 1.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly switched to blocking or delaying regulations opposed by the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.
The sudden reversal from Wednesday is the latest legal backlash for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards would simply reinforce the EPA’s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation,” said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that exists to us seriously.”
However, the EPA's opinion stated that Pruitt will at some point use his "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on a sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A bill passed last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is produced when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of the public health sector and environmentalists rejoiced over Pruitt’s surprising change of course.
"It's worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the air protection officer we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological crucifixion of the Trump administration to commit to environmental polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church is invited to a serenade at the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4:30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius resort is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
Rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the area have made Tumlingen’s friends and sponsors their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique village little thing."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was mentioned for the first time in the Württemberg documentary book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church located on it to Tumlingen and the Vogtie" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Mark Silberch for 20 Dietrich.
According to the text of the document, on the Tumlinger Mountain, besides the former parish church, there was also a royal court, to which the church or patronage law belonged, and not vice versa.
There were also people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are now just to be recognized in the town of Tumlingen, was the "mountain" of the third, the dominant settlement core of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 support these historical events.
The patronage law arose from the early medieval church ownership law.
A Lord who built, equipped and occupied a church with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.
The right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop was associated with this.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two broke down at Christmas 1673.
The newly-built bell then first ringed in 1692, but had to be fired later in World War II in 1942.
In the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were hacked and the bells were stolen.
The roof was empty.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the canteen and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the Hörschweiler dead.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In the New Year’s Eve of 1834, a storm broke the church tower and half of it collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the Turmzwerg, which still exists today, has been preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Sheep Pensioners" are running the Hilarius plant as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn.
As organizers, the friends and promoters of Tumlingen invite to the St. Hilary's Chapel on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade at the old cemetery.
It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with the words of Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The programme starts at 4:30 p.m.
Check-in is from 15.30.
At the end of the Serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
" Enjoy a summer evening in the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers show off the fantastic view.
Serenade occurs only in dry weather.
The organizers hope that many supporters will receive the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumbling and hearing loss.
Tumlingen’s friends and sponsors feel particularly committed to home care, as confirmed by Serenade organiser Walter Martini.
Association Wants to Examine Approval of Wind Bikes
"Boisheim defends itself" does not see a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the land council.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the planned construction of wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.
It's illegal. It's illegal.
The association argues that at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in Viersen there was only a wind turbine concentration zone at the city limit to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone is an exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier due to a change in the land use plan, it had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf due to a forming error.
"Due to the lack of planning legal prerequisites, the approval notice is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of Boisheim.
Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the City Council has again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; an approval of the district government is still pending.
Rekens: "This is where the granting of an authorisation for the construction of wind turbines is excluded by planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received at the Circle of Foursen since last week," a spokesman said.
The circle takes them to the occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped.
In view of the ongoing proceedings before the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the argument of the association "Boisheim defends itself" on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans the construction of four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had signed contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11,400 households can be met - which corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
NEW RE wants to invest around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million.
Last summer, the City Council of Viersen gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Linnich near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in <0xC3><0x9C>bach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor collide: woman dies in horrific accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally wounded.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The road was blocked for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich drove the L 333 towards Bogel in her car while driving with her 53-year-old mother.
City and dealers plan "home shops" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover shopping in downtown in September.
The business association and the city council want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract residents to the shopping center.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the “home-shops” weekend will raise customers’ awareness about what offers the city has to offer away from the usual supermarket goods.
Accordingly, a market with regional providers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies will present themselves with their training spaces.
In addition, the downtown shops will be invited to the "midnight shops".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, says Christian König.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
As a result, the trade association and the city are entering into another stage of the project "Attractive downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "active day" for the fountain party as well as sales Sunday, conversations with all business owners and hosts to move them to active participation.
Attractive Saturday offers and the abandonment of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be re-opened or re-opened.
This includes tourists and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the downtown when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revive the downtown - up to landlords, businesses throughout the city and associations.
It was with a network to overcome the lethargy, which had partly expanded, King said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thüringer cities will take part in the third national “home shops” day for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should “promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities more strongly,” Stig said.
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his own direct environment with his or her purchasing behavior.
Two dead and several injured after U.S. school explosion
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people have been injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them severely.
According to the firefighter, another injured was in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
A person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A first missing person was also later recovered.
The deceased were school employees.
As the cause of the accident, the authorities suspected they were working on a gas pipeline.
During the holidays, few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump puts pressure on Mexico after hacked transcripts of phone calls due to payment of border walls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders from Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president reproached him for publicly announcing the wall and reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump began his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said that a trade for the U.S. to take on refugees who emigrated to Australia would be " ridiculous", "my" and "dummy" and that the existence on the trade, which was mediated by the Obama administration, would make him look like a "depp" after he placed a ban on the U.S. smuggling.
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying to Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore Ford Massacre: Activists Re-introduce racist Lynchat as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and climbed onto the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns emerged to block his way.
The leader of the mob – a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit – took a long train at his cigarette and looked through the windshield inspecting.
Inside, the occupants floated in fear.
"We want this n----r Roger!" the man whispered.
“Get him out of the car!”
Screaming broke the silence when a young black man was cut off from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a replay.
But then when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience uttered very real screams.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were joined by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"It's really inconceivable that no one has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organize the reconstruction.
“It’s a dirt spot on a story, but it’s a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the revision serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A forensic doctor puts a towel over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch trial.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer election campaign.
Approximately at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom took down a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight – allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid <0x24>600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they moved away from the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynch mob surrounded the car.
“As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and arranged the murders,” an FBI report concludes.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more convincing.
“It was a vote-right massacre,” he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you here.'
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has been leading the annual replication of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Her portrayal is conspicuous, gripping, and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to look, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about the Lynch, because then we’ll be confronted with its ugliness in all of us,” she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or not want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors – a dozen whites and the rest blacks – rushed into a room and heard when Greene started a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has played the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to go back to those times.”
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, who screams at the horse and oppresses him, angry that he had slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--- he disappeared from my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughed the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still whispering.
"I just don't think white people at the time said a --- he."
"But," whispered one of the other black performers.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R'."
And that’s where the energy moves in the room, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting it right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and with emphasis.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a sad dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's sad lovers "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is divided almost equally between black and white.
A couple is coming from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They’ve all experienced Georgia’s depressing moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the body name.
Kids hover at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy whispered as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanked the crowd – and suddenly it was over.
The actors throw the lynx rope away and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the Clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his comrades and then breaks into her arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispered.
"We know it's not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta talks about the re-enactment with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance feeling.
“It’s hard to hear these terrible words and actions ... coming from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today this is called only police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks keeps the court at his table, he eats and remembers civil rights.
He said he had already begun to plan the performance next year.
“The reproduction is inspiring in some way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
“It’s like if we don’t learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own history, who does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it.
"God's Darkness" reconciled the Wagners in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf sets out on a colorful-frivolous stage in front of a giant, six-storey scene.
The rotational stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally displays a slender street corner with walls and dungeons in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from DDR periods or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it is an open Mercedes-Oldtimer, in which the Rhine Girls pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels reminiscent of Castorf’s leitmotiv – money, power and greed – which draws through his “ring” stage.
The three Rhine Girls - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in "Rhine Gold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), dismantles a corpse in the trunk and gives the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the beautifully ugly garden surrounded by the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Oak) has to believe it.
The audience thanked the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humbled themselves and bent their hands on Merkel’s revenge, are celebrating stormy.
There is great applause for the party orchestra, which first appears on stage - given the great heat again in empty leisure clothes.
Excitingly expected was the performance of Frank Castorf and his directorial team.
If he had yet to give up a valid Pfeif concert in 2013, there was a great jubilee five years later, in which the unified "bow" cries underwent.
Party manager Katharina Wagner was pleased.
"You'll notice that the audience has grown together with the 'ring' in some way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of its viewpoint.
I have a positive resume.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places at the same time during their volunteer year.
Everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the Furniture Exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the Furniture Bridge.
I also worked all day in the open school.
How are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so you are a late volunteer.
How's that?
Quantity: I have graduated.
And then a construction engineering degree, let's say, successfully discontinued.
I’ve realized for myself that it’s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Make a social year, there's an insight, there you can see how it's really on the spot, maybe even at the focal point.
And was it?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social sciences in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training in the Youth Office of Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from the old-fashioned home to youth work - in all facets of social work.
It was very varied for me.
I was also partly in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was the right thing that irritated me.
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in the Engineering Department?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of you, each with a completely different story behind you.
Whether it is a refugee or a youth who has been taken out of the family – you always have to take care of it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any touch beds?
Quantity: I'm not the type for that.
It is an area that gives a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but so is life.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividends by 72 percent as another restructuring program was launched to overcome the pressure the company faced.
The job cut, which John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, is in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million (<0x24>394 million) in a third cost reduction program to revive a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after it achieved a 1% increase in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Kabul Convoy Attack: NATO Soldier Killed in Suicide Attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement from NATO said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in the incident in Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence in Afghanistan this month – more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion occurred on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device carried by persons".
The statement says that all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the country’s deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs in to increase the number of US troops supporting the country’s military and police.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and especially in the name of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has repealed a decision to postpone a regulation of the Obama administration, according to which states are obliged to curb smog-causing emissions. This happened one day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push forward the so-called “Ozone Regulations 2015” and said it showed the agency’s commitment to cooperate with states.
“We believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners,” EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA’s intention to delay the Ozone Regulations – which are intended to measure pollutant emissions in a part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards – by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has attempted to reverse a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that, according to Trump, is intended to boost economic growth.
However, the efforts have sparked the backlash of Democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that inhaling air containing ozone “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
The City Council wants a common space
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Einzeln decides to establish a community space in the future senior residence.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property has been signed, Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.
While it will still take until the area belonging to the church community is already in the municipality, there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be voted on by a private investor.
For this reason, there is a discussion about a common space.
One of the two investors who are still on the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipality pretend to provide such a community space not only as a meeting point for the residents of the senior residence, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word from the "knitting café" made the round.
The decision, which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the renovation area.
The creation of a community space, Tjaden reports, would be eligible with 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision is intended to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw a button between his legs in this regard, the finding that both saddle - which is related to the environmental construction - and pulp roof - which reduces the height of climbing and makes the construction more economical -.
Unnecessarily, not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks, be this addition.
If it helps, he unanimously passes the board.
It’s not that easy in the common space.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many of her own buildings that you can't go so far, for which you now lie down at the common space from the window, she says, "I'm making it hard."
Yvonne Stager is absolutely in favour of the Community area, but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to either wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area you do not give a grant, but you get a real counter value, which can be marketed in doubt, is the opposite.
Stirger's request to split the proposal accordingly finds three proponents.
Thus, with two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we make the decision this way, we are making a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: Radler is slipped on the street
A 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured while crossing the street.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been coming from Hilden at 12.20 p.m. with his bicycle on the road bike path of the Black Road.
The senior wanted to cross the tram at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder was on the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic.
He met with a car that was driven by a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was shot down on the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital in a rescue truck.
FC Bayern Munich must give up David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game go against Dortmund.
With staff support, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the cup winner.
Staff earnings for the German football record champion Bayern Munich will increase before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 pm/ZDF and Eurosport) with Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also give up David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
Also missing are the Munichers Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the past six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical condition and the imbalance in the game of his team responsible.
"We know we are not in the best physical constitution," Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good last time."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team is showing these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel of the two German football heavyweights draws the fans in their bans.
The game was sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking in the resin from star to star
In the resin, the first "star trail" will be created in the state.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A “star trail” meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
Members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations thereon.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-accessible installations at five to six locations" in the upper resin.
Inquiry comes from St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the boards should be supplemented by the Internet.
This is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Trail will be extended by train.
"On the star trail, viewers learn a lot of information, for example, about the physics of the individual stars," the association said.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more brightly than another, although it is farther away.
It will also be reported in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best seen.
The association has been operating the highest stellar guards in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is among the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be clearly seen with the naked eye.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned stern whale - the Planetenweg.
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its stellar paths leads up to the Hainberg and the stargate - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (community similar) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets – including Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the endpoint – are set exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planet's path is about four kilometers.
While sunlight takes about eight hours to reach Pluto, pedestrians need a good hour to reach Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super Springweight Champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
“I’ve climbed [to 140 pounds] for Broner, but I’m not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to lose weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
This is what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Climate asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year in order to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts).
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, expressing himself later open to fighting with the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready...”
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "a huge fighter", and he may be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said he thinks the three-game champion from Riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted the co-op."
Garcia said the focus was to show strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum built up for their own struggle.
“This is the battle that must be fought.
No other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured after tyre placement
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were partly seriously injured.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at about 4:30 p.m. just before the connecting point, probably after a tyre pitcher.
The car slid to the right into the badge, where he overtook himself and then remained on the roof in the green stripe.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During the first care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked north for about an hour, then traffic on the left lane could be passed at the scene of the accident.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triple Chain Works Better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2–2 season against Braunschweig that the optimisation of the defensive formation will bring Aue points.
With the first game of the season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result, too, if the two opponents had not been in the 2-2 match against Braunschweig.
"There were two sides too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna defender Düsseldorf.
In the Arzgebirge, the triangular chain is to be further optimized.
And a gate after a free throw does not want to catch fortunes anymore.
“For the future, it will be like no one else is standing next to Michael [Rensing].”
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better suited to the three-chain preparations than to the four-chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedehelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his case, "because we have players in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann who can build well right in the three-chain semi-positions," Hoffmann said.
"It's a prerequisite, but that we harmonize even better and we don't make so many playback mistakes in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about a failed start after an indecision, I don't know.
The performance could be quite good,” Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper seasonal pace."
His coach didn’t want to know about it.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight game days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the Saxons' game in Heidenheim had to be cancelled early due to the weather.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that Aue players might even be a little fresher as they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a climbing favorite in the bones.
“But they don’t know 100 percent where they are at the moment,” said Fortuna’s internal defender.
Even though the guests from the Rhineland will go to the meeting on Sunday at the (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
“It’s nonsense that we take them away just because we have the right to be among the first six,” says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive in just a nine-game defeat against Aue.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the front," says Fortuna's chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant".
And that’s how Funkel doesn’t want his players to experience on Sunday.
New Results of Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests Released
The most recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of people tested are over 18 years old. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedizinalverket) has started conducting the tests last year.
They are expected to make the age assessment more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticized for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "possibly under the age of 18".
The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
“We don’t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are pretty constant,” he told The Local magazine.
The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases suggesting that the person examined was 18 years of age or older.
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly stated that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institutet, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say it for sure, we shouldn’t act as if we could,” he told Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is under 18, in this case it’s about 10 percent.”
Fully in the plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well underway.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
“We are very good at the time, it’s going great,” says Reinhold Leicht, Head of Construction at the Department of Road Transport and Transport in the Government Presidency of Freiburg.
In April, the work began simultaneously on all three renovation-needed bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule will be complied with.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a curved arc bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come into the years.
In order to ensure the stability and traffic safety, the three structures are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve and 10.60 meters long, respectively.
The bridge at the site entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons of so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a edge fastening, which is also used as a way of operation.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap will be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
This is where the pedestrian path will run.
The special thing is that these are manufactured parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Particular fingertip feeling has required the laying of wires through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiberglass cable, to which many companies are connected.
Residents were informed of the project by handbook in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be caught first.
For the bridges between the building building and the collecting beacon in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a lamp.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher Ortseingen, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely blocked.
The cost of the three bridge renovations totals <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>700,000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter protest at German potato salad
It is not so often that parties are pulling on a strand, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat.
The parties represented in the district Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that peacefully flags on this day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the poster "great election campaign pace".
And well-known names start - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland form the top duo for the September 24 federal parliamentary election, and the deputy federal president Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on the scene hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "Everyone at a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus right before the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A good picture that is offered there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the One World Forum and one of the key organizers, is rightly pleased: "Great how many people have gathered here".
There’s music and a lot of food, including a “German potato salad that the AfD could eat without any problems,” says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to go to Gerolstein, showing their presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters from the venues.
How did the AfD come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulcan Apple reported that he had been working on such an event and received the grant.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially requested in Daun, but was fired there because of the already built Laurentius skirmishes there were not enough parking spaces.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondell Square, he says: "This is the good law of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
It does so too: at 8 p.m. on the Rondell Vorplatz, a band provides entertainment, in the city hall, several speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal president Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence remains unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the premises have a longer breath, but it is also recommended to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can take off - no special incidents.
Posaune meets Trompete
A rehearsal with Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli will be held in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in blast music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in European top orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a soloist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both unite the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach, as in a new outfit, joins Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by Jazz Prize winner Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free play are blended into a fascinating work of art.
This core piece of the program was only launched this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Monastery Church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything,” says Kristen Stewart openly about her bisexuality.
“When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, ‘Oh that was cool, what’s next?’”
The Hollywood star's most well-known relationship was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with every single one I've ever dated.
Or do you think I’ve played it?”
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: “I’ve always lived through dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not to be taken seriously.”
Especially among them, she suffered according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, rather than dressing up like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was 11, the kids told me I would look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, frightened and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, ‘Girl, be proud of you!’”
Especially in the public, they don’t like to explain their love life: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And some may call me ungrateful, but I don’t like to have to justify myself in front of the public.”
The Governor of West Virginia Announces He Will Change the Party
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> West Virginia’s Democratic Governor, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me,” Governor Justice said.
“Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor.”
The announcement broke out in Jubel.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration with the Republicans," Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play a different game.”
Mr. Trump promised a major announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about <0x24>1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night saying, "The change of Governor Justice's party is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again."
“With only 15 governments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, some message,” the RNC said in a press release.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
Worldwide head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, on Thursday praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the time for the country to be reinstated into the sport.
Russia’s head of athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that banning his country from sports was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he felt sorry for "all the athletes who were kidnapped in competitions for gold and silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized with itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is being redesigned.”
Coe said he was also "happy" that Russia would accept the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force’s recommendations that this is not the time to re-use Russia,” Coe said.
“We have to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
“The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral at the World Athletics Championships, which will begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for a resettlement.
Drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still active, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Disappointed Soldiers Defeated in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar, northern Hesse, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security measures.
Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the unexplained cause of the collapse.
She described the two dead pilots as "experts in their field."
"We refuse to accept the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from North Hesse were killed on Wednesday in West Africa’s Mali.
Her sarge was transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a death guard of the Bundeswehr to the Fritzlar Dom St. Peter.
At noon, only members of the church said goodbye.
After that, the mourning celebration began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politics.
Among them were Hessen’s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the sarge.
In front of the church, Fritzlars and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and deployed experience.
The chief of staff built the fighter helicopter Tiger's flight operation in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Also Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, declared: "If this crew could not avoid the collapse, no one would have been able to."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister der Leyen: the operation is dangerous.
But it is also of high importance “for a country from which we are separated by only two states,” she said.
After the funeral, the saddles were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they will be invaded, the Federal Army did not provide any details.
Prince Henry doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henry (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was reported by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn N<0xC3><0xB8>rgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The queen agreed with her husband’s decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henry will be buried, it is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be placed in his French home.
Prince Henry had never made a heel of not being happy with his title.
After the ascension of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and was awarded the title "Princess".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not see himself as equal to his wife, even after his death, said Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman for the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will finally be, it is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be stationed in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years.
The born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobleman, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked in the French Embassy at the Themse.
During his later wife’s flight of sympathy from the people, Prince Henry, in his nearly 50 years of regency, had a difficult standing with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said of the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk socks instead of knit socks, Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of societally critical intellectuals in this country, I could not hope for reluctance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants quick re-election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is resigning after losing the red-green majority for a quick re-election of the country’s parliament.
Because on Friday he spoke out for the dissolution of Parliament.
Earlier, the surprise exit of a Green MP from their national parliamentary faction in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official election date, the Red-Green coalition in Hannover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
Former Green MP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said in Hanover on Friday.
CDU Group Chief Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to adopt them.
As a result, the CDU and the FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxon Landtag, the SPD and the Greens.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new national day will be chosen regularly on January 14 of next year.
Thümler said the red-green government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil believes it is essential that the Landtag decides its self-determination as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its next move on Tuesday.
The National Constitution also provides for the possibility that the National Day withdraws the trust of the Prime Minister and elects a successor.
"Our constitution offers a number of options.
These possibilities need to be legally examined cleanly,” Thumler said.
“You will discuss all questions in peace when they are legally reasonably examined.”
Thümler called Twesten's step "but something curious".
She said: “I’m not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She referred to herself as a supporter of black-green.
The Greens called on the deputies to return their country's parliamentary mandate.
“Of course, we assume that she will return her country’s parliamentary mandate, which she has received through the Green List, with immediate effect,” said Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner, presidents of the country.
Green Party chairman Anja Piel said: "We regret Elke Twesten's decision exceptionally."
She has deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
“Even in the face of the fact that there were no content differences, we cannot understand this step.”
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the infraction of the Lower Saxon Greens MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
“The behavior of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of Red-Green,” the Federal Head of Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the Landtag.
The departure of Twestens in Lower Saxony costs the majority.
The politician "in her hurt vanity and in her frustration puts her personal interests ahead of the welfare of the country", SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil criticized.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony joins in this dirty intrigue game and tries to beat political capital out of it".
Lower Saxony’s CDU faction chief Björn Thümler wants to recommend his deputy to include every vest in the CDU.
The head of the SPD faction in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 Landtagswahl.
The CDU was the strongest power before the SPD at the time, but the SPD and Greens had a very thin majority in the country's parliament.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxins, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How consumers can protect themselves.
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and responding in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the Bundesländer use the latest information on the affected egg loads.
The affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if after everything we know right now, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take on the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the educator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal government.
Nevertheless, my house has been shut down immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany’s concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade, as well as the manufacturers, has to ensure that the products sold are transportable and healthy.
If eggs have exceeded the maximum residue level of 0.005mg/kg, they are not transportable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it is not the fault of the companies.
Are production companies and consumers on the same boat?
According to the current level of knowledge, the production plants are not directly liable.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices of service undertakings.
As always, there are too few controllers.
Is it just the staff or the ultimate responsibility?
It was the official controls that revealed the process.
However, it is also true that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent clarification of such events and the transfer to the prosecutors in cases where crimes may exist are crucial.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete clarification from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain exclusively safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
Due to the panned funds, manufacturers, dealers and consumers are put in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the holding of food-providing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
It must be worked consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be clarified quickly and seamlessly.
How football’s financial rules affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenses of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spain’s Barcelona to French Paris-Saint-Germain.
There will be some consequences for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the leading organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules, which were put into effect by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG must prove at some point that Neymar’s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million (<0x24>262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money easier for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but must counteract with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break-even points in their soccer-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on enormous debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from focusing on the clubs’ debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – should become a tougher issue.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And even though Platini fell into disrepair in 2015 from the presidency, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to work to discourage excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a flat rate, it can allocate the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the replacement sum for the next five years can be set at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million in annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, along with Abu Dhabi, which is in the possession of Manchester City, took the most severe sanctions.
PSG received a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (at the time <0x24>82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million – and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs that might try to overlook their financial oversight by blowing up their revenues by companies affiliated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeds the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of PSG payments to Neymar could come from payments made by the World Cup 2022 organising committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have disputed that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a maneuver could be easy to find out for UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million with a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and shirt sales.
The association assumes that after the signing, sales will increase by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers go, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's final ownership to PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga’s reservations against a state that finances a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country.”
Swiss is looking for a new shoe supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: the airline rewrites the contract.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "North-West Switzerland" on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to current plans, Airline will enter into a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be inspected every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"With the current supplier Chocolat Frey, we are very satisfied," the spokeswoman said.
Approximately 17 million small red-white-packed shotguns at 14 grams a year distribute flight attendants to passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "North-West Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more importantly, the advertising effect is: for a shoe manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
How many candidates there are in the new tender, the Swiss does not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migro’s daughter, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had delivered the chocolate tablets.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, customers of the First Class will be spoiled with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class nearby passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
On the short run, Swiss Schoggi distributes Chocolat Frey, both in business and in the Economy Class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic winner Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time World Champion will fight for a medal in the finals on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic winner, had failed in the national championship and could only watch the discussion competition from the tribune.
Also with the first attempt, Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 metres away, qualified for the final.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s Grunge era (as the forerunners David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for Paul to Paul, for their bankers, for their 2001s, berr Ruliza.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing cowardly children who will grow up - they still created the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more to the casting can principle, including a reef to the Stalker films of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Looks at the Cradle").
At one point, a character stutters through an Apple powerbook, some in-line skates, and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The beloved Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, still hasn’t forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his virginity.
And there’s another crazy-malicious plot that involves Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now supported by George H. W. Bush (a successful impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It’s especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon’s lipstick of “Singles,” whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could heat up this franchise like a sort of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the American scene of "Summer the Homi."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-to-west wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-spoken Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like one.
With six long episodes, it pulls in, and the comedy is not fast enough or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited to a smaller length, could deliver his Agitprop satire better as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men swallowing a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can feed everything for a plateau.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own younger history and their own.
Battle against the drug mafia in the country
Police have successfully beaten the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor’s office Konstanz said on Friday.
Fifteen defendants aged between 25 and 77 have been arrested and have already issued warrants against them.
The officials also secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two people were arrested in Italy.
Against the two suspects, there were German arrest warrants.
Both of them are likely to be shipped to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were employed.
Members of the Mafia are charged with organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, as well as robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the Prosecutor’s Office has been investigating Konstanz against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a regular exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The aim of the investigations was mainly Italian nationals with a close connection to the Italian mafia.
Also, an incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired at a guest house early in the morning, is expected to go to the gang’s account.
Wisely regrets large gaps in the foreign register
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, Frank-Jürgen Weise, the commissioner for the federal government’s refugee management, drew attention to major gaps in the foreign central register.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "partly serious errors" in asylum procedures and dispatch, warned the South German newspaper in an analysis.
According to the register, 10 million people with foreign nationality are registered, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
Accordingly, the data is managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts has so far not been good.
In some cases, data from 1921 have been found "from people who have long since died, or from citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register".
“Incorrect data entry can significantly slow down return processes,” the report said.
Statistics on expatriate people also include EU citizens who do not have to leave.
Such false assignments, however, led to "a distorted debate on how to deal with outgoing people," the analysis says.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently started sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy when they have entered from there.
This is highlighted in an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper states that the BAMF has been conducting such procedures "in respect of families with children - except infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was virtually impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, the EU state is responsible for the refugees they reach first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
To justify this, the office now writes: "In the meantime, the admission capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has issued guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Internal political spokeswoman Ulla Jelpke criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatening human rights abuses and a threat to child welfare due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system."
Achieve the second best result
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach have already been made available to other people.
At least 12 of the citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all, Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community at the meeting of the municipality appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
“It’s great how our body is made for it and we should respect the donors who make their blood available to strangers, even more unnecessarily,” said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the head of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, as the cans are being broken down into their constituents.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
“This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors,” said the DRK Circuit Preparation Head.
Obviously, the move to the theater a few years ago led to a higher number of participants.
Already, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each.
Half of them are Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter give away 500 milliliters of their juice every ten times.
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have stifled speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “slow” as it retains interest rates on family income amid increasing pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) political decision-makers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members aiming for an increase this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the fall.
But she signaled that interest rate increases would be needed in the coming years to mitigate Brexit-induced inflation, and she said credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut Conjunction Package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from February next, although it has been said that it will now be expected to make <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more available under this system – with <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on real household income continues to burden consumption."
Among the interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" extent than the markets expected.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "step-by-step" and "limited".
The Bank’s downwardly adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the May forecasts.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news.
The pound fell by 0.5% to <0x24>1.31 and fell by 0.4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.11.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have eased expectations of an increase in interest rates and GDP rose from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly by the end of the year after the bank.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases, as the exacerbation will get worse at first before it improves.
She added that monetary policy could not "prevent income breakdowns in the coming years", but she added that wages will recover "clearly" by the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the growing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the interest rate cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for the price and the economy to reach it completely.
Prior to the bank’s last ruling on interest rates, the call for interest rates had increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers demanding a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% last month in June to 2.6%, although the bank said this was expected and will be attracted again in the coming months.
The bank said the exceedance in proportion to its 2% target was to be attributed "all" to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is expected to become more competitive again, as lenders are loudly looking for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and the new mortgages close, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to Prescribe Controversial HIV Drugs to 10,000 People
Patients will be given access to a “transformative” HIV prevention treatment in the NHS from September following a fight before the High Court against the funding of the drug.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service over a first three-year study of an estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself willing to finance the trial after the appellate court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court, according to which the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called it a "decisive moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a sequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are in question for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a doctor may also apply for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week after an internationally competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of how it is used, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and overcome the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive of NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and endangered people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We very much welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority must now be that the study will be conducted quickly across the country and that no one at risk for HIV will be left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been acquired, we are on the best path to protecting more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: “The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overwhelming after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our HIV prevention approach and the transmission of this life-changing infection can end.
This experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be conducted as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV, and that it will help us get one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.”
Living the Great Life: Intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, declined in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It’s located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – and it’s proof for the new design that Joanne didn’t pack and sell her bags.
"Before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
This apartment was shown to me in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely outdated.
Originally a one-room property with an enclosed layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirement,” she says.
For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively in order to solve the problem.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked over each other without having to bend.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, it was about putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function up or down.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height above each other - with a lot of extra drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all Joanne’s cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this one is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, furnished MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you slide the door, it slips very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, you’ll be selling the land – or how your property is valued,” Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the land."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help you create an emotional bond in a home,” Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can be transformed into something quite amazing by good design and increased square meters from something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
Brothers Fight for a <0x24>500 Million Real Estate Empire
Four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers find themselves in a mess over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over <0x24>500 million.
Former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a store in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for <0x24>85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and De Luti’s portfolio now includes downtown offices, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "the chief operator and the dominant personality" in the De Luti family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about a third.
A court record states that this means that Colin owns <0x24>316 million worth of property and Paul owns <0x24>176 million worth of property.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"Colin's proposed breakdowns left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place on Friday after several failed mediations.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business – of which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to end the dispute.
“My Italian heritage requires that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
Costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Luti and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family’s first jeans store.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to kindly pass on their property to their sons.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid <0x24>10 million and Luke <0x24>26 million when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark were, Paul says, "being bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin has been very restrained, although he was a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts.
“It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family names through the courts,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
“Our father didn’t want Paul and I to end up in our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “still hoped for a solution.”
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be settled by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to curb the president’s media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed it.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — in the hope of keeping the chief on a more uniform course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met on his first working day with senior officials, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that fell into the president’s hands.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow—whether on paper or in briefings—because the president would make better decisions if he received good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television dates back decades – and now that he’s in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“When candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he had received fair reporting from positions that were convincing,” former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control is, according to six former election campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a constant praise.”
- Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know about others – that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more explosives without their interventions.
We’ll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn’t send.
If his employees have managed to keep him away from trouble a few times, then their efforts have been worth it.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from sparking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, consisting of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - fully engaged in this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press releases, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is eager to figure out where these come from.
That’s exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet prosecutor Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of “being the source behind a bunch of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of scams, or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House Secretary-General, Rob Porter, "tryed to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram that Trump receives."
How'd that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most Wanted Criminals Get Post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped.
Police across Europe send (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the searched serious offenders are not naturally known, evidence from the population is expected and requested.
Europol reported on Friday the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" calendar of winter events.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, Europol said.
We have compiled 21 postcards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
Thirty-six of the online searches have so far been recovered, at least eleven of which are due to clues after publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate a grave and return to 'millionaire series'
Some of the most wealthy homeowners in the West Midlands are again standing up with some determined travelers on the foot of war who have negotiated one of the tombs pulled from the community to claim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull, called the "millionaire series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but weren’t deterred by a digging excavated by the Council to prevent their seizures.
The tactile group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have pressed Solihull’s council, saying it “is useless to deal with the problem.”
An anonymous resident said: "They were moved there on Monday night after being sent by Bentley Heath where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it was useless to deal with the problem.
Travellers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More came last night, probably even more tonight.”
She added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by keeping long lessons to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I’m not happy to continue paying my municipal taxes if the council can’t even stop it.”
A resident who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be robbed by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you’ve even seen a horse in the parking lot.”
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls police. We are taking the necessary legal steps to move on as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
Waldhotel Luise from Birkenhof
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Operationsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost, as well as revenues due to the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, given the dramatic increase in the number of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation to the county office, which resulted in controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the municipal council at the time.
But above all, the mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the location of the hotel and already spoke of serious interest in the house.
He should be right.
The group of Luisen hotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary ascent in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star plus category house under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Joy City object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
Their names are Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovation work will be undertaken.
The floors were cut out, ceilings were partially deconstructed, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building site.
There is still a lot to do by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in a conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be rebuilt in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautiful citizenry", as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out there."
Guests will benefit from a swimming pool, a wellness area and a meeting room.
You do not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a high level of downtown, she stresses.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wanted to expand, explains Scherer.
Whether individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, said Scherer.
The views of the city are similar to those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Less than a million euros, he said.
The outdoor plants are also brought to front man, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia Affair: U.S. Special Investigator Appoints Grand Jury
In Russia’s affair with US President Donald Trump, Special Investigator Robert Mueller reportedly used a so-called Grand Jury.
The committee has taken up the work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, calling on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper valued the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The broadcaster CNN reported that there were already first submissions by the committee in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of targeted interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Mueller is investigating whether there have been agreements between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigations are aimed at several men who acted as Republican advisers in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took Trump’s private and business environment into the limelight.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Special Investigator Trump had personally stepped into the center and investigated the charge as to whether the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the matter.
The main task of the Grand Jury is to examine existing evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to bring charges.
Grand Jurys are also called Prosecutors’ Chambers.
They are usually turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The committee can also be recruited by the Prosecutor’s Office to invite people under oath to be interrogated.
According to CNN, previews have already been issued, which are about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
The report said that people who had participated in the meeting had been called for a statement.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s advisers and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his then-election campaign chief Paul Manafort were also present.
Law experts said on U.S. television on Thursday evening that the move showed Mueller was not intimidated by his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will eventually be turned on to decide on the filing of a prosecution.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body of the beginning of a new phase of investigations is a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray Russia’s affairs as a campaign of his political opponents.
“The history of Russia is a total invention,” Trump said.
The theme gives Democrats a chance to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His Special Adviser, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But it also usually works in secret, he stressed.
The White House supported any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he will not be prosecuted against the president.
There is no reason to believe that something has changed, the statement said.
Mueller had only been employed after Trump fired Comey.
As a result of this ban on Trump, accusations were made that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigations against then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under a lot of pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media outlets, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his staff.
That triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent Congressional Special Investigator, such as in the Watergate affair about later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President's insistence from the Justice Department.
However, several senators from both sides want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday tabled bills, according to which the Special Investigator could no longer be dismissed as easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the western Antarctica, a giant iceberg is almost seven times the size of Berlin’s ice shelf.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The more than a trillion tons and 5,800 square kilometres of colossus now drives north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants ever recorded by researchers in the past three decades.
There is no danger to humans.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual ice shelf breaks in the region for about 30 years, the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
In the opinion of many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossal was so far part of the Larsen C-Shelf.
Shelffish swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
Thus, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen C Shelf is located south of South America at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.
To the north of this shelf, the balance of growth and breakdown was disrupted a few years ago.
A complete shelffish was broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C shellfish is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far back as it is now.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can break down if a piece breaks down at a key point.
Melting ice and iceberg does not raise sea level as they swim on water and displace ice as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of shellfish causes the glaciers to go directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could potentially raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for observing Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI, the Larsen C Shelf is the fourth-largest Shelf in Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometers.
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down there regularly.
“While it’s a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position,” said Martin O’Leary of the University of Swansea.
"This is the longest retreat since the beginning of the recordings," he also confirmed.
Scientists have disputed whether the Larsen-C-shelf will now grow again or fall back in the long run and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will last for decades.
Although these researchers do not account for the demise of this giant iceberg due to climate change, many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades.
This long ridge of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperatures rise the fastest.
The CDU wants to make a personal tax
As it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacancies, the CDU is calling on the CDU to step out of the employers’ union to become more attractive.
Shortly before the summer break, the county has won 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.
The teaching positions in the circle are apparently very desirable.
Approximately 620 applications were to be registered for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to meet the increased demands and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unoccupied positions in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as the powers of the general administration are sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the district council and to counter the shortage of specialists in the administration.
The administration is to develop a “concept for the recruitment and development of personnel” at the request of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals, but to counter future-oriented candidate shortages, it says.
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, show concrete measures for cross-country climbers and include a training offensive, CDU, FDP and UWG demands.
This sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that we didn’t know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, there is a high number of employees who are excluded from the service due to illness or age.
It is high time to act, so that no more jobs remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU faction, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
Recently, he made a big surprise in the county, when he publicly questioned the staff cost coverage and shocked the other parties.
Peoples want all the possibilities that will allow them to leave the municipal employers’ union.
"If we don't come here in the short term to a satisfactory solution, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-owned cities," Volker said.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service tariff actually provides.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, there are increases or more money only if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
It was only a few weeks ago that new rooms had to be set up, where employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitutes Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy Strengthens Tone of NGO Migrant Rescue Boats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to do so unless they adhere to new rules for their operations.
“If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German aid organization "Jugend Rettet" because their crew had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“Saving human lives is and will continue to be our top priority for us, so we are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue zone,” the organization said in a statement to social media.
“We can only assess all the charges currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Rescue', which Iuventa has been monitoring since October.
It is suspected that its crew will take on board hoseboat migrants delivered directly from human traffickers, and that smugglers can take off so that the ships can be reused.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor’s file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must primarily have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue efforts have so far declared themselves ready to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring about "substantial changes or disabilities" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libya’s coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have been fruitful.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Increases and trials
Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
There were three friendly guides available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Castle and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelkapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
It was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzer forest and the pre-lagged plains.
In between, there were always longer increases, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, point of view reached point of view, combined by "flowing" trials and moderate increases.
During the last two days, many meters of elevation were made again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and invertebrates brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing soles in the open-air inhaler.
New Town is also under control.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4,500 meters of altitude, the group had known the Pfälzer Forest from its best - sporting and cultural - side.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sports
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating in the wind and weather over the stadium races?
The fact is: e-sports has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business – including big stars, millions of fans and huge high-speed tournaments.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga associations that are increasingly engaged in this area.
The start was made in 2015 by VfL Wolfsburg, followed by FC Schalke 04 and lastly by VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "there are still a number of clubs on this train."
This weekend, FIFA World Cup will host the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where players from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual footballers.
"Real football, in particular, has to deal with the 14- to 30-year-olds, that the young people still go to the stadium in the future," the 52-year-old says.
And: The associations tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sports players under contract, you could be online much more likely to be present in these markets than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is this about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or FIFA football simulation are played on a competitive level.
Recently, as in normal sports, leagues have been established, in which the professionals face each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
Is this a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly accustomed.
Ingo Frob<0xC3><0xB8>se has also been dealing with the issue for a long time.
For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports – for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding, and a rapid reactivity.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Frob<0xC3><0xB8>se also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were lacking.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are internationally on the move, which is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte Consulting and the Federal Federation of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sports.
In 2016, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million was spent in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
Against the nearly 2.4 billion Euros of the Bundesliga, that is little.
However, e-sports is “not far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey,” the Deloitte advisors write.
Internationally, many countries have already gone on.
Large markets are Asia and the US, where former basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports was introduced as a subject of instruction, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the football leagues are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In European comparison, Germany is backwards," explains VfB Board of Directors Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to clear up the old days, is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company to the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” Dutt says.
“There’s no point in saying that only in football everything remains the way it always was.”
Gift egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are affected by the egg-loading scandal.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and taken all the eggs from the sale across Germany.
Only eggs that do not contain fipronil are to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter Convicted of the Texts That Push Conrad Roy to Suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been put on trial.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent murder by Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing on Thursday: “My family is uncomfortable.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the call.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and downwards eyes when she was convicted.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended her life to make her own better.
She did not take any responsibility,” she said.
"She has not shown remorse".
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “horrible circumstance that she totally regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant influence on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy’s mother Lynn Roy, who said that “there is no day when I don’t mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain we will bear with us forever.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she would be "followed" by the discovery that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
“Not having this one person I’ve been with every day since I was born is a pain that I’ll always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask someone else to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car in 2014 due to carbon monoxide poisoning.
The case drew national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump out of a building, kick yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent her in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before he committed suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British compatriot in Italy in 2007 before being released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern’s new mini-lahm
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as captain is no coincidence.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner with a big season – extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer, so he held on to his arm the tie assigned to him.
"The coach hasn't announced it," said the Confed Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bayern captain.
Well, the record could have been better than 0:2 against SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also mean Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been selected as the leader of the C-Elf from the youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come from the holidays, but he.
Zuckerl is best distributed to those who have a lot of confidence to keep in touch with Laune.
So those who have been chosen to join the legacy of lahm can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-lahm.
Right behind, that's his position, the white band on the arm did the rest.
And at all, Kimmich worked in this startup formation just like the one who can take the rudder in the best hands.
He gave instructions, trying to lead the unplayed troops.
He had the look for the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (almost clapped); Renato Sanches with clapping out on devils to the achievements of the Asia-travel (almost only clapped on condition); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not negative in their first appearance in the Bayern Trikot.
After all, it worked very well.
Soul ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The famous Naples storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to build the game a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not what we expected."
But he also showed a decent performance during his debut.
Game shift, pace change: "For this style, I was also brought in."
How unusual this Bavaria world is for the new arrivals is, it was later seen at the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two catacombs, but definitely six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
With Bavaria, you just have to win every game.”
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivated UFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies
Austria’s best-known footballer reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies all the best.
The Bayern Legionary is almost a club colleague of <0xC3><0x96>FB-Captain Schnaderbeck and has a fever with our lady.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
Perhaps our ladies might need the famous Bavarian dusel as well.
Companies satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This comes after more than a year when the new Economy Minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak at the request of T-V about a change in economic policy - and at the same time tadel the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says, "Wissing is attacking the wishes of the economy, which has blocked Lemke altogether".
Natus sees the biggest turning point in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
Still this year, the ministry hopes to have a plan-making process, which is expected to stand by the construction law by 2021.
The western circumvention of Trier also plays a role in the country’s plans, which is the priority requirement of the Federal roadmap.
The aim is to start the route in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a way to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier aims, as encouraged by Wissing, to impose a Rhineland-Palatinate label on wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports, which has been declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 is provided for the master’s exam and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,500 if graduates become self-employed within ten years of master’s training.
However, the list of homework for the country remains long.
With the planned road construction, facts can be quickly created, while the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive officer of IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing for mobility in the country, only 29 have been employed so far.
The IHK demands that more contracts be awarded to external offices.
CDU faction visa Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country investing more than 20 million euros less in receiving roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus is also waiting for a concept of the country to address the shortage of specialists in the region.
The up-to-date broadband expansion in the country is also exciting.
In 2016, regional companies only rated the power supply with a rating of 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about staggering internet connections and interruptions.
Former Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe, where she had already left the field after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles – car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
A day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes that "it gives smarter options than driving restrictions" and thus referred to European cities - including Munich where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the business as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with carbon emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of installing systems for the neutralisation of the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increases, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of mocking the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s errors that were able to regulate the use of so-called switch-off devices to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but returned under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be a burden to Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is contributing overproportionally to Volkswagen’s profits.
This message has the river on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to join the Isar visitors, on Saturday, a river runs through Munich, which has a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large river there between Flaucher and Reichenbach Bridge.
And this is not an ordinary boat, with Isar tourists.
But the construction team wants to clarify.
On the river you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The launch of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is..." the understanding of the Isar as a protective wildflower should be sharpened.
Already last summer, the river crossed the Isar and this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Murderless tummy noses and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was one of the most published cartoon characters, the tubular noses of his figures are his trademark.
At the age of 85, the Argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of a Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In his early years as an artist, he succeeded, among other things, as a cartoonist for greeting cards – which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job,” he said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he broke through the late 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artists of cities were inspired.
Large, round Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the slippery Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
Early in the morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the drawing desk today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, t-shirts, plush animals and watches, his stunning figures continue to find widespread worldwide.
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordilo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-footer as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is set to come to the cinema in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That’s why he’s more likely to rely on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and insects transmitting diseases, which causes great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an effect on the life of lavender.
There is also a small zikade, a microbacteria that transmits dwarf zikades, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil is not only attractive for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, “Instead of having very long plant strings with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions to be considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of tone and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Tyrrhenian region celebrates its 1200th anniversary.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Creams, nuns, dealers, vagabonds or a country slave camp are supposed to be experienced in downtown on these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The Riodoce weekly staff usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans to report on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing what feels safer: taking their children to the office who were the targets of a grenade attack in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, enough perceptions and abdominal feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalog of criminals making the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no break from violence, and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far, at least they have died this year.
Among the latter is her publisher and inspiration of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, typing his face, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, with his t-shirts, his t-shirts, his t-shirts, his
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to handle cases of journalists, it has only opened two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, journalists’ murders are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are reckless and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security is of little use, Ibarra says.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we're all suspicious."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions here struggle to fill the void.
It doesn’t matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is guilty of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzmán’s sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez, after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story, to leave the country for his own safety.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold <0x24>50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to practice journalism without encountering the tobacco problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for its courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-working investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever she led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You have to take on the task that happens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I don’t want to be asked, “What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why haven’t you told me what happened?”
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird that could curse like a harbor worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trust their routines.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine ruined?
His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you’re dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and landing tracks,” to move drugs.
"These things weren't allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result is, even at the best times, a high degree of self-esteem and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, that "the smell of a sense that can be fooled...and then the thing has happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, do not apply in Sinaloa anymore - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce’s employees met for security training, suddenly no phones were allowed. Days earlier it was known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 <0xC2><0xB0> C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect Riodoce’s offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in a joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It’s been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition on state spending, which focused on the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group carrying out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was given when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been charged with high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this location, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.
Just a few months earlier, the readers would have considered Valdez’s column to be the best informed source of the kidnapping.
"Earlier we knew what had happened," Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body structure.
"Now all the channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been transformed into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murder of journalists because employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to the prosecutor’s office for a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, it’s his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing down “SOS Press” on streets and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is off in Washington, DC, trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez’s murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and letting them kill them for telling the truth.
She has since requested that the government reorganize her because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also by the command of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organized crime.
The media watchdog "Article 19" has attributed more than half of the attacks last year to police journalists and officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a dissuasive effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslav Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a guide article on the title page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even their country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it appears to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking frightens him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
By midnight last Friday, when the last edition had already ended, Riodoce’s editors were sitting on the street in front of the office, drinking beer, as all of a sudden they began to sum up all their phones.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the edge of the stone, they published the news on Riodoce’s website via mobile.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens were blazing nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who were guarding to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they didn’t show it.
Under the huge portrait of the newspaper’s fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, Riodoce’s employees followed in his footsteps.
"How can you just remember," Bojorquez said, "if the same day that Javier was murdered, the trainee asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used Tarning to evade their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Researchers have now found that the first findings of a Canadian miner’s incredible rhino were so well preserved that experts have described it as “Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.”
It was so well-preserved that they could even notice that his scary skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a "unruly past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The Fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurians that lived in the mid-Credit period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers describing it as "really remarkable".
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant feeder is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He encountered something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock in place, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clusters.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you just blink with your eyes a little bit, you could almost believe it’s asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will enter science history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant-eater, although covered with an armor and resembling a changing tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white tarnish to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurian family made headlines in May and is now visible at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of skulls and armor over his body.
They discovered counter-shading, a widespread method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopella far exceeds that of today’s living animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading – think of reefs, zebras, or belt animals – are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaurier was subjected to a real fight for survival.
"Strict predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut content, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was thrown into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank to the sea floor on his back.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.
You don’t need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it, and if you just shake your eyes a little bit, you might almost think he’s asleep.”
The Creation era was a time when giant theropods, flesh-eating dinosaurs, stood on two legs, traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopella, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopella was hung in the sea and mummified in mud after death.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the skull to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that ran from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant feeder was floated through western Canada until a flooded river floated it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater fortress preserved his weaponry in exquisite detail.
The stoned remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the others still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a lottery win.
The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the animal’s skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the shells on his sole.”
In the storm: mass combo on A8: Many Injured
Violent accident on Thursday night on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carpooling.
There are numerous injured, miles long stalls - and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) at the end of Thursday afternoon, about 20 people were injured in a mass assembly.
According to the first police report, at around 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg Landkreis) connections, nearly 30 vehicles, probably trucks, were collided during a thunderstorm.
Initially, there was no information on the exact number of injured.
These are mild to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were on the scene.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the driving direction Munich formed a ten-kilometre-long retreat.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive disabilities on the runway - through numerous gaffers.
The fire department noted the identification of the drivers, who now have to face sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car carrier and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing imagining you’re sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you’re deep in your work and you just have a brilliant thought.
And then: Puff.
If the opener comes and wakes up an awkward or scratches the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket controls.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unmanned ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you have taken your seat and thus devalue the ticket.
Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.
“If the offer comes up, we’ll expand it.
It will then be expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany,” said a train spokesman.
"Comfort check-in" refers to the ticket assessment without an opener.
However, in order to be able to use it, a few prerequisites must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers do anyway.
You must also use the app of the train that DB Navigator bought, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
Lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic evaluation will then appear to the test customer.
The train escorts receive on their mobile devices a message that Passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.
If the train driver arrives at Y-Place, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
You can go to sleep, work, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is to be used by the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control through our train escort staff, simply check in in the DB Navigator yourself.
This enables passengers to make their travel time on the train more personalized,” says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director at DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than they do today to address individual customer needs."
Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are one of the biggest problems.
Because often you have yourself, but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documentation you need to depreciate online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you need to present.
The result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the department or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket, and the creator eventually takes time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And this is only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been unlocked.
How did an activist learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to its core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis-born woman sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
“The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it’s still on the street,” he said.
Confused as no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle <0x40>TheePharoah has been retweeted constantly on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown’s dead body that had been stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
“That’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped off her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police gang and the people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown’s father, wearing a sign with the inscription: “Ferguson’s police just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a beating dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman secured his gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"That's not normal," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we're used to and that we can typically call."
At that moment, I felt frozen.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father’s house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from the 11th century.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had had innumerable times before that morning "about the black experience and the black condition".
“Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?” she recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn’t take it with me,” Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well-developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to be free to liberate ourselves.
Although I am fortunate to give her an experience where she does not personally experience eccentric racism, she is no different than the next black woman child.
I feel like I would do a bad service to her to keep her out of it.”
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police, which became a campground when the activists awaited the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared pockets and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
“My activism has completely changed since August 9th,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It's all here."
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were just trying to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell’s mind: “Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?”
This skepticism was nurtured by countless cases of people, often white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: “We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death-straight inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team from "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. We're talking," Davis said.
“That was the main thing for me how these people are represented, because that is how I will be represented.”
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience – to show that the movement “is not a Messiah leader, but a community that gathers,” Folayan said – she turned out to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
“But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, have branded the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
“Black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything.”
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really being maintained by black women and many black women".
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to her identity.
“She was the person who stirred this energy,” she said.
“It’s not a coincidence that she was on the front line because there’s so much at stake in a life at these crossroads as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racist connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell has been on trial for 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years for blocking a motorway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "A Chaos".
Still, she clings to a song and feels committed to that memory since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "dream" to "size wahn": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people even though it hasn’t been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center on the south of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
It’s cold enough to leave the subject alone.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreud Bitburg".
While the one on the bit gallery says, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really cool" (Nicole Schausten), the other comes from: "Don't smoke a person" (Siggi Betten) or simply: "Size Wahnsinn!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, which also benefits the rest of the stores, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery will be planned exactly on the property where the Farmer Market Hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work, this will be the end.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping almost weekly in the Farmers' Market Hall for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the women of the country again and again very much like.
We have also discovered the dairy for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, there are also.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, it depends on the level of rent.
However, they are not likely to be very low in the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why Shopping Palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is enough of this in our city.
You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.
But since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, most of it is offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping mall are rented only by larger companies, as the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no specialty stores and what remains of them will probably disappear as well.”
Wolf Fandel: “A mall with a market hall is not right for me.
And the gallery does not fit Bitburg.
First and foremost, where should the Farmer Market Hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even for a long time, when the bit gallery is actually coming at some point.
Or does the Ghost Bit-Gallery manage to sell all the stores from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And a shopping mall that is empty doesn’t need anyone either.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer market, rather than this gallery.
But thanks to the insanely many - as I think - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no room for a farm market hall.
If the peasant market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A matching resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York you can see many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after she released classified diplomatic reports via the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Ressemblance.
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and leading dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone might look with these genomic data, has sharpened, albeit some intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted, but also on this terminology and interference.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly since her puberty about identifying as a woman, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie, in which Manning was apparently uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project ‘Stranger Visions’.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stump and gum, extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like.
That was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became inequal letters friends, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book “Supressed Images” illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelsea’s judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama would demand the release of Manning after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong about the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is fighting a war against informants from the government camp and transgender troops to find new, secondary ways to further flare up the rigid divisions he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that “things happen for a certain reason.”
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to "automatic division, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture," with her oversized signature.
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least biologically, we are all, by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist’s highly developed scientific dictionary).
"What we hope people will take with them is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also visible.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic-novel.
She shows Manning how she emerges from the United States disciplinary departments such as King-Kong with a hands-free phone.
"If they cool your speech, they've won," it says.
"So never keep your mouth shut".
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greeted her from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition – as it was predicted in the comic book – but if she should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulators, which collide like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5", 2, Manning's Stature), where their genetic haplo groups were pencil-written.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation.”
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University Employee Searched for Murder
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are being searched for as a suspect after a man was stabbed in a luxurious Chicago apartment with deadly injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder over their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as evidenced by the files of the Cook County District Court.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead on the scene, and detectives are investigating the stain as a murder, while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now in permission and has been excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
“This is now a criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with this investigation,” said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help U.S. intelligence agencies in any conceivable way."
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
“The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, saying something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team released a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will conclude the WADA Roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
“At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA’s roadmap for compliance with the code, which outlines the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the WADA website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause Russia to worry.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria outlined in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
Mutko said: “We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has found an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit anything that doesn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In a conversation with the Russian outlet RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from conducting doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as a result of the WADA doping scandal.
However, they were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is “moving in the right direction” to be reused.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was reported by the company groups.
It is a pure precautionary measure, it cannot be assumed that there is no further health impairment, the statement said.

The Startups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employees’ happiness in your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or – worse – fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There's just never been consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She's been calling for help from outside.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to carry out surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaints hotlines, and in some cases to provide advice on complaints and complaints.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to engage employees.
Errett said they gained a better understanding of what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can dig out why.
Companies are coming to realize that they need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so you don’t become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were threatened.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance industry could be worth more than <0x24>118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial tech website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convert, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity early this year amid the Uber fall in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has seized the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, Convercent’s founder and CEO.
If a company is found to be treating its employees badly or behaving unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee fluctuation, and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email to the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and an uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track complaints from employees.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states — such as discrimination, harassment, or unfamiliar practices — can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment,” said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"And we are protecting our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the “social media came to their right” that companies realized that they couldn’t prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before the use of technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convertent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received <0x24>10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to <0x24>47 million.
Glitzern secured <0x24>10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to <0x24>60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to be in a company, feeling that their voices belong, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience, who also uses LinkedIn as a partner.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the analytics tools promise third parties to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder that you’ll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it can have a expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change isn’t coming fast enough, or not at all, it can create disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kotter International, which has seen companies relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t follow, employees will ask, ‘Have you really heard me?
Do you care about it?
And who doesn’t care, why should I?”
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day when a Glint issue is reported.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company due to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, adding a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is always getting new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bond of employees in an industry that is known for high sales.
“If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practice and makes a long day for the bruins
It will take place at 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are entertained on one side of the team’s new field of practice on campus.
Some have pulled out their tricots and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after three hours of practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA is eliminating two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days – at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA training sessions should begin at 7:15 p.m. to meet the players’ already fully packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and performed practical exercises for the first time during Moras’s six game seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises in August, 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA’s change of rules, even if it adds another point to the busy routes of the players.
“We put this huge burden on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they're sticking on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we arrive by Saturday and we have more time, it'll be really great."
The UCLA will end its internships once the camp is finished, which will not be easy given the clear vision of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been pitched with soccer balls, a protective net behind a gate.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
“We will use our security,” Mora said.
“That’s a real problem, and it’s not that hard to think that people are renting a room there and then setting themselves up there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces in there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
That's why I don't worry too much.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake messages to third-party fact-checkers and display their results under the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible fake messages and send them to fact-checkers, which may display the results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they have also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly avoid the hateful posts in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a new fact-checking test will be launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to understanding what stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,” said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "connected article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In its recent past, the little Scotney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music video and was a slippery slope for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mofarious Yorkshireman with a passion for historical documents.
“I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he says.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Edward Ages and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes’ first book based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 ‘Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories’, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library – a project he unexpectedly found emotional.
“I’ve only responded to the thumbprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jakobiners,” he says.
"That's his daumy print!
And letters always smelled like smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself was there.
“I love the archives!”
For someone who is hit with such old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I overestimated my welcome a bit"), it seems all too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, reviewing the archives, and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyenas heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tomb.
He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes even to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown as the National Trust did not gain full access until 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just starting to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it on the rooftop."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who possessed something: "You might think land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a Birke for which two families had fought.
Guys, let it all go!”
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse itself in English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the builder's uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
“The construction uprising started in this area and I thought a uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected to each other?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle – such as ‘The Priest’, which tells the story of the Jesuit father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which depicts 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed quite greedy, repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women—I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys with a talent to promote bonds.”
After the end of its use in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic book about Elömänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign Launched: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf
With the disguise of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new roof mark (Tuesday's round show).
By Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz will keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as a highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or?", the creators of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhondorf Chapel.
“We don’t really think that (of course!),” they wrote on their unlocked website yesterday.
"But we're using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as citizens of Bad Honnefer we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is more than just a logo and a slogan.
"It is necessary to make a solitary promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable characteristic of solitude".
Finally, they are competing with other municipalities.
A medium five-digit sum will cost the city of Bad Honnef its new roof mark and the campaign.
Turkey's military reforms - Erdogan's fear of the army
Each year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and promotions in the Officers’ Corps in Ankara.
Also this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish military a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consultations under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.
The civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government is pulling the rails in the military.
Although Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, the commanders of the Army, Air Force and Navy were deposed.
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army – mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as a wire-tighter of the coup attempt.
486 people, who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt, have been negotiating in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the coup attempt as a “gift of God” as giving him the opportunity to “completely clean” the forces.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriet" published an article entitled "Discomfort in the military headquarters".
In the General Staff there are concerns about the increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the ban on headaches for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the great cleansing of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan fired another 7395 civil servants by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It was as if Erdogan had insulted the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the actual lords of the country.
Three times they called for their role as guardians of the world state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the military’s power step by step, not least by calling for the European Union’s reform agenda.
Former officers say Erdogan is targeting an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum overseas after the coup attempt warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this happens, such a development could not make NATO cold.
After the clearings, however, the Alliance has doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army to take action.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weaken,” NATO diplomats say.
Washington to change the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, citing the media.
He plans to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter visa requirements for a fixed-term work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the U.S. is spending green cards on citizens from other countries.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves, and who show the knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
Ministry wants to renovate route for racing shuttle
Over the past few months, the future of the racing shuttle has been debated again and again - now it is expected to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it will be built on the maroden route on which the tourist track runs.
In order to secure the future of the racing shuttle in the long term, the Ministry of Transport is expected to begin construction on the track this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renewing the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country acknowledges this connection that is especially important for tourism," Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl said on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of restoring the route amounted to approximately 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalized, Sühl said.
The Ministry and the South Tyrolean Railway as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
"This negotiated the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the racing-shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular train connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig train stations.
Over the past few months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also highly constructed in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as you thought that 2017 could not get even more crazy, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
“People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we’ll get to see them much more often,” Mr. Sharkey said in a statement.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more worrying as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone leather.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find attractive, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," the True Companion website said.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn’t like what you don’t like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day – just like real people!
She may be tired, fixed on conversation, or she may be “in the mood.”
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female traits, the allegations of rape, when you step on frigid (he says here: resistant) Farrah agrees with me.
On his website he compared True Companion Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?"
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just hold another sex toy.
Their origin and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices its growing popularity, they still remain temporarily on the edge of consumer culture.
But what comes out of the periphery can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
However, there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots emerge at a time when women’s rights are under threat worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has spoken out to have sexually assaulted women.
The most terrifying aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Madonna') is not the graphic images, the blurred body and the blurred eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn’t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel humanly imitating the movement of a real body.
But, to the point when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
You can’t separate from your partner or just leave.
They have no mediation or background, nothing suggesting independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total subjugation.
In other words, they are kind slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: maid
Trump’s great accomplishment?
He Makes Mitt Romney Ingredients of Healthy Mental Intelligence
It has become a common misconception of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized U.S. electorate have also divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s electing relatives.
We're all supposed to strangle ourselves to let our filter bubbles splatter.
Less has been noticed Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
Around the dining table is certainly a good thing, but I notice in another context that this also brings with it significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disastrous effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the terrible possibility that one day his mates will no longer reject us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans, which suddenly appear as a concept of reasonableness in comparison to his standards.
I find myself nowadays plagued by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s urcomic version of the madman – the dog on the roof of the car that was 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which are in fact a very mild crime compared to Trump.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate must be mentally healthy only to qualify as an immense improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are crooked and the animals twist to look fearful over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not meet the dream.
Fifty-three years later, and I’m still not completely gone by the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not actually a Swiss Cottage – the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count – but a large circular traffic in northern London.
However, the Central Park Karussell is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, I was forced this week in a mall to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to offset the rating with a 15% drinking fee - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where it is not necessary.
The poor lady in the mall was apologeticly laughing, while I was tired of the experience of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a visit to the hospital.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he suffered from the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 by shooting at her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to impose the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too cautious.
The National Criminal Prosecution Authority said it would raise an objection to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg Schools, the fourth graders from Futzen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and to the further schools.
Three of the graduating students will go to high school in the future, four to real school.
Teacher Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday night.
As a symbol for the school release, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm, but then is released.
In addition, the braver shawl performed a musical titled "The Eagle in the Chicken Court".
Bauer Arnold found an odd egg, and let it germinate from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was broken, and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain, and fled.
Afterwards, the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank’s study.
The hens danced with the young gobblers who wore cylinders to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (Küken), but belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he would feel accepted in his new school.
It followed thanks to colleagues, former head of school Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumped into school passports, and the parents’ representatives.
The puppy time is over, class teacher Sophia Schumacher said.
She leaves her students after two years of school only very unwilling, because it had been a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
Finally, all students made a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy among the children.
Eight first-class students are already enrolled for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a televised statement.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegal tenting people, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in Sithonia.
They were released on the same day, while an investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of the free camps and impose substantial fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the entire season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Updates for Diesel Vehicles: What Stakeholders Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers need to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and Euro 6 in part.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives ratings:
Is the new action compulsory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
“The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have scumbag software,” says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofit has been arranged by the Federal Bureau of Transportation (KBA).
How and when will customers be notified of updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have yet to specify an exact date.
Daimler has notified all affected persons.
Anyway, if an inspection is due, it will be carried out within the framework of it.
How long are the rearrangements expected to last?
"It's hard to say," Smetanin says.
This depends on the commitment of the producers as well as the political pressure.
“We have seen that the car manufacturers have not voluntarily taken action on the issue of the environment so far.”
How long will the update take?
The rearrangement itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who don’t drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Probably foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there a massive price drop for Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But in the regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the winners doesn’t want to come – out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honoured.
The awards will be presented in early December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The award-winning Lear, known for progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not participate in the Gala.
The New York Times said: “This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even to take away the funds – and that burdens me.”
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach’s city builder, will retire next year.
The job is already outlined - but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work still makes him a lot of fun, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports of varied but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application meets the requirement profile so far.
The city is looking for an architect or a construction engineer as soon as possible.
Thus - taking into account the regular termination periods - there should still be enough time for incorporation.
Since Haslach acts as a lower building authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present the appropriate conclusions.
Because this function will definitely keep the city.
If they were no longer able to fill these, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to citizens is important to the city and to itself, says Wacker, who reports a good operating climate and good mood between the authorities and citizens.
For more than 30 years in office, several important projects have gathered, which Wacker is proud to look back on.
"We make the city worth living," he is confident about the building office and his employees.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the restructuring of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot have been pushed around.
The Kinzi bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
Only the latter will be hit with about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
Designerically, there is a large play area for a city builder.
With Haslach’s own building and gardening, many can be reacted quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of the greenhouses is often mentioned with praise by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is under monumental protection as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the separate city architect stresses.
In any case, the city builder has a high responsibility.
He's the builder, "in the end everything is running over my table."
In terms of care and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (high-rise building) has been with him for ten years, Manfred Schöner (deep-rise building) has been with him for 15 years.
Also, that his successor stays long, Wacker wishes: “We are looking for someone who really wants to identify with the position and stay.”
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to bury Roland Wacker, the city of Haslach should be able to show a graduate degree as a diploma engineer or bachelor with a degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction planning and planning law.
The City Building Office is responsible for high and low-rise construction, construction planning, land-based business matters, the administration of urban property, the City Operating Court with construction and urban gardening, as well as the Lower Building Law Authority including monumental protection.
Bicycle thrown on cables: Southern trail blocked
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad transmission in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the pipelines.
These were so severely damaged that the contiguous freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators come from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night.
Near the scene, witnesses observed a pink roller and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a loudspeaker," <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch told APA.
The perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered the train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement traffic, the perpetrators could also receive penalties from railway customers.
In general, it should be based on a “significant” sum, the spokesman said.
The damage was repaired again on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern track could be carried out without disabilities.
Almost ten passenger trains had crashed on Friday morning, two of which affected long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were late.
According to <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of cables had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (Inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The unhealing condition, which affects about 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan helps proteins develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patroll in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it has been found that some type of immune cell that promotes tolerance occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intravenous tissues.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of protein - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have made a connection between a bacterial species – Lactobacillus reuteri – that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells.”
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel environments, if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoralist Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was separated, did not.
She suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequencing and six species of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid – without the bacteria – to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-milic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea’s <0xC2><0xA3>40 million signing began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira advanced at will.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Blues’ preparations for the Asia Tour and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted needed to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He takes time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, for that I thank the club," he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they’ve made a lot of effort.”
Boeing "painted" dreamliner in the sky
U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew off from Seattle, Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and took the form of a dreamliner over the United States, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was to be the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a test of endurance for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising before.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New deep blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief, the Social Democratic prime ministers were always looking at Berlin with some concern before the election.
Only no disturbance from the party headquarters, just no counterwind from the union – so was the most important wish of the voters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-House have watched the events in the SPD-regulated country capitals with growing fear.
What Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not even have been described in the approach.
There were deep blows.
And one after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot reliably govern," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the German editorial network (RND).
The surprise faction exit of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the election, his red-green coalition lost its unanimous majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
Greens Federal CEO Michael Kellner has called on Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to resign his mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the electorate’s will.
Every West must immediately return its mandate,” the Federal Director and campaign leader of the Greens told the editorial network Germany (RND).
"That must not be true at all," said an SPD voter, as the new Jobs message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Minister-President of Lower Saxony, is there after the passing of Green MEPs Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of major and minor crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The misfortune began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed the comrades of his time.
After the national elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That was also the case – and everything got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the halt, the Düsseldorf Pleite smoothly killed the party.
Tiredly, the comrades reappeared in the following weeks.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next deep blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD land chief, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communication, he did pretty much everything wrong that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
And then there's Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW abgas issue and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
The surveys have been added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps just for that reason, Weil has been trying to put more and more emphasis on the alliance in recent weeks.
The attempt by the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin also remained unconcealed by comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They let him go because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Because there is basically no fault in the party-internal dispute of the Lower Saxon Greens.
And not at all Schulz.
Sometimes the comrades try to keep their own rows closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and above all at the rebellious parliamentarian Twest.
“It is unbearable and democratically damaging how Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else,” says Matthias Miersch, head of the party in the SPD-Bundestagsgruppe, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but because of the country's list of Lower Saxon Greens, the Lower Saxon MEP continued.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag faction, complains of an "undemocratic maneuver".
“The voter turnout four years ago was clear: the people have made Stephan Weil prime minister,” says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestagswahlen, the RND.
"Now the personal career idea of a future CDU member fakes the election result," Oppermann continued.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know whether there have been more or there have been further commitments made by the CDU in Lower Saxony.
Grants for Local Corps III
Anyone who wants to renovate a house that has come into the years can soon receive support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development were informed on Wednesday in Receptioningen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back on what had happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been rehabilitation areas in Receptioningen.
At that time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60%.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - after all, it is important to also promote interior development, and not just to open new construction areas.
On April 4, the government Presidency of Karlsruhe was informed that there would be a renovation area III.
The funding amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500,000 euros come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Receptioningen.
How is a rehabilitation area now created?
Schindler said that we will continue to investigate where the “real old” houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in rehabilitation in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again.
The STEGs represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the contents of the Bundesland program "Social City", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions, and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out subject to object, i.e. per plot.
Finally, the area of rehabilitation would be defined as a statute.
The allowance period for the funding funds runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory will only be carried out once, in the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire to be completed.
The statutory decision is to be taken in November or December, as far as possible, so that the reforms can be started next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It’s about assessing the urban misfortunes and deciding when and to what extent they will be remodeled.
A renewal note will then be entered in the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come to reception again and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the involvement of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and property arc", which deals, among other things, with the construction status and the renovation plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Household and Housing Arc", information on the size, division and inhabitants of a living room can be made.
The blue "operating arc" is only to be filled when operating business premises in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds according to the "wind dog principle" works - who comes first, melts first.
You can’t “reserve” funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortkern II" were shown to make the attendee a renovation "flavorful".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come home and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so he can open his door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra fee of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
Advertising costs of the White House cost taxpayers thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn for an event highlighting U.S. manufacturing last month cost taxpayers up to <0x24>24,000, according to the military, which was left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine, a firefighter from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit for the operation of the helicopter.
“I just wanted you to be aware of this because it’s such an unusual event with high visibility,” the HMX-1 commander wrote to his chief, the Deputy Marine Commander for Aviation, on the eve of the event.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m., and remained so long until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 2 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
From the records made available to TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision.
“A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,” the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're locked up," answered the deputy commander.
The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But demanding their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an inquiry in February when the presidential plane, against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, provided taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential plane by its predecessors.
"The White House is thrilled with the show "Made in America" - showcasing products from all 50 states made by American workers with American materials," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights around Washington and South Lawn to deploy the U.S. president in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the training requirement of the flight crew for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for "non-presidency support missions".
The White House said the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other requirements presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for Presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the U.S. Department of Defense’s hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is <0x24>24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.
“Determining the costs for taxpayers based on the estimates for the reimbursement rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include staff costs, but rather take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At that time, the former White House press spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present things that are made in America this week,” Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be contributing to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this.”
It wasn’t clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before a difficult task
The top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga will join the table runners-up Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will arrive tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel at the Suchsdorfer SV table route.
Despite five matches still impeccable balance, the leader of the second Bundesliga has gained a sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation.
On the rear positions, I find the team very well.”
For class and stability in the Suchsdorfer SV mainly imports from the high north.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to Davis Cup bets.
And they are also strong in the double," says Zay with a look at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It's going to be hard for us, as always.
You also need a good portion of luck.”
The new team for the trip to the High North is practical.
His debut for blue-white could be Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman currently active in the challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, fails to join the Bundesliga, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who plays in the tournament in Liberec, Czech Republic, will make his first debut this season.
The invincible Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the ball.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at Alster, Máté Valkusz could join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still number one in the Junior World Rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay will fill the frame.
How the U.S. can harm the U.S.
Really, Donald Trump didn’t seem happy when he signed under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his hatred of passing the law," Congress has packaged some "unconstitutional rules" in it, he said.
Also, the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was foaming against the U.S. lead.
After all, the draft plans to punish European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors from the domestic OMV, which co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies, have been concerned.
The drought scene is huge.
However, it is too early for an estimate of the consequences, according to the oil group’s official statement.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions back to life by executive order.
There are 12 guns to choose from.
"The press" has looked at which could deter the group and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be pushed to the forefront in Netflix’s hotspot
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobar’s killer reveals, the Netflix series is not over yet.
The seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the world’s richest drug-trafficking organization: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful patents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state-owned mortgages and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type who invites American and Colombian criminal prosecutors to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city sets up 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city’s children’s daycare centres.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the city’s children’s day care facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Assistance, this is good news: "We are all very happy".
Cooking continues outside the house: A caterer takes on this task and delivers freshly cooked refrigerated.
The city operates 46 children’s daycare centres in the Krefelder area, with 44 children receiving a warm meal at lunchtime.
Last year, 2,800 children were sitting at the table, and the need is growing steadily.
“In the meantime, not only children who are being cared for for for 45 hours are eating in the kita for lunch,” Pommeranz explains.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care if children stay until 14:00."
46 part-time staff have cooking service from September 1st: they heat the supplied meals, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, spend the food, clean, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the time range.
"The kitchen waitresses are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more strongly involved and it is easier for the cinematography to implement educational concepts."
It is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"Children are supposed to help prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a well-known power in the kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm of improving the quality of kitchen performance, which it has proven to be the most economical in the cost comparison between own government and foreign allocation for the city.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are being re-established.
“But these hours are not so heavy in the education sector for about 750 people,” says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, the UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will run for the provincial council elections. Three women run for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are unrestrictedly involved and involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential election will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincides with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role.

Men try to rob a 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police reports, the men spoke to the 13-year-old who was staying with friends on Kolping Street around 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old, however, refused the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl’s phone and necklace, which failed.
Without arrest, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
Investigations are ongoing.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to make sure that the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie have a long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company has been silent about the future of investments at the tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which among other products produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies.
McVity owner Pladis said he has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be "the first to know" if their activities would change.
In a letter to the company’s head of branch, GMB Scotland McVitie’s called for “concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward.”
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we can’t get clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerned with our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is focusing heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disability.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie."
A Pladis spokeswoman said: “Tollcross’ Head of Branch received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with our employees that we, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and unsafe business environment, are continuously reviewing our businesses – and this applies to all of our business areas and locations – in order to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our customs cross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the legacy of Tollcross as a production site. Should our operations change on site, employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this."
Did PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga page may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not be abandoned in her pursuit of Neymar after she made an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to trigger her release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record strike?
The sensational approach has warmed the transfer window in the summer as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million last season.
After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers salaries of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But the football world was warned three years ago by the PSG president of this outlook?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PSG’s best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to let one of our players sign with them, it will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prize offers to Neymar.
Roller discarded and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw a roller parked in the Königsfelder street in front of property number 30, thereby causing damage to the vehicle’s disguise of over 200 euros.
Schramberg Police, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, requesting guidance.
Police are looking for witnesses for an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because he was hit by a car on his track, the driver of a VW Touran had to escape and touch the control panel.
On Thursday night, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW arrived at the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese.
In the area around Stolzenau, a car hit him on his track, so he had to escape to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guide board.
Sachs damage occurred in the car.
The driver of the vehicle, a Mercedes Benz, had outdated a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the injured driver, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the pollutant vehicle to contact the Office of the Commissioner at Prizenau at Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann said.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, and from the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the pastor.
It would be of great service to the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own failures or their then misappraisal of the proceedings.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticized the fact that the reporting of violence at the domes is being measured with "two measures".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "shaming and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but it is noted that the "degree of media manipulation", according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national biohect.
“The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public to consider it normal,” writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian radio station: "You like to go to church and this is a found meal".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "shocks were a very normal educational means" "to deal with ugly children like I was one".
She found it unfair to apply today’s standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuses, Pope Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Totally wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorial book "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is contained in the 440-page report presented by Ulrich Weber, a lawyer commissioned by the Bishop of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburg domes were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s, with high plausibility, and 67 domes were sexually abused.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, said: "In summary, it can be concluded that, in many cases, physical and mental violence has been applied by Domkapellmeister R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Yet, unlike many other accused, it is noted that many victims valued R.'s general humanity and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on "Occurrences of Violence-Sharing on Protected Persons at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight their “humanity.”
On the other hand, he also appears as a choreographer and perfectionist, who became more often handy when a Domspatz musically did not bring top performance.
How do you, as his biography, appreciate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.
Eight pages have been dedicated to him, and he is clearly freed from any suspicion of accomplice or accomplice in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the preschool also took place outside its sphere of influence.
In any case, one can accuse him of being too late to learn or of not taking his first statements seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium where he worked was felt by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "resolution", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "exquisite", "competent" and "comprehensive", as extremely good-hearted teachers, who were regularly surrounded by children's cakes, cookies and treats.
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which even once led to outbursts of anger.
The fact that he did not only crawl with chairs and threw the keyboard on the floor, but also distributed earrings and drew too bad boys to the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologizes for it.
In order to save him, however, it must be said that such methods of upbringing were widespread at the time in question, during the 1960s and 1970s, both in parents and in teachers.
Do you know any of these breeding methods?
Of course, I think every one of us was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what is actually concerned in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the preschool violence, this is obviously a bagatelle.
There is a question of whether it is rather related to his acquaintance and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many media just fell on him.
The Bavarian pope is still working eagerly for many who have never understood him.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, much has been reported in connection with the report on the topic of abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Definitely no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have relied on the chapel master.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never trusted to talk to my father or mother about it," one of the respondents said, "It was very embarrassing for me."
The real problem with sexual abuse was and still is that most victims remain silent from shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir leader who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger’s role in cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: An interviewed student formulated it as follows: "As to sexual abuse ... I do not see ... a case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have calculated timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I find it ... also really absurd to assume that it counts to him ... Buben has opened more intrusively or more clearly or rather than against their parents, internship leaders, trust teachers, etc.
It's unthinkable to talk to him about sex."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that the students concerned in advance and/or their surroundings were entrusted to him could not be confirmed as part of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any conscience.
Nor can he be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to publicity.
Therefore, there is also no reason to associate his good name with these opposing crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases.
There was a lot of "violence" in the media at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is presented in the report "Watching the Way".
Does he have to live with this charge?
Michael Hesemann: That’s the big problem that everything in the reporting has been mixed and mixed into a huge mess of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is, in turn, an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the high school of homeschooling, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let’s say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspatzen.
All the horrific garbage pedagogy, the cases in which boys were properly bullied and painted by sadistic teachers, and among them suffered horribly, all happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Arrow Courts, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But with them, Dom chapel master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got the boys face-to-face when they were already at the Dom chapel gymnasium.
On it was, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" taboo.
You were just happy to be able to escape and enjoy so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but not sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims valued R.'s general humanity and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him".
At the very least, there is the charge of looking away.
However, despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was informed of the conditions in the preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, he just started establishing himself and from the events at a school where he was just not acting and responsible, (so the Witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Has Georg Ratzinger consistently closed his ears?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he pointed out that "the preschool will continue to be practiced in the preschool".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when plunder penalties were also banned in Bavaria for a long time.
Before that, they took place in a legal gray zone, as each of us probably knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have been overstated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had actually been exceeded.
You can’t say he’d always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the penalties for puberty in schools were officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said yes, it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the “fallkick of anachronism”, that is, the danger of assessing the past according to today’s moral standards.
The princess is right.
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was disgusting at all times, nor does it apply to what was violated in the pre-school by atrocities and violence against innocent children's souls, which is already far beyond what was common at the time.
This is awful and I am glad that it is finally being worked on.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. pulling earplugs and to the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger give in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Is the issue of smuggling also related to the language?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, since the Domspats played only a side role.
However, I am not going to forget that he had a strict regiment there.
But it must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the requirement of absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form from the more nationally known Regensburg Domspatzen to form an institution of world rank (1987 true cultural ambassadors of Europe and 1988 in the USA and its musical tours) (1987 true ambassadors of Europe and 1988 in Japan) and 19 times in the USA in the musical tradition.
With cookies and candy alone, you can never make a great singer out of the boys and stand before every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-sufficiency.
What kind of person did you experience in the conversations with Georg Ratzinger about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and always experience him as a wonderful, humorous, thorough, profound, and heart-felt person, of whom one cannot imagine that he could only do something to a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former domes still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of his family.
Those who do not forgive him until today that he once was strict with them are, therefore, clearly in the minority.
Most of the Domspads today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher—a strict father, of course—but he was also a loving respectable person to whom they still look today and to whom they should worship.
And please, once again very clearly: all that is being said to him are methods of upbringing that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time for a long time.
But it’s extremely unfair to make a man just because he’s prolific and has an even more prolific brother as a media sinner.
The evil intention behind it is just too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now it would be advisable for a 93-year-old man, who has earned great earnings and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen at last.
