Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they "look like fools"
Some of the members of the Assembly have been reduced from the proposal to change their title to "CUP" (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal is provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could be a laughingstock.
One of the laborers said his group was concerned that the new name was "combined with Tup and Vlabb."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, this is definitely offensive.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the whole group was “unhappy” and proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party said that its group was "not preconceived" of the name change, but noted that the new name CWP (in English – MWP) had a certain verbal resemblance to "muffet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the draft law to change the name, made the following statement: “Of course, the final decision for all the descriptive names by which the members of the Assembly are named will belong to the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry into the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to start calling it the “Parliament of Wales”.
As far as the position of its members is concerned, the Commission prefers "Members of the Parliament of Wales, briefly "CPU", but the option "CUP" has received the greatest support after an inquiry into the public.
Members of the House propose alternative options, but reaching a consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elaine Jones, from which he is expected to submit the draft law to the amendment in a few weeks.
The reform bill will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules on disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when they arrive at the debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on whether to change the name of their country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, in which there is an administrative area called “Macedonia”.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum to change the name of the country, has said he will not count the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that changing the name of the country is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent against the backdrop of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I was talking to, there was a bar and a church literally at every corner,” Adams said.
"Today, both of them have disappeared."
Adams shares that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People today are socializing in different ways,” he added.
“The bars are no longer the neighborhoods, where everyone gathers regularly.”
As for the churches, he expressed concern that the money from the sale of the assets would not be enough for as long as the leaders expected, “and sooner or later they will be in the same position.”
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments where people live who don’t help to survive the rest of the neighborhood shrines.
“The vast majority of people who buy homes in these buildings will be white, which will accelerate the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most new settlers will visit them.”
Both churches were built of white pastures before Harlem became the Black Quarter – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist pasture was carried out in the after 1930s.
After that, the building became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
"St. Martin" was a poem by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against the retailers on 125th Street, which served the main shopping street in Harlem, because they did not want to black people to go to the market.
In 1939, the building suffered heavy fire damage, but Father Johnson's nuns made a plan for its restoration, ordering the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them the "poor bells".
The expert who used the bells in July has a different description: “Cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The corresponding expert, Tiffany Nguy, of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first system of bells in the world to be used by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system in the church of Riverside for 18 years.
Mr. Marywooder mentions that it has never been replaced by St. Martin.
What has been played out in St. Martin in the past few weeks has been a complex tale woven by architects and performers, some brought by the secular leaders of the church, and others by the episcopal diocese.
From the newspaper, which is the governing body of the pastorate consisting of world leaders, they wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concern that the diocese “would be inclined to transfer the newspaper’s expenses from the newspaper, even though it did not play a role.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old child injured by shark hunting in California
The shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy last Saturday as he plunged into California on the first day of the hunting season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Biken Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had scuba diving with friends about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and went in with an entire group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought that the child had been caught in a hurricane and was excited, then realized how he was screaming, “He whispered to me!
She hated me!"
Hammel says that when he reached the boy, he found out that the whole area of his key had been broken.
“I called on everyone to get out of the water because there is a shark!” he added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not yet known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
Rescue Captain Larry Jils said in a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the water a few weeks earlier, but was considered not to be of a dangerous nature.
Gilles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of her body.
Responsible authorities have closed access to the coastline from the beach of Ponto in Casablanca to Suomi in Ensitinas for 48 hours for security reasons while the investigation is ongoing.
Jills notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury Plans Offensive on UK Decorative Products Market
Sainsbury is facing Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening decorative products stand at its premises, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK's jewelry market, which is estimated to be <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and home products at the same time are declining, and the largest jewelry stores to date are declining.
The investment turn in the decorative industry is being made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on shelves, previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and other household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the number of decorative products offered to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space, similar to the offers in Boots stores.
The supermarket also re-launches its boutique range of makeup, so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought after by younger users.
In addition, fragrance store Fragrance Shop will test discount programs at two stores in Sainsbury, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the second will be opened in Sely Oak, Birmingham this year.
Online shopping and the shifting focus on buying smaller amounts of food every day at convenient times leads to the fact that supermarkets need to put more effort into attracting buyers.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury, said the facilities will look more and more like universal stores, as the supermarket chain tries to fight off Aldi and Lidl discounts by offering more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury has Argos sites in hundreds of stores, as well as opening Habitats sites since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims has increased sales of foodstuffs and made acquisitions even more secure.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to reshape its facilities for decorative and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint experiment with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in the supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its 281-dollar pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will play a role in the plan, providing a rich range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hiks, Sales Director at Sainsbury, said: “We have transformed the type and character of our decorative stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in special training of our colleagues, who will offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands we offer is designed to meet every taste and everything you need in a captivating environment with a convenient location, making this combination an attractive destination for decorative products that challenges the very concept of the old way to market."
Peter Jones 'sad' after Holly Willby's refusal to sign an 11-million-pound deal
Dragons star Den Peter Jones is “enraged” after television host Holly Willaby resigned from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willaby has no time for the brand household appliances and accessories Truly.
The couple's business is compared to the Goop brand by Guinness Poltrow.
The 37-year-old leader of “This Morning” announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willaby left the Dragons star Den Peter Jones “to boil” after retiring from their revenue-based lifestyle business at the last minute – while focusing on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "snarled" when the "golden girl" on TV acknowledged during Tuesday's tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts were worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The business is similar to Guinness Poltrow's Goop brand, with rumors that it has doubled Wileby's wealth, which is estimated to be worth 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willaby announced on Instagram her departure from True, Jones left the UK by plane to go to one of her vacation properties.
One of the sources shared the following: “Truly was definitely Holly’s highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave weary absolutely all unprepared.
No one believed that this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There’s a warehouse at the Marlowe plant that’s full of products waiting to be sold.”
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leading “This Morning,” which is one of the UK’s most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the huge investment in products that range from the pillows and candles to the clothes and home products.
And last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willabi, who is the mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cape for ten years.
Willaby herself founded True together with Cape in 2016, when Jones, aged 52, joined as the company's chairman in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Bolduin’s television production company.
Willabi will become the M&S brand’s ambassador and will also replace Anne MacParlin as the head of ITV’s “I Am a Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business."
Difficult negotiations that lead to “deterioration of relationships”
He is joking about the criticism he would bear from the news channels for commenting on what someone would consider to be “unsuitable for the president” and too positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in a “journalistic” way.
“I did not give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting was held in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump as "a major step towards the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons."
But negotiations to remove this weapon are stalling.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ree Jung Ho, told the UN General Assembly that North Korea “does not see reciprocal relations” by the United States with its country’s first steps on the path of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the U.S. is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
In his speech, Trump presented a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he said.
“We were headed for a war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we are now enjoying a wonderful relationship.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results – stopping missile tests, releasing hostages, and returning the bodies of U.S. military personnel to their homes.
He also defended his neo-orthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
“It’s extremely easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded area, we’d have about 200 people right there,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroys island and leads to the deaths of hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake of foreign non-governmental organizations, it was stated that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population was forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for initiating international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, there is an unambiguous view that there is no need for international assistance, which makes things a little challenging,” Sumbung said.
While “Save the Children” teams up to head to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
The National Disaster Agency spokesman, Mr. Sutopo, said the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Given the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this type of natural disaster.
Although in Aceh shelters were built in the event of a tsunami, they are not often seen on the other shores.
The apparent lack of a warning cheese about the tsunami in Palu is likely to have contributed to the loss of life, although a warning has been issued.
Even in the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more complicated.
Recently stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, a hospital ship headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days for it to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s remaining infrastructure the center of its election campaign by investing a large amount of funds in roads and railways.
But insufficient finances are constantly harassing his office, while Joko runs the urns again the following year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes, as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other primary weapons.
Look: Daniel Stridge Lately Brings Equality for Liverpool vs Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the High League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Stridge received a pass from Jordan Shakiri about 27-28 metres from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind by 1-0.
He set the ball on his left leg, then fired an accurate shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty field and headed to the upper right corner of the net.
She transferred the floating Kepa Arisabalaga and flew inexorably into the net.
“I tried to take a good position to master the ball because players like Shak are always looking for a lead, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for a good shot at the door,” Stridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante swinging, I pushed my ball, and I just shot without much to think about."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after a goal for Belgian star Eden Azar.
The attacker of the Blues scored a fifth against Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, then sprinted from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
Coiler exchanges fast double serving in the center.
He then released a quick shooting pass, with which he took Azar to a clean position in the criminal field.
Azar ran over the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 this Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea’s next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, according to the country's disaster agency earlier on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the country on Friday and led to waves up to 20 feet high, news conference spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho reported.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, is flooded with ruins from ruined buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was beaten to death
An investigation into a murder has been initiated since this morning in Burkenhead, Mercyside was found a woman's body.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with wounds from John Street's Grayson Mises torture, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking for help from anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I ask everyone who was close to John Street in Burkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
Also, I ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken a picture of something with the cameras on their board, to contact us as it is possible to have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Burkenhead and was found in a private property.
This afternoon a group of friends who consider the woman to be their acquaintance arrived on the spot and asked where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues, with police reporting that they are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver, who lives on Grayson Mies, tried to get home in his apartment, but was notified by the police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
The man remained silent when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told that it would be hours before they were allowed to return home.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
There was a woman who was crying on the spot.
She continues to say, “That’s so terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans crossed the border while another van remained outside.
At the border there are police officers who are monitoring the housing block.
All available information is requested to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, code 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue becomes the latest memorial hit by "rewriting history"
Her ban would be poetic justice for his nearly Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts that was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Society of Cromwell, said: “It was inevitable in this debate to remove statues that Oliver Cromwell’s to Westminster Palace became a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be made a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornicroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider to be worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Crommel is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament against external pressure, and of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person who represents one side of the division that took place.
His achievements as a Lord Protector also deserve to be honored and honored."
Pig killer wounds deadly Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his surname as Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near the liupanshui market hall in the province of Gueijou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig was prepared to inject its pigs with vaccines on May 30, 2005 in Sinin, Qinghai Province, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and he also welded the door to the neighboring hut open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig with a bleed.
Forensic medical expertise has confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked a deadly farmer, the report said.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and disfigured,” Wu said, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera record shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so he could not attack anyone else while the police were collecting evidence of the crime scene.
It has also been reported that Yuan’s family and market leaders are negotiating compensation for the death.
Although they are rare, it has previously been reported of pigs attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, where the man was critically injured after the attack.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig was towed by a Welsh farmer to his tractor, while his wife managed to chase him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “slip.”
“They’re just playing.
Pigs are like little kids, extremely curious... they're not meant to hurt anyone.
But a man must also treat them with respect,” the man concludes.
Weakening Hurricane Rosa will lead to frequent and heavy rains in the southwestern part of the United States
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States.
Rosa includes winds of 85 miles per hour, a Category 1 hurricane at around 5 a.m. on Sunday morning east time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
During this time, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form a synchline, which moves east to the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baha California peninsula on Monday in the form of a rainstorm, it will begin to push the rainbow into the rainbow.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, the tropical moisture along with the approaching synchline will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At the local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, carried debris streams and likely retreats in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to 2 to 3 inches of rainfall per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected, especially over most of Arizona.
There may be flash flooding in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It will be extremely unwise to travel in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to raised dust and windy winds.
The approaching synchline will lead to heavy rainfall in some parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach rains of over half an inch, which will lead to carried small waste streams and sliding roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the rainy season.
Late Sunday and early Monday scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area in late Monday and on Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October may bring major temperature fluctuations to the U.S. while the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday there is a wonderful example of the dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to increase and expand.
In most of the central and eastern U.S. it is expected to have a warm beginning in October, with temperatures from the southern plains to parts of the northeast being expected to prevail around 80 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high likelihood of temperatures above average in the eastern part of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Bret Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the fascinating scene of the testimony of nominees for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault at the age of 80.
During this time, the political opposition continued, with the networks interrupting their regular turnaround programs at the last minute on Friday: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and according to which the FBI must conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Commission that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had pushed her drunk and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his emotion-free testimony, is absolutely categorical that such a thing has never happened.
It’s likely even more than Nielsen’s 20.4 million viewers reported to have watched the testimonial on Friday.
The company has counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no data directly available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen has traditionally struggled to measure the number of people watching from their workplaces.
For comparison, we are talking about an audience similar in size to that of a championship match or the Hollywood Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, is the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen CBS, there were 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After leaving the office of a moderate Republican with a statement that he would vote in support of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras slammed him as protesters whispered on Friday while trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judiciary Commission.
During the entire harassment for a few minutes, he did not raise his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here, standing in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he is telling the truth to the state?
“You have power, while many women are completely helpless,” the attacks continued.
Flake replied that he had already come out of his office with a statement and before closing the elevator doors he announced that he would speak further during the hearing by the commission.
Cable and broadcasting networks provided tight live coverage a few hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate for voting.
Ala Flake said he would only do this if he is sure that the FBI will review the charges against the nominees next week, which Democrats insist on in the opposition.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Party senator Chris Queens.
After talking to Queens and several Senators, Fleck made a decision.
His choice was certainly essential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political jokes" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political plays” with Britain’s future and of undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published on the first page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "Lady's Game Plan" for the Brexit campaign, stating that "the gathering of a large number of tariffs" was a proposal.
Wade Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspect Detian Simpson for Death of LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect for completing a fatal shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dylan Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police reporting that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the site and also found Simpson's DNA on them, the CBS WAFB branch reported.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he had confessed to the fatal shooting against Wade.
His bail was set at <0x24>350,000, Advocate said.
The forensic service in eastern Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday in which the cause of death was identified as a gunshot wound that hit the head and neck.
The administration expresses its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police Refugee Service, the Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and local residents for the assistance provided in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU Athletics Director Joe Aleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for “temporary justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot and 6-inch tall player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
In the last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade reported that the team was "shocked" and "shocked" after Wade's death.
Wade said, “This is something that worries a person all the time.”
Volcano Spreads Ash Over Mexico City
The Popocatepetl ash ejected from the volcano reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after crater activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions have been recorded in the past 24 hours.
The center has observed a number of tremors and thunderstorms.
Photos posted on social media show a thin layer of dust that covers the front windows of cars in some of the neighborhoods of Mexico City, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in volcanic activity, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence collided with the gendarmerie, as thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote to cut off Kato.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to measure peacekeepers with eggs and dust paint, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that are usually crowded by tourists.
Later in the day there were other clashes with the police, and the police resorted to their sticks to take control of the situation.
For hours, independent groups shouted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive,” while those who declared themselves to preserve the country’s integrity turned away with “Spain forever”.
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the desired independence region even a year after the October 1 referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vast majority voted in favor of independence, although activity was low, as most opponents of the detachment boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in the voting sections in the region with a number of stormy clashes.
Independence groups spent Friday night on the streets to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but was forced to go on a different route.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer hopes for Catalonia’s chances of gaining independence.
“Last year was one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now it seems we’re stuck,” he added.
Despite the notable victory of the regional elections in December, the political parties supporting the independence of Catalonia are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most well-known leaders are either in a self-imposed or self-imposed state.
Joan Pyug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was provoked by politicians from both sides.
His comment is that “he’s getting more and more stressed.”
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders arrested in anticipation of a preliminary trial last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and the repressions that we are seeing on the part of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londoners Arrested After Car Crashes In House
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39, respectively, were arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday at around 7:30pm British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said there was damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was shot with a harbor.
Menga's goal brings Livingston's win by 1-0 over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The newcomer in the Livingston High League surprised Rangers and only made Steven Gerard's second loss in his first 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team scored points with the second in the Hibernian ranking.
Gerard's team is left without a foreign field win in the Higher League this season, and next Sunday he is faced with driver Harts, from whom he is eight points behind in the rankings.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a six-match series with no losses in the championship, and manager Holt hasn't felt the taste of the loss yet since he changed to Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses good opportunities against the helpless guests
Holt's team had to lead the result far before he scored a goal, and his direct style of play made Rangers extremely difficult.
Scott Robinson tested the defense, but his blow went away, then Alan Litgou shot past the ridge, after Craig Halket returned the ball with his head to him.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play the ball, knowing that they could seriously hinder the guests from static positions.
And that's how he got to the winning goal.
The Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining each other and bringing out Menga, who took the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty field.
By this time, the Rangers had mastered the ball more, but faced the hosts' impenetrable defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued throughout the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' goalkeeper saved Scott Pittman's leg shot, and Litlow's headshot passed through the door after another static position for Livingston.
In the Livingston Penalty, however, there were centers that were easily cleared, and the judge twice disrespected the guests’ demands for the duspa – first after a fight between Halkett and the Glenn Middleton Reserve, and then in the case of doubts about hand-playing.
“Fenomenal” by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A fantastic game and a great result for Livingston.
The team plays just superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve their performance.
The style of the game and the team almost did not change after the team returned to the Higher League, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Halkett was amazing, organizing the defense in a superb way, while Menga was constantly holding Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell under tension.
At the same time, the Rangers did not show anything inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they showed some great things, but in this case they were much below these standards.
They missed their last pass before the goal, and only once managed to break the hosts’ defense – this loss must awaken the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the rankings.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship cools down due to problems affecting human rights, freedom of the media and Turkey’s acceptance in the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to discover a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters crawled around, wanting to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s own policy and the German government’s decision to allow him to enter the country.
The various protests reflect a fracture caused by a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time is despised as a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist rests after collision with car
A cyclist died after a car collision in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a loaded road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car has stopped and medical assistance has arrived, but the cyclist has died on the spot.
The crash comes months after another cyclist died after being shocked by a runaway driver on Childers Street, located a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
The city police announce that its employees are working on the identification of the man, after which they will notify his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are diverted, and motorists are also advised to avoid the area.
Long Larthin Prison: Six Victims Injured
Six prison guards were wounded in a high-security male prison riot, the Prison Service reported.
The mob exploded at Long Lartin Prison in Warchester at about 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
For the purpose of his rule, special officers from the Tordano unit were called, who would have to deal with eight deprived of their liberty, meddling themselves in a confined to one wing of the prison.
The injured guards suffered minor facial injuries and received medical care on the spot.
A spokesman for the Department of Prisons said: “Specially trained staff are called to deal with the incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six guards received medical assistance.
“We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we make it extremely clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police, and their sentences may be extended.”
Long Lartin prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after the attack on a prisoner, the director of the prison had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, police from the riot-fighting sections were summoned to a prison to master a heavy mob where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens with flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although the drought areas may be useful)
It’s rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical storm, but it’s very likely that this will happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa, a weakening hurricane, travels through the desert in the southwest, carrying with it the risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already established posts against flash floods on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Las Vegas.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Phoenix on Tuesday, as it can bring rain on late Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Swimming Pool, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rainfall possible in individual locations.
For those who are not at risk of flash flooding, the rain caused by Rosa can actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although the floods are extremely serious concerns, part of the rain is likely to be useful as the southwestern part is currently in drought.
According to the U.S. Dry Surveillance Commission, just over 40% of Arizona suffer from at least excessive drought, which is the second-highest category,” weather.com said.
First, the road of Hurricane Rosa leads to landfall near the Baha California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning can still boast a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the drought in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over parts of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of flooding.
“A total rainfall of up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwestern Sonora is expected to be up to 10 inches,” weather.com said.
Rosa will then travel north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona into southern Utah until late Tuesday night.
“The primary risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely strong rain in Baha California, northwestern Sonora and the US desert southwestern,” the National Hurricane Center warned.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash flooding and carrying various waste streams in the deserts, as well as retreats in mountainous terrains.
Attack in Midsummer North: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with torture wounds in Summersett.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Northon around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
He was admitted to a hospital where his condition remained "stable".
During the night, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Summerset said.
Police are asking anyone who might have taken a picture of what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered from the subtlety and anger" of the Democratic Party
“Any vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the Democratic Party’s cowardly and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffered by the subtlety and anger" of the Democratic party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically rejecting Christine Blaise Ford's accusation of sexual assault decades ago at the time when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing of the prosecution.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people today have witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence, courage and qualities.”
“Every vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in the public service,” the president said in a statement.
The president indirectly cited Kavanaugh's nomination, while talking about the importance of Republican votes for the general election.
“There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our time.
Even if I’m not a candidate, I’m actually a candidate,” Trump said.
"That's why I'm walking around and fighting in support of good candidates."
Trump noted that Democrats have set themselves on a mission to “block and block.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, one of the top representatives of the Republican party told CNN.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, death toll rises
At least 384 people lost their lives after many of them were taken by giant waves off the coast when a severe earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when at the celebration the coast was marked by waves up to six metres (18 feet) high, leading many to their deaths and destroying everything along the way.
The tsunami peaked after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the threat of tsunami rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, which has made many of them the victims of the disaster,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the B-Agent.
“The water had pulled cars, trees, whole houses, hit everything along its way,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed the trees and managed to save themselves from the water,” he added.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 centers in Palu.
Posted by the disaster agency, photos from the air showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed and torn bridges, as well as a water-surrounded mosque.
Secondary squirrels continued to lure the coastal city on the Sabbath day.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy released from Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the Hiroshima atomic bomb launched during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and specified that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the ruined buildings, the spokesman added, after which he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be higher on the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the trout.
He also added that “communications are completely intercepted and there is no information from Donggala.”
The Red Cross, for its part, said more than 300,000 people lived there, adding that its teams and volunteers had already headed to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was furiously criticized for not informing about the affected Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves had arrived during the announcement.
Shared on social media, amateur videos show a man on the top floor of the building, who is screaming at people on the street panic warnings about the imminent tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall crashes into the coast and affects both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the clip in a timely manner.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a severe power outage, which halted communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated people still desperately need food and other essential products.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
More than 800 people have died in the Indonesian tsunami.
The situation is extremely bad.
While the employees of World Vision from Donggala managed to safely get to Palu, where they found shelter in brass shelters spread out in the courtyard of their office, they went through a number of scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw countless houses destroyed.”
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the start of work on rescue and recovery operations emergency groups, some complain that foreign rescuers with rich experience in similar situations are prevented from reaching Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, dispatch of personnel and supplies from abroad can only be started if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“The disaster is still at a regional level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government announces that this is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they have not yet declared such a status.”
As it falls on the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the trapped in the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
“As an elder in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel reached the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu racers who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue notes, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Thieves raise <0x24>26,750 while charging ATM in Newport at Levi
On Friday morning, thieves raised <0x24>26,750 from a Brink employee who had loaded an ATM in Newport, Levy, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to load it with money, Detective Denis Macarthy wrote in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “approached running behind the back of Brink’s employee” and stole a purse of money.
Witnesses have seen many suspects fleeing the scene, the statement continues, but the police did not indicate the number of people involved in the theft.
Anyone who has information about the suspect's identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper Changes His Name to Jee
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Jee.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: "The man officially known as Kanye West."
West, aged 41, has been wearing the nickname Jee for some time and has been using it as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the show, which declined “for emotional reasons,” the show’s creator told us.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'he' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you' or 'you'," West shared earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“That’s me, that’s me, that’s us.
He passed from Kanye, which means only one person, just to Him – which is a reflection of the good in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is a reflection of our essence.”
The rapper is one of many famous in his sphere who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and nicknames, including Puf Dadi, P Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preferences to the pseudonyms Lion and Brother Lion.
One of West's former co-workers, J. Z., also presented himself in a variant with or without a ribbon and/or capital letters in his nickname.
Mexico's president vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has sworn he will never use military force as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repressions against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, President Lopez Obrador promised "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with leftist political views gradually spread to Latin America.
López Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and discovering more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attracted young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. needs to double funding for AI development
At a time when China is increasingly active on the AI development front, the U.S. needs to double its research budget in this area, says AI researcher and developer Kai Fu Loy, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various U.S. government departments made statements on the topic of AI, although the U.S. in general does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: the country aims to become the number one innovation in AI by 2030.
“The doubling of the budget for developing AI will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the United States and are about to make further breakthroughs with regard to AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could also double the chances of the next major AI achievement coming from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “The Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest companies for AI – Fa<0x2B> in China.
In the 1980s at Carnegie University, Mellan Lee worked on an AI system that beat the most successful hotel player in America, after which he was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee lends due to previous technology competitions to the federal government, such as the Agency’s Robotics Competition for Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asks when the next one will be, which will help identify new visionaries.
“Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to earn government funding,” Lee said.
"It's not China taking away academic leaders, it's taking away corporations," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring university lights to work on AI.
Lee further argues that changes in immigration policy can help the United States strengthen its AI program.
“I think that the doctors of AI sciences should automatically be offered green cards,” the man said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding for people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other state organizations fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from the industry and academic environments, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month DARPA announced an investment of <0x24>2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, they are currently investing more than <0x24>100 million a year in the development of AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not noted any activity in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked Macedonia's membership of the European Union and the EU.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents claims against its territorial integrity, which is why it requires a veto of its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority.
President Georgie Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum until at the same time his boycott campaign casts a shadow of doubt on whether the referendum will be able to reach the minimum 50 percent required to recognize the validity of the vote.
The question of the newsletters is as follows: “Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that its price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the formation after the disintegration of the Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to give my voice for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum does not have binding power, enough members of Parliament have decided that they will take account of the result to such an extent that the vote already has a decisive weight.
To change the name of the country, two-thirds of parliamentarians must vote for it.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, electoral activity was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters visited the polls.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Giose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will open the way for NATO and the European Union to join, in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje at age 54, Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small stage and arranged chairs in front of the tents, strained by the boycotting referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the gate for servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as the country’s unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as over 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He also said that the positive result would lead to “affirmation of the future of our people.”
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published results of a survey that said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another survey, the case of Macedonian television Telma, reported that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of the respondents said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum was unsuccessful, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it won power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes through Brighton's entire defense and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overtook Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Steady in Manchester, England.
Aguero’s goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalkeeper was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran three defenders from Brighton before sprinting with the ball in the empty space forward.
After that, Aguero was surrounded by four players in green.
He slipped past one of the defenders, then left behind the rest on the border of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he turned left to Sterling.
The English striker with one touch returned the ball to Aguero, who with a right-legged kick over Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
"Aguero is struggling with some injuries to his legs," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We planned to play for about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal right now.”
But Sterling was the one who provided the initial advance of the "infernal" in this game of the Higher League of England.
He broke up in the 29th minute.
In the situation for the naked Aguero got a pitch deep in Brighton's half.
He immediately released a leading pass on the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sane advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the far beam.
The assailant of the "inconsistent" managed to spot close, just before the ball went out.
City will face Hofenheim in a group stage match of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at the Rain Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play determine the fate of the Rockies
Since the Nationals did not qualify for the playoffs, there is no particular meaning for another game of the title-starting pitcher.
Still, the always ambitious Shercer hopes to be the title holder on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies if the game is significant for the Rockies, who lead one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West rankings.
The Rockies guaranteed their participation in at least a wild card game after a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still uncertain whether they will win their first title in the division.
"While we're not fighting for anything, we want to finish the season with a nice game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important game for them this year.
Why would I want to miss such a game?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but are expected to allow Scherzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Scherzer, this would be the 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, as he coached on Thursday and would have the normal rest time until Sunday.
The Washington right-handed pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Recruits Supporters in West Virginia
President Koso pointed to the situation with his electorate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
“In November, everything we have achieved will be put at risk.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections in our lives.
“This is one of the biggest moments in current history – I also say that even if I’m not a candidate, I actually participate, that’s why I’m fighting with all my strength for the right candidates,” Trump said.
“You all see this horrific, terrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain their power in any way, you yourselves are witnesses to their imperdoability, to evil.
They don’t care when they can hurt, who they have to beat to get into power and government, because they’re only interested in power and government, but we’re not going to give them to them.”
The Democrats, according to the president, set themselves the goal of “to hinder and hinder.”
“What we’ve all seen in the last four days,” he continued, calling the Democrats “rageous, ugly, deceptive and unfaithful.”
The president recalled the Senate Judicial Commission, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Finnstein namely, which sparked a strong outcry from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
Please, what?
No, no, I was waiting — it was really a dirty gesture — perhaps the worst I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer widespread.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I’m just the last member of the Labour parliament to date, who was said not to be welcome – just because I’m speaking frankly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, has received a similar attitude as she has decisively opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, issues that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy expressed disagreement in the times of the previous leaders.
In a statement at the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated that “we want the meetings to include everyone and be beneficial.”
For most of my eight years as a local representative of the laborers in Parliament, Friday meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and the promises of “lighter and more moderate” politics have long been forgotten, if ever at all, on the agenda.
It became increasingly evident that the different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion was judged on the basis of how much the leadership of the party liked it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I worked for, I thought, shared similar political views, began to expect me to make a reverse turn and take positions that I would never agree with — whether it be national unity or national unity.
Whenever I make public speeches – no matter what I actually say – there is a whole insulting tyranny on social media where it is called for a revocation, a rejection of moderate politics, a statement that I do not belong to the Labour Party.
This doesn't just happen to me.
In the interest of the truth, I know that I have even drawn more luck from some of my colleagues, since the comments for me are at least of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purposefulness of these colleagues who face sexist or racist substitutes every day without being afraid of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that laborers should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer widespread, with every sign of distrust or change in the rules of choice becoming increasingly narrow.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice to be humble, not to say so much, and that then “everything will be fine.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the laborers 32 years ago as a student provoked by the government of Thatcher, which through his neglect led to the literal disintegration of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services as a caretaker or caretaker for those who most need them.
I have never concealed my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political stance and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all of those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state strives for Brexit, it will hurt households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader.
But in reality, my message is not to the Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of revocation or political dismissal will refuse me to act in the way I think best.

Air 38-17 Melrose: The Invincible Air lead in the rankings
The two late rehearsals may have changed the final score slightly, but there is no doubt that Aire deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent High League match.
The team has already headed the rankings and only one of the ten teams is without loss so far.
Better defense and better use of opportunities have been decisive in the match, which coach Peter Murchi and his team can be very pleased with.
"I'm happy because the other teams have tested us quite seriously in the past matches and we're still without losses," Murchi said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to Air, they really took advantage of their positions better than us.”
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional hit on Frasier Clima, led Aire to the result, but a yellow card for Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play the game as Dzedars were tracked by Warriors, allowed Bassard to score.
Clima increased the lead for Air from a penalty kick just before the half-life, marking an essay after a solo action, and then realizing the additional kick, making the score 17-5 for Air on the rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional strike on Bagot, reduced the lead to just five points.
It followed a prolonged cessation of the game due to a severe injury to Ruard Nott, who was carried on a carrier, and after the renewal of the match Air increased their advance after an essay by Stafford McDowell and a successful additional blow to Clima.
Aer Blair McFerson's current captain was then given a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage, under strong pressure, and realised an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
However, the hosts regained the presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after defeating Clima without a ball, McFerson made an ass with the help of Air's advanced offensive line.
Clima realised the additional blow, rather than long after doing it again, after Kyle Row caught the kicked ball from David Armstrong and took the wing of Gregor Henry on the flank for the hostess' fifth ass.
The star of Still Game appears to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to have headed towards a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered that he was appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, which he is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the finale for the show, as it seems that Kiranan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan had planned to join Glasgow's "blooming restaurant business".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia’s lack of sea exit hopes the ship will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The Marines are constantly patrolling naval detachments in La Paz.
Over the public buildings is a blue flag of the ocean.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: “The sea belongs to us rightfully.
It is our duty to bring it back.”
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit handed over to Chile after a bloody 19th century conflict is still alive – as well as the call to float again from the Pacific Ocean.
In fact, this hope is now the strongest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a verdict from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of reflection.
“The force is in Bolivia, wisdom and unity are felt everywhere, and the country expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadila.
Many Bolivians will watch the judgment of the international court on the big screen across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will support Bolivia's request and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is about to go to a contested re-election battle next year, has also put a lot and a lot on the judgment of the court on Monday.
“We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean,” Moralez said last August.
But some analysts believe that the probability of the court taking a decision in favor of Bolivia is quite low, and even if it judges in its favor, it would not change things in reality.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to take over Chile and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgement of the International Court of Justice is only six months after the last arguments have been heard indicates that the case is “not complicated,” says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of contributing to the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
“The problem with access to the ocean was blown up by the current Bolivian government,” Zarate said.
He then suggested that Morales's military rhetoric had disappeared and Chile's little goodwill remained.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after a normal dialogue.
The two sides have not supported diplomatic missions in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltse, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday Bolivia will have “an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile” as well as a chance to “end 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both sides.”
Calzadilla also rejected the idea that Morales, who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, has used the problem of access to the ocean as a “political pathetic.”
"Bolivia will never give up its right to exit the Pacific," he added.
“Judging is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems.”
North Korea says it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ree Young Ho, said his country would never step up nuclear disarmament first if it was not able to trust Washington.
Ree delivered his speech on Saturday to the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises they made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of re-launching nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un.
Ree called the idea an "empty hope" that continuing with US sanctions and objections to a declaration that would put an end to the Korean War would make the North fall on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture in the way of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Pyongyang they are serious about renouncing an arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion reviews in Paris reveal the latest list of massive hats that will soon be in the fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun’s rays, you don’t need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection that smashed the fashion podium during Paris Fashion Week.
Pretty impractical hats sparked a wave on Instagram during the summer, as designers sent eye-catching creations to crush the fashion community.
Valentino’s offering was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide periphery that literally absorbed the heads of the models.
Other too big accessories included jewelry dinosaurs, magic hat and even pineapple – but they’re not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and reminisced not so much of the upper fashion as of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled a full-fledged diving gear with snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a melted funky ice cream.
If you’re in a similar fashion trend, you’re lucky.
Fashion specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come soon after “La Bomba” – the straw hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on everyone’s heads – from Riana to Emily Rataikovsky.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat that took over the social networks led to the emergence of another huge design on the fashion podium – a muddy beach bag, almost as big as the wearer wearing it in a bathing pattern.
The raffia-colored orange bag, with raffia ribbons and a white leather handle, was the eye-catching item in Jacquemus’s La Riviera SS19 collection during Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitid told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the fashion stores next summer – after the designer made such a big impression, it will be hard to ignore the demand for jewelry stores.”
John Edwards: Language Skills are Essential to Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic distinction, continuing in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the exam results, which is only enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, arts, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen career, and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can create and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language that you understand, your words can reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year’s exams, we see that languages are in the first place with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved a high grade A.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS school members, showed that 72% of the students achieved A grade in Chinese, with 72% of German students, 69% of French schools and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need for the future.
Currently, languages as subjects of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in and beyond the programs of independent schools.
A 2014 study conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of employers found it difficult to find jobs because of inadequate linguistic skills.
Therefore, the mastery of foreign languages is becoming more and more compulsory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more job positions require the mastery of a foreign language, which makes these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masteres a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having mastered such a skill, which remains for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person’s mastery of one’s breasts in front of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult UK citizens in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak a language, as French was the only language to reach a two-digit 1%.
That’s why investing in language learning is important for children today.
The mastery of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be different from the languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the UK in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, and the teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, regardless of what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role for the future of which country has to take this into account in the education system.
And indeed, modern languages must really be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for Lakers this week in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the fans who are eager to see LeBron James' first match with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will take part in the team's first game of pre-season training against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is not yet clear how many minutes he will play in the match.
“He’ll be on the field in one to 48 minutes,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel announced on Twitter that James is likely to play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of Lakers' pre-season training.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the new season,” he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of pre-election rally tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned rallies, which include stops at well-known locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing the affirmative vote on his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened by losing control of Congress in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's visit to Wiling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00, Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s visit to Weeling, West Virginia, below by streaming live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider this week's hearings for nominations to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in which tensions have emerged over allegations of immoral sexual acts, which holds the Senate's affirmative vote for up to a week as the country runs an investigation.
The main goal of this series of rallies, however, is to help Republicans gain inertia for the November elections.
President Donald Trump’s campaign said the five rallyes next week were aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so essential to his program that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are launching a campaign season filled with commitments,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The rally tonight, scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Weeling, could bring backers from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s second visit this month will be held on Saturday in West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in sociological studies.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisy that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
"Rider Cup" 2018: The U.S. team will fight to the last, keeping their hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without an intriguing "forum", the Sunday afternoon matches may have brought what the "Rider Bath" needed.
Changing the advantage in the sport is a rather subjective concept, however, in which players believe unreservedly, even more in competitions like this one.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
“They drove six points, and now they’re just four, so I guess we’ve gotten a little bit of inertia,” said Jordan Spite at the end of today’s race day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage with only twelve more to allocate.
However, as Spite says, Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge by the sports form of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Spite shows great shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the real leader of his team.
Fans' inspiring announcements were getting stronger as he advanced in the round, in which he scored with a precise kick in the fourth match, after he and Thomas were left behind by two strikes after the first two holes.
His strike, which won the game at the 15th hole, was greeted with strong enthusiastic reactions that make us believe that not everything is really lost to the American team.
“The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own game,” Spit says.
That's all that's left for these players right now.
Eighteen holes to remember.
The only players with more points than Spite and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed heroes of the "Rider Bath" so far.
The strange but wonderful couple from Europe, won four out of four and they seem to get it all.
“Molywood” were the only couple that did not make “gods” on Sunday afternoon, but they also did not have “goddies” either on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon or morning.
These successes, as well as the way the energy seemed to pass between them and the enthusiastic fans, confirmed the view that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than the "Flywood and Molinari" team, which will bring the "Potential Golf" to the National.
Preferably both in different holes at the same time.
The stories of European fame, however, turned out to be a little premature.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson quickly coped with Sergio Garcia, the hero of "foreball" matches from the morning while he was partnering with Alex Noren.
The "Gods" and the two "squats" of the first nine holes brought the Spaniards and the Swedes into trouble they couldn't cope with.
On Sundays, however, no one else can solve your problems.
"Fourball" and "Foursum" matches are extremely interesting for close viewing due to the interactions between the pairs, the tips they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can undergo change at any given moment.
The Europeans played better on the team and therefore accumulated a significant lead before the last day, but this forum session showed that the American team is also ready to fight until the last – something that many people, especially in the US, were strongly in doubt.
Europe led by 10–6 on the last day of the Rider bath.
Europe will have a solid lead ahead of the last day of the Ryder Cup after leading the United States by 10–6 after playing the matches of the "foreball" and "forecast" formats on Saturday.
The inspiring duo Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari began with two wins against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, with which their asset in the Le Golf National race increased by four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy that he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated in the morning's "foreball" matches over Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and ultimately Europe won the series with a 3–1 draw.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the "forum" matches, where they won two wins, but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furick's team needs 8 points out of 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flywood is the first newcomer in Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known as Mollywood, became only the second pair after this sensational weekend, winning four points from their first four matches.
After impeaching Woods and Patrick Reed in the foreball matches, they were extremely motivated to beat the broken Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambu with an even more categorical score of 5&4.
Woods, who barely went through his two games on Saturday, only occasionally showed flare-ups of his genius, but so far has 19 losses out of 29 matches in "foreball" and "forecourse" matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who had a break for the morning furball matches, partnered with Henryk Stanson in the foreground clashes at the 2&1 victory over Justin Johnson and Brooks Copka, respectively number one and number three in the world.
The team of Europe, however, failed to enjoy a pleasant, cool and cloudless day in the southwest of Paris.
The three-time winners Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas took back the hopes of the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They scored a difficult 2–1 win against the Spaniards John Ram and Jan Polter in the foreball matches, and later returned to beat Polter and Rory MacKilroy with 4&3 in the foreball matches, though they lost two.
Only twice in the history of Rider Cup has a team made a four-point deficit before the singles, and according to the rules, Furick's team will hold the trophy even at equality.
However, since they were overturned in two consecutive days, their chances of turning on Sunday are not particularly high.
North Korea says there is "no way" to disarm unilaterally, without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are deepening distrust of the United States and there is no way the country can unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the World Organization’s annual general meeting, Ree Young-hoo said that “significant goodwill measures have been taken over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear testing facility and promising not to deploy it.
“However, we don’t see any appropriate reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under no circumstances can we disarm ourselves unilaterally first.”
While Ree expressed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stupid" approach to nuclear weapons removal, in which North Korea will be rewarded for taking one step-by-step measures, Pyongyang said.
Ree cited a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S.-North Korean presidential summit in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to work for the “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula,” and sent him to Trump.
North Korea is striving for an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the U.S. says that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for alleviation of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists ‘to remove nuclear weapons first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even opposes ‘the declaration of the end of the war’,” he said.
“The realization that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a meaningless dream for those who don’t know us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ree did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the U.S. leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea, not the United States, the elimination of nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula.
However, the tone of Ree’s speech was significantly different from the previous year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles to the mainland of the United States was inevitable after Trump called the “bad president” Kim “the man himself.”
Last year at the UN, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “complete destruction” last year, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions must remain in place until North Korea removes the sanctions.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time to do so and said, “It doesn’t matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must necessarily continue until it is fully, definitively and definitively implemented.”
The Security Council unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to halt the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ree at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Beijing again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had made progress, but only a few hours later North Korea accused him of making “gangster requests”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he is striving for are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard on a course for a sufficient break
A new course at Harvard University this year leads all students to sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing culture of learning “all night” with the help of caffeine.
The teacher found that students at the number one university in the world often don’t even think about when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and the Women's Hospital, prepared a course he thinks is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“Finally, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are they telling me this until now, in my last year?’
“She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the most important thing about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements, as well as to improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the University’s executive director of health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in the bedroom, in which students click on cups of coffee, curtains, tiles and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are influenced by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term deprivation of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this does not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,” added Prof. Kaysler.
The culture of pride from “learning all night” still exists, he says, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Providing adequate and quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid filling up, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger mode that causes them to constantly starve.
Raymond Soo, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaysler prepare the course by taking one of his classes in his first year in Harvard.
He says his course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it all over the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduate students to be asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaysler advises students to think about setting a sleep and wake alarm and to know the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and the LED lighting that can disrupt the circadian rhythm to and from the problem.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Menga's goal crushes Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Stephen Gerard's helpless team and brought a 1–0 win for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as a triumphal guest in February with a 4–1 over St. John's, but Gary Holt's team only brought Gerard's second defeat in his 18-match defeat as a manager in the Habroks, which left his team eight points behind.
Menga noted seven minutes before the break, and the deprived of constructive ideas the Rangers team at no point seemed close to equalizing.
After the match, the Rangers took sixth place, and Livingston are already third, leaving behind the second Hibernian only in the goal difference.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems as side judge Calm Spence got a head injury after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown away by the fans of the guests.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that defeated Air in the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same Livingston single-player who scored a point against Harts last week, and should be satisfied with the way his aggressive team pampered all of the opponent's actions.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston did better in the rarer cases when they owned it.
They were supposed to score in the second minute when Menga brought out Scott Pittman with a touch against goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
Later centering on Keegan Jacobs from Fowl found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgou turned the ball away from the rear ridge.
The Rangers took control of the game, but failed to create anything content in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be a bump in the 15th minute when he faced Steven Lowell, but referee Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian claim.
The Rangers scored only two precise strikes in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly managed easily to hit Lasana Kulibaly's head with a weak shot of Oviedo.
Although Livy’s 34th minute hit was surprising given the possession of the ball, it was fully deserving.
The Rangers again failed to cope with deep concentration of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly handed it to Menga, for whom it was easy to realise.
Gerard reacted to the break by changing Kulibaly with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately resulted when the wing handed over to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the strike.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play in a comfortable game-style for the hosts, as Litgou and Halket continuously kicked the forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor managed to cope with Jacobs' strike, and with the subsequent Corner Litgou shot with a head by the beam.
Glenn Middleton from Rangers, who entered as a reserve, asked for a duel at the end of the duel after a fight with Jacobs, but Thompson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Heavy Duty Counter
Page from our annual Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROEN... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
He develops a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately leads to the creation of a device known as a gauge counter.
A cornerstone in science since then, the gauge counter has also become the cornerstone of pop culture, when in 1950 the film "The Campanas of Coronado" was released, in which the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans took part.
Man: “What, for God’s sake, is this?”
Rogers: This is a gauge counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: “Surely he shoots right now!”
Hans Haiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Train the Immune System to “See” Foreign Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Train the Immune System to “See” Foreign Cells and Kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and are injected back into the patient.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw how her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein, common to many cancers called HER2, and then injected again into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “training” them on how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump wearing a hat with the inscription “Let’s make America great again” while participating in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was cast in the studio during Saturday Night Live after he made a pointless performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the night called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription “Let’s Make America Great Again,” he pleaded against the Democrats and expressed his support for Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which the Hollywood star sneered at Brett Kavana's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Commission for Sexual Violence Complaints made by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's performance recording was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to play West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
“I was thrown behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go out with this hat."
I've been interrupted!
And then they say I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West goes on, "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming that he will wear Superman's costume, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try it with love.”
The comments provoked at least twice the crowd’s screams and members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one of them saying, “The whole studio is shut.”
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confuses many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle "Perie".
West received the support of the leader of the TPUSA Conservative group, Candes Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest: BLAGADOR YOU ARE THE ONE WHO WAS AT THE METHOD OF THE TRADE.”
However, the show’s lead, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just “self and that’s wonderful.”
“But I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) whom I think he welcomes and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
“That’s what we are,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now "known officially as Kenny West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows the example of Didi, also known as Puffy, Puffy and Puffy.
His friend, rapper Snup Dog, was called Snup Lion, and the musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Accused of attempted murder after knife-cutting at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecutor's office.
Star of Game of Thrones Keith Harrington is against toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as John Snow in the violent medieval fantasy NGO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has voiced his opposition to the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen often leads young people to think that they need to be “cruel” in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed “something was wrong” and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admits she feels "strongly convinced" that this problem needs to be solved.
“At the moment, I’m personally firmly convinced – what have we confused about masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach teenage men about the problem we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the many masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is being taught?
What is taught on television and on the street, which makes boys feel that they have to become this particular type of men?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how to change it?
'Cause there's obviously something confusing about young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not take part in prehistory or sequels to "Game of Thrones" after the series ended next summer, claiming that he had "ending with the battlefields and the horses."
Since November, Keith will play in Sam Shepard's "True West", a story about the filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said dating his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so that’s how he gave me my future family and set my life forward,” he said.
Rose plays Game of Thrones, the girl in which Kit John Snow's hero falls in love, in a fantasy series, the winner of the Amy Award.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China reported a jump of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to the health services in the country, more than 820,000 people have been affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases have been reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change in comparison to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China’s health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, each year, the number of people living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGBT communities is widespread.
According to the studies, 70-90% of men who had sexual intercourse with men because of their conservative values eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of diseases are the result of improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data leaks from Republican senators, denouncing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned the allegations that a member of her team had published personal information to three state senators from Republicans on the pages of legislators on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and websites of the “ultra right wing”.
“Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes the home addresses and telephone numbers of Utah-based Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing of the Senate committee on charges of immoral sexual behavior against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made possible after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was linked to the Waters office, and released information about its team member, Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and is an absolute lie,” said Waters.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and is an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement promptly sparked criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Flescher.
“There is poison in this denial,” Flitter wrote.
“This suggests that she does not have the temperament suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
I don't have to question the prosecutor's motives.
It must be calm and balanced.”
Flyer compared Waters' reaction to critics from the democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics that he also appeared angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“Essentially, if it is true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had prosecuted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraudulent claims.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators will be disclosed, and that they will be held legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team.”
Review of "Johnny English explodes again" – the weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new film with British involvement, and it seems that this also applies to the revival of the action-comedy, spy franchise for Johnny Inglesh – which was launched in 2003 with "Johnny Inglesh" and "Johnny Inglesh".
Will self-smiling and mimics, which say how obvious we are, become a new opportunity for the nation to export?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with eye-opening and “human” face is allowed to renew things a second time – his name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a great comic creation intended for movie fans who don’t speak English.
He, of course, is a stupid secret agent, who despite his strange claims for graceful glow owns a little of Cluzo, a little of Mr. Bean and a large part of the man who contributed with a note on the musical theme of the 2012 London Chariots of Fire.
In addition, it was originally based on the chaos that left behind a traveler and an international man whom Atkinson played in Barclaycard’s already forgotten television ads.
In the last film with Johnny English, there are two good moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and for a short time the feathers were stuck in his helmet.
Atkinson’s contribution to the physical comedy is obvious, but humor is rather weak and strangely redundant, especially when “serious” movie brands like “007” and “Mission Impossible” include a dose of comedy.
The humor appears to be directed at children rather than adults, and I don’t think Johnny English’s ridiculous accidents are innovative and focused, as Actinson’s play doesn’t resemble Mr. Bean.
The current assumption is that the UK is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker has hacked the UK’s super secret spy network and revealed the identity of all the agent’s horror operatives – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the premiere, who has been inflated and familiar with the figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this Quasi-Theresa-May role, but the script has nothing to do with it.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that she must call a retired agent, as all the agents in operation are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is currently working as a teacher at a chic center, but is illegally teaching lessons on how to be a covert agent: here are some good hits when English re-creates a spy rock academy.
English is summoned to Whitehall for emergency instruction and meets again with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, a fun role in which Vicky Pepperdin's talent is a little wasted.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret services and confront the deadly beautiful Ophelia Boulettova played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the vicious Jason Volta played by Jack Lacey.
Inglesh and Bo start their odyssey of farce: disguised as waiters, burning up a French restaurant; creating chaos when they sail on Volta's luxury yacht; and Inglesh stirs up real anarchy when he tries to use a helmet for a virtuoso.
All the jokes are certainly taken from the previous film, but since so cute and luxurious, there is a lot more content intended for children here.
Pretty medium-sized production.
As with the other Johnny English movies, I keep thinking: can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labourers deny that they are developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but get paid for five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that requires the British to work four a week but get paid for five.
The party claims it wants the heads of companies to provide the economies made through revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them another day of rest.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would “save” the economic program and the party’s plans to shake the country in favor of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected to be reported for a policy review by the end of the year.
“It won’t happen right away, but the four-day working week is an endeavor that fits the rebalancing approach to the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s general industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this striving does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not in the party’s policy, it is not considered.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonald used last week’s Labour Conference to unveil his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to take power back from “impersonal directors” and “speculators” in utility companies.
The Chancellor’s shadow plans also mean that current owners of shares in the water supply companies may not receive their full share, as the Labour government could impose “strippings” on the basis of the established violations.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on boards of companies and set up privatization funds to transfer 10 percent of the net capital of private companies to employees who can accumulate annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy talk before 60 minutes if the FBI’s investigation on Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least one week and raised the question of whether the findings of the Bureau could make some of the senators deputy.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy looked more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after that statement came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, categorical and ambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
“I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and to change that, a shocking charge is needed,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denies it categorically," Graham said, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one she mentioned, but she could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the “Global Citizen” festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive band of performers and performs an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people at the Great Meadow in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also get acquainted with the true purpose of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international protection group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” such as voluntary participation, not sending an email to a world leader, calling a target call or otherwise contacting to help.
But how successful is a “Global Citizen” for 12 years before achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” – people think they’re doing something meaningful when signing an online petition or posting a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who insist on a number of different goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies of more than <0x24>37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and communications resulting from its actions, with at least <0x24>10 billion already being paid or collected.
The group believes that the funds already have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include Twitter’s “Food Force”, established in the UK partnership between investors and performers, a commitment to “supporting children to develop their full potential,” which promises to give Rwanda more citizens than <0x24>35 million, and more than the promise to give Rwanda more than <0x24>4 million.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into just a historical note,” Ambassador Tracy Ulman told the audience at a concert.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were undertaken to call on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has reported funding for a project, “The Power of Nutrition,” which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the CDCs on its website, asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
“Global Citizen” replied: This will be a long and difficult journey – sometimes we will fail and again we will fail.
But as with the big civil rights movement and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janel Mona are just some of the performers of this year’s New York event, led by Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use naval forces to “block” and prevent energy exports – Interior Minister
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zink said, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zink argues that Russia’s involvement in Syria – specifically where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market,” he said.
Zinc addressed the attendees of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
“The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulating and replacing fuel,” he said, while defining Russia as a “one-number weight”, with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with boosting liquid gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump’s administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” pipeline project “North Stream 2”, which Trump says turns “Berlin” into Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fiery opposition to the project was dictated simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Pervak Mo.
The U.S. position sparked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take the 2020 presidential nomination seriously, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would “seriously look” at the presidential nomination after the midterm elections.
During a city council in Holioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
“It’s time for women in Washington to come in and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she told The Hill.
“On November 6th, I will take the presidential nomination seriously.”
Warren expressed his judgment on President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he "leads this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m in the depths of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy,” she said.
Warren was frank in her criticisms of Trump and his High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A sociological survey conducted on Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren’s voters themselves don’t think it should be nominated in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a study by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this proposal.
The sociological study showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour and 48 percent against.
Other senior representatives of the Democratic Party, discussed in terms of potential candidacy in 2020, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would take an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed to Trak Palin's PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recording in September.
He was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through when he returns is familiar to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are recovering from,” she told an audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an “elephant in the room” and told his son and other war veterans that “they are coming back a little bit altered, scorned, back and wondering if they will get the respect that they and their arms brothers have given to the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Basila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, was included in a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of emergency, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Basila police department.
18 states and counties of Colombia support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial dispute over a new U.S. policy that denies asylum for victims of gang violence and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and counties filed a petition for goodwill in Washington in support of asylum seekers and contesting policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, has not been disclosed.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of the cruel members of his gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected the asylum application on July 20.
She's under arrest in Texas.
U.S. lawyers helping Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, of which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as nations facing comprehensive gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy returned the 2014 Immigrant Board of Appeal decision, allowing immigrant documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia County Attorney Carl Rasin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignored decades of state, federal and international law."
“The federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered according to the specific facts and circumstances and such a ban violates this principle,” the report said.
In addition, the lawyers claim in the report that the policy that refuses to enter immigrants is damaging to the U.S. economy, stressing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing asylum to victims fleeing domestic harassment and gang violence.
“Asylum is given to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in his July 11 statement on politics.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems – not all serious ones – that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths double during search for survivors <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The situation for the survivors is getting more and more difficult.
“I feel very tense,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, reassuring her sick boy in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance carries more bodies.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents have been noticed returning to their destroyed homes to try to save some of their flooded things.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, has been housed outside Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are being treated outdoors due to continuing secondary cramps.
His eyes were filled with tears when he recalled how he felt the terrible earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was pushed into the broken wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with his family to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, but then I shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Harassment' with 'Propaganda Advertising'
A week after an official newspaper in China released a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily about the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the paid publication of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa — after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections.
Trump’s accusation that Pequi was trying to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections noted what U.S. officials told Reuters it was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to launch commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war in which they offset tariffs on imports between countries.
According to experts from the US and China at the beginning of the trade war, China's tariffs were intended to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a commentary in the Des Moines Register Sunday issue, “is currently doubling this harassment by launching propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America’s respected tradition of freedom of speech and the press by launching paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” he wrote.
“In contrast, at the newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you’ll find limited speeches and you won’t see a true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people may have about the alarming kishun,” he said.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish” his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With Kavanaugh’s pogrom, Republicans reject women’s voters for midterm elections, analysts warn
As many of the high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend nominees for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh on several charges of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a response, particularly from women, during the pre-trial period.
The emotions around the table are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue with the vote.
These things cannot be returned," Grant Rahr, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Rahr said he doubts whether the last-minute urging of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate by the FBI will be enough to soothe angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it neither tomorrow nor in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” during a demonstration in the Senate corridor as Republicans controlling the Judicial Commission decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination in spite of the testimony of Mr. Bryant.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded,” Stew Rottenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news.
“People say the problem is serious; it’s true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among voters in the suburbs and younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's nominations, analysts suggest that a response could be followed if Republicans insist on affirming the nomination.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the table, it’s about how Republicans deal with it and how they treat it,” Gay Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told a news channel.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat divided on the question of who to believe as a result of Ford and Kavanaugh’s statements, and a little more clinging to the latter.
A new sociological survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s statements, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they said Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied during his statements, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Commission that Kavanaugh had attacked her in a state of emergency when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her genitals in front of her while she was at a party during her follow-up in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a venture that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds the open source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that the intention behind Inrupt is “world domination”.
“We have to do it now,” he said about the effort.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “online personal data storage” or POD.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available across every browser, and at the same time is all of them simultaneously.
The unique thing about the online storage of personal data is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it “the empowerment of personal data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several developers who have signed a contract to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change or not, when all their business models are completely renewed overnight.
“We don’t want permission from them.”
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide energy for trade and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a strong influence in the net neutrality debate.
Despite launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: In memory of the priest awarded with the Victoria Cross during the First World War
It marks the 100th anniversary of the birthplace of the only Anglican priest, awarded with the Victorian Cross for his involvement in combat during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing that he had been awarded the highest military honours in Britain.
A memorial monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s medal-winning work.
According to the London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from artillery and artillery."
He later attacked the fire line and with "incredible courage" led the building forward before attacking an artillery rifle with one hand and killing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do, but it makes me be humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was a “great honor to be part of the parade” and added that “the virtue of the real hero is demonstrated by the support that will be provided to many people.”
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine that you’ve been waiting all night to watch the full version of Bellator 206 and you can’t finally witness the main event.
The San José program contained 13 duels, including six of the main map, and was due to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., just as Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the audience in the UK was stunned when the show changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after they were built until early hours, especially because of the fight.
Fan described on Twitter the switching of the children’s animated film as “some sick joke.”
“The government is regulating that at 6 a.m. this content is inappropriate, so the program was replaced with children’s broadcasting,” said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, in response to a question about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Bellator’s president Scott Cocker said they will work on planning the meetings to include UK audiences in the future.
“I think when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem,” Cocker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday and we can’t plan things so that the event will take place here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't that way, it was government.
I can promise you that next time this won't happen.
We will stick to the inclusion of five fights instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we went too far.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dayley Feels ‘Lower’ Because of His Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling lower than everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started high school, he did not realize that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show's long-standing leader, Curtis Young, has been in hospital for a few months.
While participating in Laverne Daley's first program, he said he felt "less" than all the others as he grew up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said, “Until today, the feeling of inferiority and being different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year’s British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he does this because he is happy that he can live openly, without consequences, and wants to inspire the “hope” of others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – he was “surprised.”
Dale married an Oscar-winning 20-year-old who was 20 years older than him last year, but claims the age difference has never been a problem.
“When you go through so much while you’re so young” – he first participated in the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said, “it’s hard to find someone your age who has experienced such ups and downs.”
They both became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley himself says that "his whole worldview" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, I’d tell you that I’m only interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dale said his father could not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – as he wanted to be in the first place.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be next to me, dad, or on the first line,’” he said.
“I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and at the moment when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that my whole life had been dreaming about it – jumping at the Olympics in front of the audience at home. There was no feeling more terrifying,” he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – “Proud” by Heather Small – that accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympics and still makes him crawl.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 AM British Summer Time.
Michaelson's lost form stays on board for "Rider Bath" on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game in the Rider Cup, but he will have to return to his old form if he doesn’t want his record to be linked to failure.
Michaelson, who participated in the two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the bench by captain Jim Furick for the "Fourball" and "Foursum" games on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure in the U.S. team again, the five-time major tournament winner spent his day as a fan in training his kicks from a distance in the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old, who has never been at the top of his career among the most straightforward players, is not in an optimal shape for Le Golf National’s difficult playground, where the long uneven terrain usually punishes every wrong strike.
And if the playground itself is not worrying enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Michelson will face the precise champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who is in a team with newcomer Tommy Flitwood and seeks to win all of his maths.
If the Americans, who leave with four points before the 12th singles match, make a strong start, it may turn out that Michaelson’s match is absolutely decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his team-mate, though he could hardly say something much different.
“He fully understood his role today, he hugged my back, hugged me and said he was going to be ready tomorrow,” Furick said.
“He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he would play in just two games.
“I expected him to play more, but that’s how he did it, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Michaelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the most games in the "Rider Cup" played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career in the "Rider Bath", which has never come close to his impressive individual achievements.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven matches, but Furick said his presence has other benefits for the team that are not measured by numbers.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, clever, he likes to joke with people, and he’s a great guy for every team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives us much more than just playing.”
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the big front could soon be melted.
The captain of the team, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the big lead accumulated before the singles matches of the last day of the Rider Bath can be easily removed.
The Dutchman made his debut in the "Valderrama" game in 1997, when the team with captain Seve Balisteros led by five points ahead of the Americans, but on the final right was almost knocked out and barely managed to hold the win with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding us that we had a big lead on the National Vallerrama; we had a big lead on the Brookline, where we lost, and on the Vallerrama we won, but it was very difficult,” Björn said, after the Golf 3rd – 5th in 2018.
So the story must show both to me and to everyone in the team that not everything is over.
Get ready for the attack tomorrow.
Go out and do what you have to do.
Nothing is finished until you see the final result on the board.
We have a goal and it's to try to win this trophy and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
“I’ve been thinking about only the 12 players on our team all the time, but we’re also aware of our competitors, who are one of the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of the players at a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never hurry with the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow the individual performances will be on the forefront, and this is different.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out on your own, you’re testing all your skills as a golfer.
This is the message that must reach the players: tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your partner’s back, as he too has to give up to the end.”
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furick will ask his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exceptions being only Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furick himself was on both sides of these great reversals on the last day – he was part of the triumph of Brookline, and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans performed the "Wonder of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999, took his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but it would be nice to make the same good start as you saw at Brookline and Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under a lot of stress.
That’s why we formed our team and distributed our boys the way we want to, so that we try to make the impossible tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory MacKillroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Jan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the top half of the next half.
"I chose these players in this row because I think it gives us the greatest chances of success," Bjorn said of his choice for singles.
Germany Delays Launch of New Warship
The German fleet’s latest fleet frigate was to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the outdated battleships since the Cold War, but this will not be achieved until at least next year due to malfunctioning systems and a headache.
The commissioning of Rheinland-Pfalz, the brand’s new freighter of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes an army spokesman.
The floating ship was due to join the naval forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stellar technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frigates should be able to be used up to two years before returning to home ports.
Continuous delays, however, mean that the avant-garde warships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate overseas power – will already be old when they come into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The accidental F125 frigate entered the title last year when the German navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant “software and hardware defects” that make the warship unusable if sent to a combat mission.
Software shortcomings are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship was significantly overloaded, reducing its efficiency and limiting the ability of the navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including the training of the crew – is also becoming a problem.
It is estimated to have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) – out of the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence commission, admitted that the fleet was actually “depleted from ships capable of carrying out missions.”
The official said that the problem has become bigger over time, as the old ships have been decommissioned, but no new ones have been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could be included in the fleet.
The National Trust Tracks the Secret Life of the Storm
A new study, conducted in a mansion in the Scottish Mountains, aims to establish how ticks use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the frequently encountered stickers, as well as the brown arrowhead waterfalls at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations in the mansion to track the activities of the swamps during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the invoking sounds of the flashes, as well as what types they produce.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Duar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the tides and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of work on habitat management, e.g. the creation of rainforests, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for tides and other related species.
The populations of frogs in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to habitat loss.
A risk to populations may be caused by wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, the eyebrows are not blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a trap.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles along their flight trajectory.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the dams very seriously.
The trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created the first in Scotland and the only special shark reserve in the Threeave mansion in the Dumfries and Galway area, which is home to eight out of ten shark species in Scotland.
David Thompson, the mansion's manager, says it's an ideal territory for them.
“Here, in Threave, we have a great land for the blizzards,” he said.
“We have old buildings, very old trees, and completed suitable habitat.
But there’s a lot more about the cliffs that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better than they need to thrive.”
He stresses that it is important to check for predators before real estate maintenance activities are carried out, as it is possible to inadvertently destroy a shelter to kill up to 400 female and young predators, as well as to destroy a whole local population.
They are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, harass, or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish worker at the Trust for the Preservation of Spiders, encouraged the community to help.
She said, “I still have a lot to learn about our ticks and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what’s going on with their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations and his lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape against him “fake news,” saying people “wanted to become known” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which publishes these allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he then paid her <0x24>375,000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a video on Instagram, addressing its 142 million followers, a few hours after the claims were published, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the post “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball bearer told the camera.
“They want to be famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to accumulate popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations they call “unauthorized publication of suspects in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Sherc said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages to the extent corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The incident is alleged to have occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the soccer player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claimed that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her he was "a good boy" at "99 percent", but in the case he just submitted to "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but it happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "horrified by revenge" and was worried that she would not be "personally hurt".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the deal as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident in question.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will regret forever' losing car manufacturers <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clarke said.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” he said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of the delay on the border in the case of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
At the Burnston plant, where the Auris and Avensis models are manufactured, nearly 150,000 cars were produced last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director at Burnston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says it will close its factory for the Mini in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in the case of a non-trade Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the principle of “exact time,” with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be border problems, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to wait more than one day to fill their inventory at the Darbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May’s “shocking” plan for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
“We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to grab this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio’s 4’s Today program.
“Following the claims not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains.”
Toyota cannot say how long the production will be stopped, but in the longer term they warn that the additional costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Burnston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite Union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “I judge from my experience that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
A spokesman for the government said: “We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says
An extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed by another week" as the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, the ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Chief Prosecutor, or not, and in this way will jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has been fuelling rumors about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting with him was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing before the Senate legal commission, which both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI of the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied, “It’s still not set a date for this, it may be this week, but seeing all the other things that happen in the Supreme Court, I think it might be postponed for the next week.
But we’ll see, and I’m always trying to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters would challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House since September 10.
Broadcaster Chris Wallace asked for the reason.
Sanders responded that the rare press conferences were not due to the “demonstrational behavior” of television journalists, although he shared: “I can’t say that I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior.”
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding, without quoting any evidence: "We've checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but “if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
“We’re trying to do it often, and you’re witnessing it quite often in recent weeks, and that will replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Independent press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior to the gathered journalists.
Minister of Health addresses EU workers at Scotland’s National Health Service on Brexit-related fears <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The health minister has written to EU staff working for the National Health Service of Scotland to express his gratitude to the state and their desire to remain in place after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jean Freeman, sent a letter to the UK less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “In the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very insecure time for all of you.
That is why I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and this is beneficial for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we would very much like to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after receiving head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after receiving a head injury during a meeting on Saturday, when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodors by 31-27, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State Senior Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-life.
“He went to the sideline and somehow just fell there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical professionals gave Abercrombie oxygen to the sideline before it was placed on a carrier and taken to the wardrobe for further examination.
A Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abbercrombie had been discharged from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type/severity of the injury," and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a secondary student with a college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, making a total of 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher shell charge when buying real estate in the UK.
According to the new plans of the Conservatives, foreign buyers will be charged a higher shekel tax when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
State Treasury expects an increase of over <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, which will help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today the decision of foreign buyers to pay a higher shekel tax when buying real estate in the UK, with additional income going to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue will support the government's efforts to limit the number of people who sleep on the street.
The supplement, which is an addition to the current bargaining tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for the purpose of granting, may amount to up to three percent.
The State Treasury expects revenues to rise by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13 percent of London’s newly built buildings are bought by people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for people who buy their property for the first time to interfere in the real estate market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “fantastic cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the herb bill to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by looting land but not using it, and asked Mrs. May to abandon the quotas for affordable housing to fix Britain’s “residential waste.”
Mr. Corbin announced an attractive series of housing reform proposals, including control over rents and the end of expulsions "no blame".
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
“Last year, I shared that I would like to dedicate my time as a prime minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not normal for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes as easily as hard-working people in the UK.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has gone too far in time, and the insult to sleep on the street remains too realistic.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland's team"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "bigest ambition" in his career was to be a senior coach for Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish has taken on the challenge of reviving the club from northeast England, which is currently in third place in the First League, three points from the first place.
He switched to Steady of Light this summer after last season brought St Mirren back to the Scottish Higher League.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded a match for team B and that’s all,” Ross told Scottish BBC Sportsound.
“But I grew up with Hempden’s Scotland matches, which as a child we watched with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
“But this opportunity would only open if I had success at the club level.”
Among Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland are names such as Dick Advocate, David Moises, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Caine, Gus Poyet, and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Aloa Athletic mentor said he did not experience any concern as a heir to such established names at a similar famous club, and he previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question ‘Can I bring this club back to the Higher League?’
Because in terms of structure, base and conditions, he is undoubtedly at the level of the Higher League,” he said.
“It won’t be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I will assume that I have achieved success here only if I can get the team out there again.”
Ross has been manager for only three years, after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts' coaching staff.
He then helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned Saint Mirne from a falling team to a Champions League winner the following season.
Ross shares that he now feels more comfortable than during his football career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“I was really at the crossroads,” he remembers the time when he took Aloe.
“I really believed that being a manager was the best field for me, including before being an active player.
It sounds weird because I did well, I made good money, and I had some significant success.
But being a player is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I’m still facing the same levels of stress and stress at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
"I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I'm really doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin all my conscious life."

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, research reveals
The summer heat has increased the revenues of those struggling to survive British pubs, but has accumulated more tension for the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bar groups reported a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consultant, which compiled the statistics, said: “Due to the prolonged sunny weather and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup, in July, a similar model was obtained as in June, when pubs accounted for more than 8 percent.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubs and drink bars reported the best results in their growth, compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
Feeding puppies also suffered from sunny weather, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales jumped by 6.6 per cent per month, while there was a 3 per cent reduction in food.
Paul Newman, of RSM’s leisure and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and influence of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the service sector outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a drop in sales by 4.8 percent on an annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to regular expenses.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for food business managers, and only the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the desired rest.
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new discoveries, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in branding.

One in five children hide a secret profile from their parents on social media
One in five children – some just 11 – have a secret profile on a social network that they hide from their parents and teachers, a study has revealed.
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows the growth of fake Insta pages
News Increased Fears of Publishing Sexually Contained Materials
Twenty percent of students said they had a “basic” profile that showed their parents.
One in five children – some in 11 – create an account on a social network that is kept secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed growth in fake Insta accounts – a link to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news raised fears that material with sexual content would be published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean “basic” profile that showed their parents, but at the same time they also had secret profiles.
A mother who found herself on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage boy who encouraged others to “rape him.”
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s great that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eileen Doyle Will Be ‘The Voice of Athletes’ on Board of Athletics in Scotland
Eileed Doyle was elected to join the Board of Athletics in Scotland as a non-executive director of the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most accomplished lightweight athlete, and President Ian Beethoven has defined this move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her rich international experience over the past decade.
“Eilid enjoys tremendous respect in the light athletic communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that light athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by attracting it,” said Beatty.
Doyle said: “I have a desire to be the voice of athletes and I really hope to be able to contribute and help promote sports in Scotland.”
The American who won the finals of the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, adding to a total of his four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, lost his ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I got a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show whether and to what extent I will recover.
It was exhausting work, but I got a full recovery, I learned to walk again and today I do exercises for mobility!
“Thank you for encouraging messages!”
Advertising for a milk pump that compares mothers with cows, shares online reviews
The company, which produces milk pumps, shared online opinions with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers with breastfeeding cows.
To mark the launch of the expected “first silent breast pump in the world suitable for wearing”, consumer technology company Elvie has launched a funny music video ad to showcase the freedom that the new pump provides to breastfeeding.
Four real mothers are dancing in a cow’s pond full of yeast, against the background of a song with a lyric, “Yes, I’m breastfeeding, but you don’t see any tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not a hiccup, it’s my breasts.”
The song goes on to say, "Pump, pump, I feed the babies with them, pump, pump, feed my friends."
Advertising, however, posted on the company’s Facebook page caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many claiming to undermine the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after giving birth,” someone wrote.
The Elvie Breast Pump Collected Discreetly in a Breastfeeding Suit (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is completely understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breastfeeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added, "So inadequate advertising."
Others defended the ad by admitting that the song was “extremely funny.”
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
The ejaculation made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit of a mess, but I accept it as it is.
“This product is great,” someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a ridiculous advertisement aimed at mothers who crawl (often in their workplaces or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the clip, the group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet pumps placed in their bra.
The campaign concept is based on the view that many women who are breastfeeding feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely noisy, has no wires or tubes and is gathered discreetly in a nursing baby bra, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they are exhausted.
Anna Ballarin, partner and executive creative director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nurses and dairy cows, we wanted to focus our attention on the drainage of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while at the same time showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has gotten into the news.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium for designer Marta Yakubovski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly moved to tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration’s acute rhetoric and policy has made it difficult for children with guardians.
Typically, most guardians are immigrants without documents who fear they risk their stay in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults in the family would have to provide fingerprints, and this data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior officer at the Immigration and Customs Service, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no previous criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of those who are either guardians, or are members of the guardian’s family, reside illegally in the country, with most of them being foreign criminals.
So we're going to keep chasing these people," Albens said.
In an effort to deal more quickly with the registration of these children, the authorities imposed new rules that require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, rather than 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to staff at the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference call, not in person, to present their case as a legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are identified as inappropriate for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or oppressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to shelter staff and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers shared that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as that in Tornillo, where the signs that a child has problems are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the site.
They added that moving the children to the “palace town” without being given enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., France and Turkey’s ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops are illegally residing in Syrian territory under the pretext of combating terrorism and "where appropriate action will be taken".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Mu'alem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forced out of their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian lands are cleansed” from both terrorist organizations and “any illegal presence of foreigners.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian forces, the opposition of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military personnel in the countries devastated by the war.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said the conditions were tolerable and could be restored, accusing "some Western countries of "swepting groundless fears" that prompted refugees to stand aside.
“We have encouraged the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to these returns,” he said.
“They are turning into a political issue, something that is entirely a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no assistance will be provided to restore Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to halt the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hopes that the military actions will be directed at jihadists, including Al-Qaeda-linked fighters, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, made up of members of the government and the opposition, to draft the post-war constitution of Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the work of the panel should be limited to a "review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why will Trump win a second term?
Under this logic, Trump will win a re-election in 2020, unless – as many viewers from the liberals probably hope – his presidency is terminated prematurely due to impeachment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the rating for the first time has doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during a premiere, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” is at the top of the cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at big news dinners.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC's "Last Candidate" drama, where he talks about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Neal Scully, a veteran comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, “Why?”
Mrs. Scull told me that he replied, "Because he's laughing at me."
There's fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Road versus Wade, whether immigrant families can get together again, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to that in six hours to watch a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Frightening" and "Frightening" by Tsarnatom; the pilot jacket of Paul Manafort's <0x24>15,000 "Frightening" by Tsarnault.
I'll never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
“Part of what he’s doing to make you feel like a part of a reality show is to give you a little bit of every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and co-founder of the “Pawn Stars” magazine, Chennai.
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're going to miss it.
When I contacted Mr. Flies this week, he was sunny, 80 degrees on the north coast of Kawai, but he had closed his house to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not separate himself from the TV, especially when Brett Kavanaugh had to face the legal committee of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.

Investments plunge into the most controversial race in early congressional elections
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives a stream of money, thanks to the rearrangement of the Districts of Congress and hence two titles for the same place.
The recently redistributed district in the suburbs of Pittsburgh is named by Conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in partial elections last spring.
Lamb is facing another title holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly endorsing the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordered in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the main funding institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Commission on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb is celebrating in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The position has been occupied by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district with 20 points.
Political experts believe that democrats have a slight advantage.
The U.S. is considering imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, after which it withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to revoke the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” Heather Nauert, a spokesman for Departat, said earlier this month.
But sanctions were only foreseen against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid to fight drugs for development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including a cut in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American state with its unemployment rate and murder rate.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which serves as a continuation of a similar gathering from the previous year, considered a step forward.
But by mid-September, the senior governing bodies clarified that their wish was to hold the conference, effectively halting any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has now announced that he will attend the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next step could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, and the report is currently significant evidence in the public register.
It is alleged that Mr. Mueller is directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump has conspired with Russia during his campaign to attack our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to be accountable to this body, just as he is preparing to face the voters, as well as perhaps to court hearings made up of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I am not suggesting that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of those like him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make those choices that will affect how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, as long as the West had fought against him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of the massacre.
The course of history depends on such moments, and the immutable march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
At the moment, Americans are facing a number of similar challenges at the moment.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been shattered since the newspaper reported last year that he had offered to secretly write down the president and had speculated that it was not suitable for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the story in The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Kavanaugh, demanded by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved in the Supreme Court despite the charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the early elections for Congress if this will force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe we're not going to fail because I've learned my lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table wearing a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about collision with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory over the Austrians after Spain's impressive equality against Vilareal earlier this month would give them a significant chance to move forward from Group G to the Europa League.
The knee injury did not allow Defender Graham Dorans to play his first game of the season before the 2-2 draw with Vilareal, but he believes that for Rangers this result could turn into a trampoline for greater achievements.
“We have won an important point because Villarreal is a good opponent,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game with the hope that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall the equality seems to be a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second.
We’ve been looking at Thursday, another big night of our games in Europe.
I hope we can fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the last match, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do everything we can and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely difficult after everything that happened along my injuries and changes in the club, but now things seem to have moved in the direction of the rules.
The team is good and the guys really have fun, the workouts are beneficial.
I hope that we will be able to do our best to forget last season and achieve the desired success."
Women Are Worried About Their Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey shared that they had discussed with their husbands the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent have spoken to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to conduct this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance sector at Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care for you if you don’t make your wishes in advance.
Together with your advisor and your family, discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay for these costs.
Your decisions when you choose a financial institution for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with a monetary value to help you with these expenses, or self-insurance with your funds.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles from the very beginning.
Appoint yourself a health care agent so that you have a certain trustee who oversees your medical care and ensures that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the idea of a Financial Officer.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your adult parent needs emergency medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Explain these details in writing so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just about the financial aspect, it’s also about who the doctors will be,” Martin asks.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan.”

Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to increase.
Due to interrupted communications, aid organizations could not receive information from the Dongal regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongal, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow beachside on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary, when the earthquake and tsunami escalated.
Dongala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) along the coastal edge of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is an administrative region smaller than a province, has an approximate population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundations of the economy of central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Acquiring nickel is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Moravali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesian disaster recovery agency data.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
The tsunami struck the western part of Dongal, killing nine people in 1996.
Indonesia is located on the seismical "Pacific Fire Ring" and is regularly plagued by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe tsunami on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a wave of tsunami that ravaged 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the coastline of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in the Aegean.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude truss strikes the most populous island in Indonesia, Java, triggering a tsunami that shattered the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 hits near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawa and triggered a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A tile earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remembered the devastations of the 2004 deadly earthquakes and tsunamis.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Violent thunderstorms hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The quake has destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in ruins.
Sarah Paylin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trak Pailin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Pailin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Pailin, 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and resistance in arrest, according to a Alaska state police report published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female known woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her off the phone.
Pailin was detained in the Mat-Su Pre-Detention Building and under an unsecured <0x24>500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, stating he was "innocent, certainly" when asked for pleas, the media reported.
Pailin is threatened with a three-offensive penalty, which means he could be deprived of his liberty for up to a year and pay a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He is also charged with a class B crime, which is punishable by one day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Pailene.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pailin.
His mother, Sarah Pailin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being dealt with by the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence, and possession of weapons under the influence of intoxicating substances in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he hit her in the face with a fist.
Sarah Pailine was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress from his Iraqi service.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Dead
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been disrupted, with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
In social networks, videos are spinning, which show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami wave raged on the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspect in Terrorist Attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal offence.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out the attack in October on a bicycle lane near the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, sneaking pedestrians and cyclists along the way.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injuries, according to the Yorky Penalty Notice in connection with the request for the death penalty.
According to the court document, both charges could end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an expanded federal judiciary filed a 22-point prosecution with Saipov, including eight counts of murder related to a racket commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of indictment.
The attack required “serious planning and deliberation,” the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov was carried out as “horrible, cruel and perverse”.
"Saifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Laurie Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Ernan Feluchi, and Alejandro Damian Panukako."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York sought the death penalty for the last time.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers, but was subsequently sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was executed in New York was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a two-year sentence for conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek national, did not show a sense of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was feeling good about what was done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIL clips on his phone, the prosecutor said.
He also asked his hospital room to put the flag of ISIS, police said.
He pleaded innocent under the indictment, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“In our view, the decision to seek a death sentence instead of accepting a sentence for guilt and life imprisonment without the possibility of premature release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all affected people,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecutor’s office not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Findel Farage Should Lead Brexit Negotiations <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Nigel Farage has vowed to “mobilize the army of the people” today, during a protest at the Conservative conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should “feel pressure” as one of May’s own party members suggested he head the EU negotiations.
Peter Bonn, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain would have “been out so far” if Mr Farage was Brexit’s secretary.
But the challenge Mrs. May faced to agree with the deeply divided ranks of the party was highlighted by conservatives supporting the stay, who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan "Chequers", despite the attacks by Brexit-backed, EU-backed stays.
The Allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and urge Eurosceptics and Labourers to choose between its package and the “chaos”.
Mr. Bonn told protesters with the slogan “Exit means exiting” in Solihull that he wanted to “discard the Chequers.”
He pointed out that Mr Farage had to participate in the same way as everyone else and that he had to be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he were the leader, we would have left," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw away the Chequers plan.
Declaring his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be laborers.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bon rejects the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The understanding that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative spokeswoman Andrea Jenkins also took part in the rally, saying to reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Mrs. Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, he is not popular with our party and our activists who actually went out to the street and really helped us be elected.
Please stop "Chequers" and start listening. "
In an open message to Ms May, she added: “Prime Ministers retain their position when they keep their promises.”
Farage said at the rally that politicians should “feel pressure” if they plan to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
“It’s now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to change Brexit and we’ve gathered here today to say, ‘We’re not going to let this go away.’
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, feel pressure.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, the supporters of the stay went on a hike through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A handful of activists have raised flags with the inscription “Conservatories vs. Brexit” after the group launched this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis spoke with the Conservatives about the security issues of the party's application when it opened at the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can deploy the IT systems and all of Canada’s technology, and more, and more, for crossing borders without obstacles, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren says he will “think seriously” his candidacy for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has announced that he will “seriously consider the possibility of running for president” after the November election.
Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican representative Jeff Dile, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the center of speculation that she could take the post of Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holiouk was her 36th meeting with voters in the mayor's building after Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was time for “women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, and that includes women at the top.”
He was arrested for the death of Simms from LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, on Saturday announced that there was a suspect in the shooting on Friday when LSU basketball player Wade Sims was killed.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson during a press conference at 11:00 Eastern Time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man on the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the University of the South area early in the morning on Friday.
"Wade Sims was shot in the head, eventually leading to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to the crime scene, had a gun, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was imprisoned and detained in the police department of the Eastern Baton Rouge municipality.
A 6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2>6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge – Sims participated in 32 games with 10 appearances as a title last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Grand Prix of Russia: Louis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team's instructions helped him defeat Sebastian Fetel
As soon as Walter Bottas was ranked ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes's directions would play an important role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two turns, allowing Fetel to attack his team.
Fetel first made a pit-stop and allowed Hamilton to deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be decisive for the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit-stop on the next lap and went after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to beat him after a daring maneuver and tyre-to-tyre driving, which forced Ferrari's pilot to ride a mantle with a reluctance to free the inner part of the lap as a lap-to-hand.
Over his 21st birthday Max Verstappen started from the back rows of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
Afterwards, he even ran for quite a long period of time since he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly beat Kimi Raikkonen in the fourth-place battle.
He finally made a pit-stop in the 44th round, but failed to score enough in the next eight rounds and eventually finished fourth in Rykonen.
It was a tough day, because Walter did a great job the whole weekend and made himself a real gentleman when he let me beat him.
"The team has done an exceptional job to win the first two places on the podium," Hamilton said.
It was really a bad body language.
President Donald Trump sneered at Senator Dayan Finnstein at a rally on Saturday over her claim that she did not disseminate a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, accusing Supreme Court plaintiff Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During rally talks in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on how what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “bad and disgusting, and dishonest.”
“What can happen is the good that has happened in the Senate in the last few days, when you see anger, when you see angry people and bad people, and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at publications and distributions, and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you understand?
Diane Finnstein, have you spread out?
Do you remember her answer... Did you release the document – “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... No, we didn’t spread,” he added, imitating the senator.
Finnstein sent the letter detailing Ford’s claims against Kavanaugh in July, which was circulated earlier in September – but Finnstein denied that the letter had occurred from her office.
"I have not covered Ford's claims, I have not spread its story," Finnstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep privacy, and I kept it as she wanted.”
But the denial on her part was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: “I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the claimant to the Supreme Court, charged with sexual crimes against three women, the president said Democrats are using the claims for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means possible.
Look at the dishonesty, the shamelessness, they don’t care who they’re going to hurt, who they’re going to have to beat to regain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Juventus against Dundee
Dundee Stars came back for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Juventus, winning a 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
Jayants led early in a two-goal match after hitting Patrick Dwayer and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney equated for the hosts before Dwyer regained Justice's lead.
Francoa Bushar scored for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nilsen’s two goals solidified their victory.
This is the third Elite League win for Adam Keef’s boys who got out of the bottom to beat Dundee in Belfast by 2-1 on Friday night.
This was the fourth clash between opponents this season, with Jayants winning the previous three games.
The strike, with which Dwyer found the result, came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 p.m., with the assistance of Candle McFaul, and then David Ruderford doubled the lead, assisting Bovilier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped to level up with Kauny at 15:16.
Dwyer tried to lead Jayants before the first break, marking a second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar again leveled his chances with a powerful knock on the door at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nilsen give Dundy a lead in this match for the first time at the end of the second half, giving his best and affirming the team's win with a fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
Jayants, who have lost the last four matches of a total of five matches, will host Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
A flight manager has died to ensure that hundreds of people on board the plane can escape from an earthquake.
A flight manager in Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many were unknown in a powerful earthquake that struck Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a wave of tsunami.
Strong secondary swarms continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues ran to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the heavily shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufrey Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, would be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided it was going down.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian Air Control spokesman Johannes Syrith said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of deaths could reach thousands after the country’s disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong was restricted.
“We expect that the number of deaths will increase, as many bodies are still under the debris, and many people cannot be reached,” said the agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that reached six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
There's bullshit everywhere in the mini-markets."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?", CNN said.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reports that one person is unknown after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which carried out a flight by plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon, now reports that one person has been declared missing after previously saying all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon they could not contact a male passenger.
The airline added that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more passenger details, such as age and nationality.
Boats of local people helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were admitted to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, says the plane went very low.
“It’s very nice,” Janes said.
Janes says he and the rest of the crew managed to sneak through the deep water to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He shared that the stewards had panicked and were screaming, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy says sailors repairing a nearby harbor also helped in the rescue effort by using an inflatable boat to take people to the shore before the plane sinks into the depths of about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Safe Aviation Network indicates that over the past two decades 111 people have died in airline flights registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyst exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office closed its case statement on Saturday in a repeat trial against a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulette of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old prosecutor Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulette said it had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time, when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford went to court on Saturday and testified that he was outside the city on that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said it was "a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Telis said she knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
Records from mobile phones indicate that they have only known each other for a week.
Roulette pointed out that shortly after the death of Chambers Telis, she deleted her text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin with its closing remarks on Sunday.
The judge said that he expects the trial to be presented to the courts later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is a Conscious Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative opinions about the genre by performing your music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that the hip hop has deviated from its origin of political statements and engagement with social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and popularize conscious hip-hop again.
The Fugees and Common performers are reborn in the UK through performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New York midwife sues a couple after being fired for “racist” message
A New York midwife sued a couple for dismissal for discrimination after receiving a wrongly sent message from her mother, who complained that she was "the next black woman".
The couple denied being racist, resembling a desire for “extortion.”
Lensy Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEE, THE RED BLACK COAT,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman, who was feeling "unpleasant", fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the former African-American midwife had not done her job well and that she was expecting the New York Post, a philippine woman.
Mrs. Morris was rewarded for one working day and then sent home with a taxi.
Morris now sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal, demanding the sum of <0x24>350 a day for the six-month contract she was originally hired for, even though she had no contract.
“I want to show them, see, you shouldn’t do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “You’re sure that’s discrimination.”
In response to the request, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that Maurice’s termination of employment was a reasonable act, as they feared that they would not be able to trust her after she was insulted.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco, his husband, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have offended, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Similarly to an “extortion,” Plasco claims that his wife gave birth only two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“You’re going to attack someone in this state?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
While the court case is still in the process of consideration, public opinion quickly condemns the couple on social networks, denying them for their behavior and logic.
Publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not have felt a connection to a speaking bear, reveals new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, says of the letter: “It is difficult to sit in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It's a lot of fun now that we're aware of Paddington's huge success."
She shared that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before she was inspired to write the children's book for a little bear-toy, would feel optimistic about a possible rejection of the book, adding that she "welcome the 60th anniversary."
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as “an important member of our family,” she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
“He was a very humble man and was not self-centered,” she said.
“But since you felt Paddington so real, it’s like having a child who has achieved something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your business.
I think he somehow accepted Paddington's success this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought to save her life in vain.
"He was constantly calling to say that the situation is really bad, that he doesn't expect to survive," Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz said.
“Then Nad called me to say that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be back to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by doctors to maintain her heart slowly stop acting and leave her system.
She's gone a while before that, and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get tight.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who has so far mourned the loss of her daughter, boards the plane along with the other passengers who have no idea what the test is going through.
“No one understands,” she says.
“I was shaking my head and all the time my tears were dripping.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her.”
Snoring Women Put Cards to Prevent Suicide from Bridge
Two women, who lost their loved ones due to suicide, try to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wales cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45, from Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him with a smile.
It was always said that his smile illuminated every room.”
However, he resigned from his job before leaving, and was in a “very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that this will have some consequences."
Mrs. Davis creates the cards, “so that people know who to go to and who to talk to, even if this is a friend.
Don’t shut up, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, loses Mark, her 15-year-old companion, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t share that he felt depressed or depressed or anything else,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his attitude.
He got to the bottom of Christmas — when the kids opened their gifts, he didn’t look at them or anything.”
She said it was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “This opens up a gap in the family.
It breaks us.
But we have to move on and fight.”

Bret Kavanaugh's future is in question after the FBI's investigation begins.
I wondered if we really could achieve what he wants — an investigation of limited duration and limited scope — maybe we could unite our efforts,” Fleck said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the commission would “disintegrate” despite the tightened supremacy.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters ask the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their unwillingness is due to the moment itself.
The early elections are only five weeks later, on 6 November – if Republicans don’t present themselves well, they will seriously undermine their attempts to elect their representative to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called on senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has prepared its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of refugees ‘decreases’ by Kim
South Korean lawmakers say the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are key factors.
There are no official comments from Pyongyang.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually get citizenship in South Korea.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and is crossed more easily than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) that divides the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriated them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of both sides met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stagnation in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work jointly for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ree Young Ho, accused the United States of lack of progress since then.
“With a lack of trust in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first way to unilaterally discredit ourselves,” Mr. Ree said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit for the Supreme Court's office.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was too unbalanced to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"There was no way I could not think that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would have called her 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate jury on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when both were teenagers.
During his inaugural speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times he almost screamed and felt when discussing his family and his school years.
He also categorically condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated attack on the personality", organized by liberals who are dissatisfied that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi pointed out that, according to her, Kavanaugh’s testimony proves that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it became clear that he was preconceived about the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with these claims and the way he pursues the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and in case Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say it that way – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s unwilling not only to go to the Supreme Court, but also to the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential rulings regarding the Accessible Health Care Act or the Row vs. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavano avoided the question of whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, persuasive person to come to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that great?’”
And women need to be able to control themselves.
It’s a reasonable criticism, after months and years of spreading anger, and she can’t accept it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinm told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, “I got a huge help from a woman who was the CEO somewhere, who shared that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she was angry and crying because she was crying, she said to her interviewer, “You can think about it.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
“I thought it was genius.”
Tears are allowed when expressing anger, in part because they misunderstand each other at first.
One of my clearest recollections of previous work, in an office mostly with men, is how once, while I was whispering with inexpressible anger, a woman older than me caught me by the door—a scorching leader that I was always a little afraid of—and I was afraid of.
“Never let them see you crying,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy that they did it to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a yacht called "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the competition, Mrs. Schröder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later, laughing.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was to show up another one.
Someone called the situation "The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs".
As she is late in the campaign, she is delayed with raising funds and decides she will not stay in the race if she fails to raise <0x24>2 million.
The battle was pre-condemned to failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give <0x24>1,000 to men, would give only <0x24>250 to her.
“Do you think I’m getting a discount?” she asked.
During her speech in which she stated that she would not continue with an official campaign, she was filled with so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system, which made it so difficult to get money, to be able to turn to the electorate.
“You might think I’ve had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schröder recalls how the media reacted.
“Someone might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my graveyard?
“She’s crying?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Serve Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were overwhelming, and while the battle is still accelerating, a break-up between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shell this year, taxing key elements of China’s exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tensions came this week with new tariffs affecting <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in production, effectively taxing half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Every time Beijing reversed new tariffs with five to ten percent of U.S. goods for <0x24>60 billion.
China has vowed to turn back on every U.S. strike, and it is not expected soon that the world’s second-largest economy will overlook this.
To get Washington to give up means to surrender to the demands, but to put a head in public before Washington would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet experts say if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressure from the trade war with the United States could help China in the long run with decreasing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing could create conditions for an economic crisis in any of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, a collaborative scientist.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister said
Syria said it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and called for assistance in restoring the country devastated by the war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastated by terrorists to bring them back to their normal state.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and food.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in the restoration of the devastated country.
But he stressed that no conditional support or assistance will be accepted from countries that financed the rebels.
Europe wins Rider Bath in Paris <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, overtaking the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
So the US has six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won the "Rider Bath" in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its championship crown in the tournament after the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the necessary 14.5 points that secured victory over the United States.
U.S. star Phil Michelson, who played poorly during most of the tournament, sent his first hit to the 16th hole (with a pair of 3) in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has performed well in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the tournament's history, reaching a 5-0-0 balance since the race was held in its current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Spite categorically lost by 5&4 to the player in the team of Europe, which is the lowest in the rankings – Torbjörn Olesen from Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Paulter of England, for whom this is probably the last participation of the "Rider Bath".
Sergio García, a veteran with eight entries in the Rider Cup, became the European with the most points in the tournament of all time, increasing his asset to 25.5 points this year.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stand today.
It's been a tough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to be able to raise the cup again.
“The most important thing is the team and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said after Europe’s victory.
He handed over the staff to his fellow countryman John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 on Sunday's singles.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching him play,” Ram, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four matches in France, and his overall balance on the Ryder Cup is 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, he won 14 major titles – an indicator that he only relinquishs Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team had been struggling all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who showed high-class golf on all days of the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furick said after the team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At one time this morning, we pressed the European team.
There was a battle.
I'm dropping Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, discuss the important issues with the U.S. Association of Professional Golfers and our Rider Bath Committee, and we will only look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can't get your opponent's hat down.
“We were just overjoyed.”
