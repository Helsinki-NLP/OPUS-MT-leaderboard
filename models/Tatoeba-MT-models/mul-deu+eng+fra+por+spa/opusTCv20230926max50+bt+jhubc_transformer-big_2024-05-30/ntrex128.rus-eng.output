Members of the Wales Assembly do not want to “go to the Mappets”
Some members of the National Assembly are dissatisfied with the proposal to adopt the abbreviation MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Parliament of Wales) for their appointment.
The problematic solution is related to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties will be concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One of the Labourers, expressing his party’s opinion, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “reflects Twp and Pwp.”
For our readers not from Wales: in Welsh, twp means "stupid", and pwp means "stupid".
According to a member of the Assembly from the Wales Party, his organization as a whole was “unhappy” and suggested other options.
Representatives of the Conservative Party "do not object" to the new abbreviation, but note that the MWP is close to the word Muppet (mappet).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced roughly like the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a bill on the change of name, made the following statement: “The final decision on how the Members of the Assembly will be appointed will, of course, remain behind them.”
The Wales Governance Act of 2017 authorizes the National Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the "Parliament of Wales" option instead of the "Assembly" found broad support among the local population.
As for the nomination of members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while the MWP option received the most public support.
Apparently, the members of the Assembly are proposing other options, but it will be difficult for the Chairperson, Elina Jones, to find a suitable solution for everyone.
The reform laws will include other modifications to the Assembly's working process, including new rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and the establishment of the Committee's system.
Members of the Assembly shall vote in favour of the final version of their nomination in the course of the debate on the draft law.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted to rename the country to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The vote is aimed at solving a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name "Republic of Macedonia" implies territorial claims to the Greek province, and has repeatedly opposed its northern neighbor's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he will not recognize its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, noted that changing the country’s name is the price of joining the EU and NATO.
Crisis in the arrivals of Garlem: the bell of St. Martin has been silenced forever
“The elders of the area I was talking to were saying that there was a bar and a church in every corner before,” Adams says.
“Now there is nothing else left.”
The disappearance of the bars can still be understood:
“The format of communication has changed.”
“The bar has ceased to be a kind of living room of the whole neighborhood where they came regularly.”
But as for the churches, there is concern that the funds received from the sale of assets will not be long enough, no matter how much their leaders rely on it. “Sooner or later they will be left with nothing.”
At the site of the church, he added, will appear a multi-storey house, whose residents are unlikely to support the surviving arrivals in the area.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” says Adams, “and this will be the day when such churches will finally close because new neighbors will never become their neighbors.”
Both churches were built by white congregations even before Harlem became a black area: the Metropolitan Communities in 1870, and St. Martin's Church - 10 years later.
The first members of the Methodist church left the arrival in the 30s of the last century.
Their building was redeemed by a black settler, located nearby.
When the church of St. Martin was taken over by the black community, it was led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, the main commercial artery of Harlem, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
In 1939, as a result of the fire, the building was severely damaged, and during the restoration work, Johnson's stepfather ordered the installation of a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, who succeeded him as head of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "the bells for the poor."
But the expert, who tested the carillon in July, called it differently: “cultural heritage” and “unique historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was a carillon from St. Martin's Church that was the first instrument of its kind in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago he was invited to play on a larger carillon in Rivas.
According to Merriezer, the church of St. Martin has yet to find a replacement for him.
In the last few months around St. Martin’s Church, there has been a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by the secular leaders of the church, others – the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
The parishioners' assembly, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, in July addressed the diocese, expressing concern that the diocese "try to transfer the value of the works" to the parishioners' parishes, although the latter had no relation to the election.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark wounded a 13-year-old diver who manufactured lobster mining
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, in California, a 13-year-old diver was attacked by a shark and suffered bodily injuries.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Bicon Beach in Ensinitas.
As Ched Hammel told in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego) station, on Saturday morning he was snorkeling with friends and about half an hour later heard the boy's cries for help. Together with friends they floated on the boat.
According to Hammel, at first he decided that the boy was loudly happy to catch the lobster, but quickly “he realized that he was screaming, “I was bitten!
They bite me!”
Swimming with the diver, Hammel noted that "he had completely broken the skin around the key."
“I yelled everyone out of the water, ‘Here is a shark!’” says Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Redi Children's Hospital (San Diego); his condition is assessed as critical.
The species of shark attacking a teenager is unknown.
The rescuer of Captain Larry Gails said during a press briefing that a shark had been spotted in this place a few weeks ago, but was not referred to as a dangerous species.
Gailz also added that the victim of the attack suffered injuries to the upper part of the skull.
Authorities have blocked the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ensinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and ensure the safety of the population.
Hayles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sensbury plans to conquer the perfumery and cosmetic market in the UK
Landsbury is set to establish cosmetics and perfumery departments in Boots, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with cosmetologists consultants, according to the model of luxury stores.
The perfumery and cosmetic market of the UK is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to expand, while in the field of fashion and goods for the home sales are falling. To capture a significant share of this desired market, a lot of them will be sold as an experiment in all 11 stores.
Supermarket owners are looking for what to fill shelves, previously unfurled under TVs, microwave ovens, home goods, and investment in the perfume and cosmetics market are a good solution.
According to representatives of Seinsbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetic products to 3,000 names; including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be offered for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by the type of organization of goods in Boots stores.
In addition, the company’s line of products “Boutique Cosmetics” will be reorganized with the transition to vegan products to meet the demands of young buyers.
Two of the shops will feature fragrance shop kiosks: the first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second is expected to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online commerce and the tendency to buy small amounts of products on a daily basis in small stores near the home have led to the fact that supermarkets are forced to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, president of Sainesbury, says outlets will gradually become universe-made, and its supermarket network is battling for buyers in a competitive fight with cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food goods.
Hundreds of supermarkets in Sainsbury host Argos outlets, and in some of them you can now find Habitats stores since the network acquired both brands two years ago. This led to increased sales of food products and revenues due to these acquisitions.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to give a new life to its cosmetic and pharmacy departments were unsuccessful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture was organized between Siensbury and Boots, but later there was disagreement between the participants on the dividend of the proceeds from the sale of pharmacy products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Selesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy’s network, sold the pharmaceutical business of Seinsbury (a total of 281 stores) for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skin care products to La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of SANISBERRY, said: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more favorable environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants, who will always be ready to help by the council.
Our range of brands for any taste, pleasant design and convenient location of shops will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumes. This will be a completely new concept of shopping.”
Peter Jones reacted “rageously” to Holly Willowby’s exit from the 11-million-pound deal
The show star "The Dragon's Mouth" Peter Jones is "enraged" by the exit of TV host Hallie Willowby from the 11 million-pound deal she was planning to enter with the live-style brand Peter, but instead preferred new contracts and ITV Scarlett.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their joint brand of homewear and accessories True.
The business of the couple was compared to the Goop brand by actress Gwinnett Paltrow.
The 37-year-old leading program “This Morning” announced its decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby’s decision to leave their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV has angered Peter Jones, the Dragon’s Lobster.
According to our sources, Jones was "raged" when a TV viewer's favorite during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his business-imperial headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that their time was not as much as <0x24>1.5 million and that after concluding their new contracts, they were not worth more than <0x24>1.5 million.
Their brand was compared to the child of actress Gwyneth Peltrow by the brand Goop, and it was expected that her sales would double Willoughby's worth, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
The 37-year-old leader announced his departure from Instagram, and Jones himself left the UK on a private plane to one of his villas.
According to one source, “Truely was Halli’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure her carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Its decision led to the loss of all participants in the transaction.
Everyone was shocked by what happened on Tuesday, because there were a few weeks left before the launch of the brand.
There was a whole warehouse in Marlowe, filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that taking care of the leading "This Morning", one of the UK's most popular stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds due to significant investments in goods: from pillows and candles to clothes, as well as a potential delay.
In addition, it is a breakdown of long-standing friendships.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Bolduin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Cape for 10 years.
Willowby created the True brand together with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, chaired the company's board in March.
Both couples often spend holidays together, and in addition, Jones owns 40% of the television production firm Dan Bolduin.
Willowby will become M&S ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as the lead of ITV's "I'm a Celebrity."
A source from nearby Jones said last night, “We can’t comment on his commercial affairs.”
Difficult negotiations, “and then we loved each other”
He joked about the criticism he was being criticized by the media for “unworthy president” comments and a positive assessment of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up on so many claims?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news leader.
“Nothing that I didn’t give up.”
He noted that Kim Jong-un was interested in a reunion after Trump called their first summit in Singapore in June a significant step on the way to reducing nuclear stockpiles in North Korea.
But talks about denuclearization have gone awry.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high-ranking North Korean diplomat Lee Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at a UN General Assembly meeting on Saturday with a statement that North Korea is still awaiting the "responsibility" of U.S. responses.
Instead, the U.S., the diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as a leverage of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
“North Korea is doing great,” he said.
“We were on the verge of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have a great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-un have been fruitful: an end to missile tests, hostages have been released, and U.S. military personnel remaining in North Korea have also returned to their homeland.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, Trump stressed that there is nothing odd about his unusual approach to diplomacy.
“Behaving like the president is so easy, but instead of the 10,000 people on the street who get into this completely crowded hall, there would be only 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathering in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: catastrophic disasters recorded, hundreds of victims
In the first days after the earthquake that struck Lombok, foreign NGOs said they did not need their help.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population has been left without a roof over their heads, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national disaster, which is a mandatory requirement for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they didn’t need international support, so it wasn’t easy,” Sambung said.
Rescue Children is preparing a team to be sent to Palu, but we do not yet know if a foreign team will be able to work on the spot.
According to Mr. Sutopo, official representative of the National Office for the Elimination of Natural Disasters, Indonesia ' s leadership is evaluating the situation in Palu in order to determine the appropriateness of the involvement of international organizations.
Given the constant seismic instability in Indonesia, the country is still horribly poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Although Tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite warning of the threat of tsunami, there was no siren to alert the population in Palu, which most likely resulted in such a large number of casualties.
Transportation between the numerous Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The floating hospital, previously stationed in Lombok to assist earthquake victims, is heading to Palu, but the road to the site of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidodo has made strengthening Indonesia’s old infrastructure the main point of his election campaign and has spent countless money on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, who is voting for a new term next year, has plunged into funding problems.
The president is also criticized for exacerbating interfaith enmity between Indonesia’s conservative Muslim majority and the rest of the population.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands more have lost their lives as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed mosques, arrows with arrows and other self-propelled weapons.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge compares the score in the match against Chelsea goal in the far top corner of the goal
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the 89th minute of the Premier League match against Chelsea, which was held on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge received a pass from Jordan Shakiri about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal when his team lost 1-0.
He moved to the left and pierced into the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and felt in the far upper corner of the net.
The goalkeeper Kepa Arrisabalaga jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Starridge said: “It was all about being in this position and getting the ball, players like Shak are always playing the maximum of the attack, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible.”
"I saw that Kante was heading to me, took the ball and, thinking for a short time, broke through the gate."
Following the results of the first half of the match, Chelsea led with a score of 1-0, a goal in the 25th minute scored by Belgian Eden Azar.
Central attacker Chelsea, passing the pass back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, broke through the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
In the middle of the field Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> played a game with one touch.
He then handed the pass to Azar, who went out to the gate.
Azar bypassed the defense and from the left flank hit Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker, hitting the far corner of the net.
Liverpool will face the team of Naples in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will be held at San Paolo Stadium in Naples (Italy) on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA Euroleague match, which will take place on Thursday in London, also at 3:00 p.m.
The number of victims of Indonesian tsunami has increased to 832
The number of victims of the quake and subsequent tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, the National Disaster Reduction Authority said on Sunday morning.
According to reports, under the ruins of buildings destroyed as a result of an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale, there are many people left. The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused tsunamis with waves of up to 6 meters of height.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000 people, was devastated by the collapse of houses.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of inflicting deadly knife wounds on a woman
A woman's body was found this morning in the town of Birkenhead, county of Merseyside, and the murder is being investigated.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with ribbed wounds was found at 7:55 p.m. at Grayson Muzes complex on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder among locals.
Criminal Police Inspector O’Hagen said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I strongly ask anyone who was in the John Street area of Birkenhead who could observe or hear anything suspicious, to contact us.
I’m also addressing everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have captured something on the video recorder. Please contact us with any information that can help with the investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the victim was living in Birkenhead and her body was found on the territory of the complex.
This afternoon, the suspected victims came to the scene to ask their questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway, and the police are preparing to report the tragedy of the victim’s closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in the Grayson Muse complex, tried to enter his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
When he learned what had happened, he lost his speech.
Residents were told that they would not be able to get home for at least a few hours.
One of the police officers told the resident that the entire surrounding area was considered the scene of the crime.
One woman was crying.
“What a horror!” she repeated.
At 2 a.m., two police buses arrived at the scene, and another one remained outside the fenced zone.
Several police officers were placed inside the fence to watch over the apartment complex.
Anyone who has any information is asked to send a personal message to the <0x40>MerPolCC subscriber on Twitter, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 (Case 247 of September 30).
Cromwell’s monument in front of the parliament building sparked a fierce debate about “rewriting history”
Cromwell’s “Expulsion” would be a deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of England’s numerous cultural and religious artifacts by its followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, Cromwell’s Society of Memory called Mr. Crick’s proposal “crazy” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “As part of the ongoing debates on the demolition of historical monuments, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace has inevitably arisen.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the iconoclastic movement during the English Civil Wars.
Oliver Cromwell is likely to suffer for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent Cromwell statue of Sir William Hamo Tornicroft reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man, which many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith said: “Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case – the monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of the debate of experts.
But it can be said with certainty that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century affected the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this section.
His achievements as a Lord Protector also deserve high appreciation and respect.”
Chinese farmer's death stings killer pig
In one of the markets in southwestern China, a farmer has become a pig victim, local media reported.
The victim's bloody body (in the media only mentions his name, "Yuan") with a broken artery was found next to a wheat market in the Lupanshui district of Guizhou province in southern China.
Pigs are preparing to be vaccinated on a pig farm, May 30, 2005, in Xinin County, China's Qinghai Province.
Yuan and his cousin came from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, a cousin found Yuan's breathless body, while the door to the neighboring pork barn was opened.
In the pig shop there was a huge crab with blood on the ridge.
In the course of the forensic medical examination, it was found that a pig weighing 250 kilograms killed a farmer.
"My brother's legs were bleeding and stained," a relative of the man killed told Guiyang Evening News.
The video from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig did not belong to the brothers.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate plot during the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
Yuan's family is reportedly negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the farmer's death.
There are rare cases of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, Massachusetts, injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound animal hung a Welsh peasant on a tractor and let go, just frightened by his well-off wife.
In 2012, a case was recorded when a farmer from Oregon in the U.S. was eaten by his own pigs. As one Canadian farmer told CBC News, the pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of the blood can act on their hidden aggression as a "lowering mechanism".
"Pigs play,
They're cute and very curious, but they're not meant to hurt you.
You just need to bring your animal a sense of measure and respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rainfall to much of the southwestern United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is losing power by moving across the cooler water zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring rains and flooding to the territory of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York City, the cyclone reached category 1 with winds of up to 135 km/h, located 360 km southwest of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east to the western coast of the United States. Approaching the coast of the state of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico, to the territory of the U.S. South.
More than 25 cm of rainfall is expected in Mexico on Monday.
Under the influence of tropical humidity, which has entered the forming low-pressure zone, heavy rainfall in the Southwest is expected in the coming days.
Rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous rainstorms, muddy streams and possible slippages in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to high tropical humidity, precipitation rates can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some parts of the southwestern United States, mostly in most of Arizona, up to 5–10 cm of precipitation is expected.
The risk of sudden rapidly developing floods due to the uneven distribution of tropical rains is not excluded.
With the existing risk of tropical rainfall, walking in the desert is plagued with serious consequences.
The canyons can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and the thunderstorm can cause swirling winds and raise a cloud of dust.
With the emergence of a low-pressure zone, the places on the coast of southern California will be flooded.
It is possible to drop up to 1.5 cm of rainfall, which can cause small muddy streams and create slippery surfaces on roads.
It is the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and on Monday mornings, tropical rains will take place in Arizona, which will spread to other territories until Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the rainfall will take place in the Quatre Corners area and will continue until midnight.
In October, there will be sharp temperature drops across the U.S. due to low air temperatures in the Arctic with sufficiently high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes such a combination leads to strong temperature fluctuations in a small area.
Such sharp temperature drops will be particularly noticeable in the central part of the U.S. on Sunday.
Between temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa, there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
In most of the central and eastern U.S. territories, warm weather is expected in early October, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees in space from the southern plains to the northeast of the country.
In New York on Tuesday, air temperatures can rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises with a high probability of unusually high temperatures on the east coast of the United States until mid-October.
Senate hearings on Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s case have seen more than 20 million spectators
The testimony of Brett Cavano and Christina Blazey Ford, who accuses Cavano of attempting rape in the 1980s, on Thursday attracted the attention of more than 20 million viewers of six television channels.
The political confrontation surrounding Kavanaugh's candidacy received an unexpected continuation. On Friday, an urgent message was sent to the media: Republican Jeff Flake put forward a condition that the charges to the lawyer within one week of the FBI investigation.
As Ford said at hearings before the Senate Legal Committee, she was "100 percent sure" that Kavanaugh had attacked her drunk and tried to split her up at a school party.
Kavanaugh gave emotional testimony, stating that he was 100 percent sure that this was not the case.
According to the research agency Nielsen, Friday’s debates were viewed by more than 20.4 million viewers.
The agency took into account average statistics from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of audiences of other channels such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network are not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen’s rating does not always take into account viewers watching TV at work.
For comparison, it is about the average audience watching a game of American football in the playoffs or an Oscar-winning ceremony.
The biggest audience was on Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment: Senate hearings, which lasted all day, saw an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, Nielsen reports.
After the hearing, the interest in the case is not at all weakened.
On Friday, a real drama was played with Jeff Flake.
After the Arizona senator, who is considered a moderate Republican, reported his intention to support Kavanaugh's candidacy, CNN and CBS channels managed to record on the camera as an activist on Friday morning on the way to a meeting of the Legal Committee.
The whole world saw him, with his eyes closed, getting a bouquet from angry women on CNN live.
“I stand in front of you,” said one of them.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
“For you power, while so many women are powerless,” they tried to explain their position.
Flake replied to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would speak on the subject at a committee meeting. The elevator doors were closed, hiding the senator from all-around chambers.
When hours later the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the position of judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all TV channels broadcast the session live.
However, Flake made one condition - to conduct an FBI investigation on the charges against the candidate by the following week, as the democratic minority was seeking.
Flake claims he changed his mind thanks to the intervention of his friend, Democratic senator Chris Kuns.
He made the final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
Flake’s decision took effect, as it was obvious that Republicans were lacking enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
By President Trump’s decree, the FBI opened an investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “political games” around the Brexit situation
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow party interests above the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published on a single track with May’s interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called “Shashka” plan within the framework of the Brexit, saying she considers the introduction of customs duties between the UK and the EU “absolutely blind.”
Wade Sims's Death in Shooting: Police Arrested Dayton Simpson on Suspected Murder of Louisiana State University Forward
Police have arrested a man suspected of murdering Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the University of Louisiana.
According to Baton Rouge police, 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and detained on second-degree murder charges.
Police have released a video of the fight involving Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, the CBS regional channel, police found Simpson's DNA on the glasses found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he had fatally wounded Wade.
According to Advocate, Simpson has a deposit of <0x24>350,000.
The Colonel of the Eastern District of Baton Rouge on Friday issued a preliminary ruling: the death was caused by a cross-sectional combined fire wound to the neck and head.
The Division expresses its appreciation to the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Department, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local residents who assisted in carrying out the operative investigations that led to the detention.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the rule of law for their "goodwillful work to arrest a criminal."
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-meter forward was a native of Baton Rouge; his father Wayne also played in the Louisiana State University team.
Last season, Sims scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 picks on average for the match.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying the tragic death of Wade Sims caused a “shock” and “real grief” to all players.
“That’s what I’ve always feared,” the coach added.
The volcano covered Mexico with ash
The Popocatepetl Volcano slumped ash in the southern vicinity of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, Mexico’s National Center for Natural Disaster Prevention recommended that the population not approach the volcano: its crater had recorded activity and produced 183 gas emissions per day.
According to the Center's observations, near the volcano, thunderstorms often spread and drought was felt.
In some areas of Mexico, such as Sochimilko, social media users have published photos of car windshields covered with a thin layer of ash.
After an earthquake of 7.1 Mw, which shook central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded participating volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the capital.
Popocatepetl Volcano (or, for its own, Don Goyo) is an active volcano since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, a multi-thousand rally was held in Barcelona, dedicated to the first anniversary of the referendum on the exit of Catalonia from Spain, which divided the country into two camps. It did not take place without clashes between supporters of autonomy and police subordinates;
Police have pushed out protesters in favor of independence, while the latter, dressed in black masks, were detained with eggs and powder paint, raising a cloud of dark dust in the center of Barcelona.
After the police launched a barrage to deter the crowd, the riots resumed with new force.
For several hours, supporters of independence chanted: “We will not forget, we will not forgive!”, and their opponents responded with a slogan: “Long live Spain!”
According to the local press, fourteen participants of the campaign were hospitalized with minor injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain. It was recognized illegal by the Spanish government, but became an important milestone for the separatists. A year later, tensions persisted in the region's quest for sovereignty.
Catalonia voted overwhelmingly in favour of leaving Spain, but the turnout was low due to the fact that its opponents mostly boycotted the referendum.
According to official Catalan sources, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year in attempts by police to block the holding of a referendum in the country’s polling stations in violent clashes.
On Friday, separatists spent the night on the declared road following the demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration still took place, but it took another route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who attended a meeting of separatists in his wife’s company, sets out that the hope for Catalonia’s acquisition of sovereignty is becoming increasingly blurred.
“Last year was one of the most important events in our lives.
“My parents were crying out of happiness, having the opportunity to vote in a referendum, and today we are in a suspended state,” he said.
In the recent elections in December in the local governing bodies, the Catalan parties, who are in favor of the separation from Spain, have won an important victory, although with a small gap. However, this year their movement is losing their supporters' reputation, and it is a matter of fact that many of the well-known leaders of the movement are in the loop.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded a phone rally in support of the police, said the conflict was being warmed by both sides of the political spectrum.
“Tension is rising,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junckeras, one of the nine leaders of Catalan separatists, who have been in the preliminary detention chamber since the end of last year, announced his intention to join the European Parliament next year.
“Participating in the next elections to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Car crashed into house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the homes in Londonbury was hit by a car several times; men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested.
The attack was carried out on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. local time in the Ballinagard Crest area.
As a result, the gate and the building were damaged, criminal police inspector Bob Blemmings said.
There are reports that the car could have been shot from the bow.
Livingston win over Rangers thanks to goal goal Mengha
Dolly Menghi's first goal brought a guaranteed victory to the Liverpool team
Thanks to the beaten ball, Livingstone won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the head coach of the Scottish club, Steven Gerrard, this is only the second defeat in 18 games.
The exact strike of Dolly Menghi matched the team of Gary Holt with the Hibernian club in the scoreboard, where they shared second place.
Gerrard's club has been unsuccessful in the Premier League this season. They are scheduled to meet with the group's leaders on Sunday, the Harts, of whom the Rangers are eight points behind.
On Thursday, the Rangers will play a European League match on their field with the Austrian club Rapid (Vienna).
Livingston Club continues its unbeaten series in the division, having played six matches and received no losses since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's head coach.
Missing moments for Livingston in a fight with hardy guests
Holt’s under-care coaches had to account from the very beginning – the “rangers” clearly did not cope with their efforts.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the goal from his weak attempt failed. Then defender Alan Litgow, crawling too wide, was unable to prevent the ball from falling into the net by Keith Halkett.
The host party allowed the Rangers to play in front of their line of defense, counting on dangerous moments when the game was resumed.
That’s how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers gave up the free kick, and Livingstone took advantage of the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made the transfer of Menge, who shot from the central position.
By that time, the Rangers had a superior possession of the ball, but the protection of the host team was unbreakable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried.
The second time went on according to the same scheme, although Kelly still had to knock off the strike from Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked the ball off Scott Pittman with his leg, and Litgou made a wide draw from the standard position.
The balls were constantly falling into the Liverpool penalty, but all the attacks were reflected, and the two penalty claims — one for provoking substitute Glenn Middleton Halkett and the other for hand-playing — were not met.
The "phenomenal" game "Livingstone" - analysis
From BBC Scotland — Alasder Lamont, "Tony Macaroni Arena"
A phenomenal game and a great result for the Liverpool team.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their ascent to the soccer Olympics.
Their style of play and composition have barely changed since they climbed to the top of the rankings, and the great merit of Holt's coach is that he mobilized this team from the very beginning.
There were a lot of real heroes in his team.
Captain Halkett led a superbly organized defense, and Meng did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Warall to relax.
At the same time, the Rangers couldn’t get into the rhythm.
“Although they had good game moments with coach Gerrard, this time they did not meet our expectations.
In the last few minutes of the game, they missed the possession of the ball, and they managed to pass the defending team only once. The Rangers, who had come down in the middle of the table, had something to think about.
Cold reception of Erdogan during his visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, there was a great weather, and the two seniors were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO member countries – a visit, and already associated with some conflicts.
The heads of state failed to find an understanding on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to attend the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a 25,000-strong crowd to enter the mosque, but many of Erdogan’s supporters were in the vicinity to see their president.
At the same place, opponents of the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, gathered to condemn both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to visit Germany.
The presence of radically opposite views at the meeting reflects the ambiguous essence of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots carry Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptford Road Accident: Car collision led to the death of a cyclist
In London, a car collided with a cyclist who died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred near Beestud Street and Evelyn Street, a bustling intersection in the southeastern part of Depfort, around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the sanitators who came to the place tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without coming to mind.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just a mile and a half from the scene of the accident, on Childers Street, another cyclist was knocked down by a car whose driver was hiding.
The London police report that work is currently underway to identify the deceased and inform his closest relatives.
While at the scene of the accident, roads are blocked and the bus route has been changed: drivers are asked not to enter the area.
Unrest in Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers wounded
According to the Long Lartin administration, six police officers were injured in the riots committed in a men ' s strict prison.
In the men’s prison of the strict Long Lartin regime (Wustershire) since Sunday, unrest has continued, which has ignited around 09:30 local time.
To suppress the unrest involving eight prisoners from one wing, the opera group Tornado was summoned.
The police suffered minor damage to the soft tissues of the face; they received medical care on the spot.
According to the prison official, “specially trained staff were recruited to resolve the incident at the Long Lartin correctional facility.
Six of them were injured.
“We are categorically denying the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their restraints may be changed for a longer period of time.”
Long Lartin currently holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, a report appeared in the media that the prison administrator was hospitalized after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, the prison leadership was forced to attract special-purpose units to soothe the exploding prisoners who threw billiard balls into the guards.
Hurricane Rosa may flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit droughty territories)
Arizona rarely falls into the area of the passage of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time it was “lucky”: at the beginning of next week, Hurricane Rose, having made the last whirlwind, must pass over the desert part of the Southwest and bring with it the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already warned of the threat of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, in southeastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, and Sotchi.
Hurricane Rose is expected to pass on a straight line above Phoenix on Tuesday and flow through rainfall on Monday evening.
The Bureau of the National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have retained the status of a tropical storm or depression within a radius of 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the border of Arizona.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Meteorological Service, it will drop from 5 to 10 cm of rainfall, reaching 15 cm on the Arizona plateau of Mogollon-Rome.
In other desert regions of the Southwest, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Pool, it is possible to drop up to 2.5-5 cm of rainfall, with precipitation sites can reach 10 cm.
For the areas where rainfall flows will pass away, the rain brought by Hurricane Rose can be a real blessing, as the region has long suffered from drought.
Although rainfall floods may pose a danger, abundant rains can ease a drought season that is not taking place in the Southwest of the United States.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor maps, at least 40% of Arizona’s territory is affected by severe drought (the second most severe category),” the weather.com website said.
Hurricane Rose will first strike in the Mexican state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, whose maximum speed is 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane was in a cooler water zone on the Pacific coast and is thus losing its strength.
In the second half of the day, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of "tropical storm".
It is expected that in some areas of Mexico there will be abundant flooding with the threat of flooding.
“In the territory of Lower California to northwest Sonora can fall up to 7-10 cm of rainfall, places up to 25 cm,” reports the weather.com website.
Next, Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexico and arrive early in the morning on Tuesday at the border with Arizona in the category of tropical cyclone. From Arizona it will reach the southern part of Utah by Tuesday evening.
"The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rose and its remains is associated with heavy rains in Lower California, the northwestern part of Sonora and the desert areas of the southwestern United States," the National Meteorological Service said in a statement.
Rainfall is expected to cause dangerous rainstorms, muddy flows in the desert and possible slips in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four suspects arrested in assassination attempt
In Somerset, a 16-year-old teenager suffered severe knife injuries. Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
Victims of the attack with severe injuries were found in the area of the Exelsior Terrace in the city of Midsomer Norton at about 4 a.m. on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as "stable".
The same evening, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset districts.
Police are looking for possible witnesses of the crime, who have any video footage of what happened on a mobile phone.
Donald Trump: “All the hatred, all the rage” of the Democrats broke up in Kavanaugh”
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics adopted by Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, in the process of affirming Kavanaugh’s nomination for the candidate, “all hatred, all evil” of the Democratic Party has been disrupted.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in the U.S. Congress, in his emotional address categorically rejecting the accusation of Christina Blazey Ford that he sexually harassed her more than 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during the hearing on her allegations.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that on that day “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for the approval of Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for the approval of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an unprecedented public service list,” the president announced to a crowd of his colleagues in West Virginia.
In his speech, the president indirectly addressed the question of the nomination of Kavanaugh, referring to the importance of the Republicans in the elections to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“The most important elections in our life are only five weeks left.
I don’t take part in them, but I take part in the race in a different way,” he said.
"I'm acting like a burner and I'm fighting for our great candidates."
Trump believes that the Democrats have set themselves the task of “resisting us with all their strength.”
According to the regulation, the first key vote in the Senate to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy should be held no later than Friday, a deputy senior representative of the Republican Party said.
Earthquake in Indonesia has killed hundreds of people, and total death toll continues to rise
On Saturday, Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were killed by giant waves that seized the beaches of Indonesia’s island of Sulawesi, which was hit by an incredible force by tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims were hundreds of guests of the beach festival in the city of Palu. On Friday on the western coast reached waves of almost six meters high, which dared everything on their way and led to the immediate death of many of the attendees.
Tsunamis followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach vacation, instead of immediately fleeing to hiding, and as a result, they lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Indonesian National Police Administration.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, there were cars in the stream, the swamps, the whole house, the nature destroyed everything along its way,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and hit the coast with all the force.
Some of the people in attendance went to the trees, which saved their lives.
Approximately 16,700 locals were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
On the aerial footage of the disaster management, you can see the destroyed houses, shops, collapsed bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaking underground thrusts.
A series of earthquakes occurred in a territory with a population of 2.4 million people.
A statement by the Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) stated that the earthquake-induced energy emissions were about 200 times higher than the explosion of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected due to the geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage "scaling", adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, bodies of the deceased were found; a total of 540 people were injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho added that the casualties and destruction could be even more significant along the coast to 300 km from Palu, at the site of Dongal, which was closest to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communications with Dungal were “completely destroyed, no information was received.”
"There are more than 300,000 people living in the Dongal area," the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement, whose staff and volunteers have already moved to the disaster zone.
“There has been a tragedy, but it is not yet a limit,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized as it did not report the tsunami in Palu in time. However, the authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at the time when the initial warning was still in force.
On social media, an amateur video appeared, in which a man on the upper floor of the building screams about a tsunami, desperately trying to attract the attention of people on the street.
A few minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the shore, bringing with it entire houses and cars.
Reuters has yet to confirm the authorship of the film.
Earthquakes and tsunamis led to a large congestion of electrolytes, which resulted in the loss of communication in Palu, which made life-saving services very difficult.
Military transport aircraft with humanitarian assistance were dispatched from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated population still lacks food and essential items, government sources say.
The city's airport was only open for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights by October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
Volunteers of the World Vision charity safely arrived from Dungala in Palu, where the staff found shelter in the brass tents broken in the courtyard of their office building. According to the Sinai Presbytery, their eyes were on the way to a terrible picture of complete destruction.
“They’ve seen a huge number of destroyed houses,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charitable organizations have begun to implement humanitarian aid mechanisms, but many complain that professionals from international NGOs have failed to reach Palu.
Indonesian legislation allows the recruitment of funding, humanitarian aid and staff of foreign organizations only after the announcement of the place where the nature of the national disaster zone has hit.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed to be a local disaster,” said Aulia Ariani, a press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares a natural disaster to be national, we will be able to accept foreign assistance, but so far the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Palu, friends and relatives of people who are missing still hope for their miraculous salvation, which will restore the people’s faith in the best.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued, who fell into the sewer aisle.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman out of the building, who spent two days there, next to her mother’s breathless body.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesian national paragliding coach, has trained two of the missing unleashed pilots for the recent Indonesian Asian Games.
Among the other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandaga.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and emotionally it’s hard to survive,” he said.
Gendon recalls how, after learning of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel from other paragliders, over the next few hours he was desperately trying to contact his pal pals resting at the beach festival on WhatsApp.
However, his messages were displayed with one grey spot, not two blue ones.
“This means that the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Theft of <0x24>26,750 during ATM service in Newport-on-Live
On Friday morning, the attackers kidnapped <0x24>26,750 from Brink's cashier, which runs one of the ATMs in the city of Newport-on-Live, according to a Newport police press release.
According to investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored microbus took cash from the ATM located in the entertainment complex, and was going to load it with new banknotes.
During this time, “a Brink’s employee ran from behind the attacker” and stole a bag of banknotes to fill the ATM.
According to witnesses to the incident, several suspects fled the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens who have any information about these persons are asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper has changed his name to him
Rapper Canyon West invented a new name: Her.
On Saturday, he tweeted: “A personality formerly known as Canyon West.”
The 41-year-old West has long been using this pseudonym and even put it in the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
News of this appeared in the eve of Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new album Yandhi.
Kanye West will be acting as the lead singer in place of Arianna, who cancelled her participation due to "emotional experiences," the author of the show said.
West had previously stated that the pseudonym is not only a shortened version of his name, but also has a religious meaning.
"Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means 'you', 'you'," West explained the title of his album in one of the recent interviews with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“It’s me, it’s you, it’s me.
At first there was Kanye, which means “one,” and now I am only him, that is, the reflection of all the good, the bad, the incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.”
Kanye was not the first known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Daddy, Pi Diddy, or simply Diddy, this year asked to call himself Lev (“Love”) or Braza Lev (“Brother Love” or “Brother Love”).
Speaking with West, rapper Jay-Z also changed the spelling of his name several times: with and without deficiency, spelling letters or syllables.
President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has sworn never to resort to military force against civilians on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a student demonstration that ended in a bloody clash.
Speaking on Tlatelolco Square on Saturday, President Lopez Obrador promised "never to resort to the help of the army to suppress the Mexican people."
On 2 October 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired in the crowd and the carnage began, killing 300 people. This took place against the backdrop of the strengthening of the left student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador also promised to support Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and to open more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of prospects for study lead young people directly into a criminal world.
U.S. dollars need to double the financing of AI developments
China and its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts should not be underestimated – the U.S. should double its investment in its scientific development, says Lee Kaif, an investor and AI development entrepreneur with experience working at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Previously, statements about AI were made by several U.S. ministries, although overall the U.S. does not have a clear strategy in the field of AI development.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
“Increasing the budget for AI research twice would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S., and we expect the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
Increasing funding twice could double the chances that the next major AI achievement will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the world’s leading companies.
In the 1980s at Carnegie-Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the tallest player in the U.S. Otello, and then he was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology contests, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects’ Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next contest would take place to help find people with unconventional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It’s not China that absorbs academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring lights from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. develop artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of artificial intelligence of the next generation.
China’s National Natural Sciences Fund is providing funding to scientists similar to how the National Science Fund and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Lee says.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which industry and scientific partners are expected to participate, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of <0x24>2 billion in a program called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which has sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has been taking no action in this regard for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would allow to resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for accession to the European Union.
Greece, which is part of the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim on its territory, and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments concluded an agreement based on the proposal for a new name, but opposition nationalists claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the voter turnout would meet the 50 percent minimum required for the referendum.
The question raised in the referendum was as follows: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU on the condition that a treaty with Greece is adopted?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the dissolution of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievskaya, a resident of Skop.
A sufficient number of MEPs said they would adhere to the results of the vote to make it decisive, even if it does not have mandatory legal force.
A change of name will require a majority of two-thirds of the members of parliament.
The State Election Commission said that no reports of violations were received by 13:00.
However, it was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says Jose Tanevski, a 62-year-old elector from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on the country's name change, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumitz, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, laying chairs in front of the tents set up by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are for membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with a high head, not bypassing the thresholds of the offices,” Kavadarkov said.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring investments to Macedonia, which is so necessary for this country, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that the positive response will be “the guarantee of our prosperous future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, but this is below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV channel found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of the respondents said they voted in favour.
For a referendum to take place, the referendum must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City skips Brighton defense to score goal
Sergio Aguiaro and Rahim Sterling fought to defend Brighton, leading Manchester City to a 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute, it didn’t seem like he had any trouble.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a pass in the center of the field.
He flew between the three defenders of the Brighton before plunging into open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green t-shirts.
He surrounds one defender and surrounds several others on the edge of the Brighton Penalty Zone.
He then handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English striker, in the penalty area, in one touch returned the Aguaro ball, which with his right leg pierced Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan in the right corner of the goal.
"Aguero is having some leg problems," Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blue an initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game Aguero got the ball, being deep in the territory of Brighton
He gave an excellent left flank crossover to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a few touchdowns before handing over to Sterling on a long-distance stand.
The attacker of the Sky Blue hit the ball in the gate just before flying out of the field.
Manchester City faced Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer to pick up his glasses at Colorado Rockies
After the Washington Nationals got out of the battle for the playoffs, there was no special reason to force the events.
But tireless Sherzer hopes to take the lead in the fight against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division, start problems in the playoffs.
With a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Roxies have already won at least 7 or 8 places, but they still hope to secure a title in the first division.
“While we’re just playing this way, at least we can keep our positions, knowing the enormous importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of the spectators and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss that?”
"Nationals" have not yet announced the singer on Sunday, but, according to the latest data, in the current situation, tend to expose Sherzer to this role.
Sherzer, who is going to go for the 34th game, threw the ball on the pitcher's pitch on Thursday, and on Sunday, on his weekend, will be a pitcher.
Statistics of right-winger Washington — 18-7 with an ERA rating of 2.53 and 300 cars in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds an election race in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of the Republicans in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, the nomination submitted by the president to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we did was put on the map in November.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s very, very important. I don’t run, although I really run, fighting for good candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, and we are witnessing atrocities and atrocities.
They don’t care who they insult, through whom they have to go to get power and control, that’s what they want to get – power and control, but we’re not going to give them to them.”
Democrats, he says, set the goal of “opposing and obstructing.”
“And you’ve been watching this for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “bad, cowardly, cowardly and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee, referring to Senator Democrat Dylan Finnstein, which caused loud voices from the chamber.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the contents of this document to leak?
Um... um... what document?
No, no. The body language has issued it, I have never seen the body language disprove words so much.”
The Labour Party is no longer an organization that holds different views.
It does not tolerate those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party put forward a motion for a vote of no confidence in me, it was no surprise.
In the end, I am the last of a number of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party, who have not yet been expressed that we are not welcomed by the fact that we are expressing our opinion.
I have a similar attitude to my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, are issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a notice to the Nottingham Eastern Labour Assembly on Friday, it was stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the time from my eight years in office as a local MP from the Labour Party, the evening meetings of the GC were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today’s tone does not correspond to so many meetings, and the promise of a “more human and soft” policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever been.
The fact that differences of opinion are not allowed in the Labour Party is becoming more and more evident, and each opinion is assessed on the subject of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political perspective I had previously considered similar to my own began to expect that I would radically change my views and borrow a position that I would never agree with.
Every time after my public address – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there is a tyranny of insults on social media calling for the cancellation of elections condemning the policy of the centre, or claiming that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just happening to me.
Indeed, I know that I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments on my behalf still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a stream of sexual or racist attacks every day, but never give up.
The most disappointing thing in this policy is that such a number of insults have become considered the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that “broad church,” and with every vote of distrust or change in the rules of the party’s choice it becomes already.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of recommendations that encourage me to sit quietly and speak quietly, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour 32 years ago, being a student of a school, outraged by the negligent attitude of the Tatcher government, which has literally caused my school class to collapse, I have been a hard worker, or a hard worker, to defend the highest standard of public services for all those who are more.
I never concealed my political views, nor did I conceal my political views in the past elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have misinterpreted my political positions and spheres in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say the following: our country is moving so hard towards a Brexit that will certainly cause economic, industrial and state damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and strength on my loyalty.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, no matter whether they are workers or not: I am proud of what I serve you, and I promise that I will not consider your interest as a threat to the outcome of the elections, or a political goal.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament from Nottingham East District
ER 38-17 Melrose: The Invincible ER comes first
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but without a doubt, Er deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Premier League match of Tennant.
Now they lead the table, the only invincible team of dozens.
After all, all thanks to their excellent protection, as well as the ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merchi the full right to be satisfied.
“All this time we have been tested for strength and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” said Peter Mercy.
Robin Christie, Melrose: “It’s worth paying tribute to Ear, they’ve tried better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fresher Clima pushed Ear forward, but the yellow card issued for the game "Voriors" to Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed "Melrows" to go forward, and Jason Baggot did not.
Klimo increased the break of "Er" from the penalty, before, right in the middle of the game, earning a point, and then in the break realised a single attempt, making a count of 17-5 in favor of "Er".
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Baggot reduced the gap to five points.
There was then a long break due to the severe injury of Ruard Knott, who had been tense, and after the re-release, "Ear" proceeded further thanks to Stafford Mcdawell's attempt by Climate.
Acting captain Blair McFerson was then given a yellow card, and again Melrose forced his opponents to pay another player for Bruce Colvin’s unrealized attempt at the end of the period of fierce pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hatchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Clima without a ball from the penalty line, McFerson made a tachdown behind the offensive mall "Ear".
Clima realized the advantage, not stopping almost from the re-release itself, after Kyle Row received a blow from David Armstrong and sent the ultimate attacker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the field owners.
Star Still Game is set to start a new career in restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiran is about to start work in the hotel industry: it has become known that he was appointed the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, the script he is writing for, and is filming with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The Duet announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the show, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craigland.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on this information, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kirnan plans to participate in a “proliferating restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“Our Sea”: Bolivia’s lack of access to the sea hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patroll the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined up with the slogan: “Our seas are right.
It is our duty to return it.”
Throughout Bolivia, which has no seafront, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile as a result of the bloodthirsty 19th century conflict over resources is still alive; living and striving to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes have perhaps become the boldest in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the international court, which will take place on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and a mental balance and, of course, there is a positive outcome here,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadilla.
Many Bolivians will observe the process of ruling in the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will be able to support Bolivia’s statement that after decades of tense negotiations Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign sovereignty over Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is leading a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also excited about the decision to be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if so, it will little change.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to control Chilean territory and has already stated that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling was delivered only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case was “not complicated,” says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
For the past four years, the case of Bolivia has not progressed, but has been postponed all the time.
“The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” says Zarate.
According to her, the military rhetoric of Morales destroyed the last Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagrees that the court’s decision was taken too quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an “exclusive opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, is using the naval problem as a political affair.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to make sure once again that we have to move through our past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Will Not Exist Until It Can Trust The US
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ree Yong-ho, said his country would never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ry spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of its countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of resumption of halting nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ree claims that the dream that long-term sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever put the North on its knees is a utopia.
Washington is afraid of endorsing this declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant steps to disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows will showcase the latest line of massive headwear that promise to appear in mass sales, and they will be worn right next to you
If you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, there is no need to look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a mass of unusual headdresses that are part of their SS19 collection and the blind visitors of the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, extremely impractical hats gained popularity among Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their snooze creations to the podium.
A distinguished Valentino specimen: the head beige furnishing, decorated with wide fields, similar to feathers, was painted on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included jewelry decorated with gemstones, a wizard’s hat and even pineapple, but all these headsets are not designed to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of strange masks, which had to be very much on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these pear masks had their mouths stitched, and they resembled more a portrait of Hannibal Lector than a sculpture.
One of the specimens resembled the equipment for diving with a tube and protective glasses, and the other — the melting ice cream.
If you are a fan of high fashion, you are lucky.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have all the chances of breaking into mass sales – right at you.
Huge-sized hats go along the “La Bomba” feathers, a straw hat with two-foot wide fields, which were already worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratakovsky.
The cult label, which released this extremely impractical hat, which gained such widespread popularity in social media, gave birth and sent to walk on the podium another huge accessory - not a model bag of straw, a suitcase almost as large as a suitcase.
The orange raffia bag with a white leather handle and a raffia embroidery became a bright specimen of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: "I think big hats and beach bags will appear in mass sales next summer. Since the designer has produced such furor with his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the acoustic demand."
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland continue the tradition of brilliant education, which was once again confirmed in 2018: the outstanding results of the exams demonstrated individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other socially significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are trained throughout Scotland, and aim to provide the highest level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further higher education, the careers they choose, as well as for the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, you are calling to his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, you turn to his heart.”
It is a convincing proof that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to build relationships with the citizens of other countries and be able to trust them.
Based on the results of this year’s latest exams, we see that languages occupy the leading positions in league tables and have the highest score on exam results in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of the students who studied foreign languages received a higher A rating.
Data from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received an “A” in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German learners, 69 per cent of French learners and 63 per cent of Spanish learners also received an “A”.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are undoubtedly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Currently, language subjects are in the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that among the reasons that made employers difficult to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what profession the student will choose if he learns a second language, in the future he will gain a real advantage by mastering another additional skill that will benefit him throughout his further life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, while French was the only language with a two-digit percentage – 15 percent of English speakers speak it.
That’s why investing in language education is so important now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children more chances of finding a good job.
In schools in Scotland, there is a fairly large spread in terms of the languages taught — each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in light of the future development of the country by 2020 – such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, in independent schools there will always be a choice of several languages with a teaching staff whose members are specialists in these languages.
Scottish independent schools seek to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future awaits them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, languages are still vital for the future development of the country, so that should be reflected in education accordingly.
In fact, modern languages really need to be seen as “skills of international communication.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits for the young people of Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edwards, Director of the Board of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron makes his debut as the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Fans’ longing to see LeBron James perform for the first time in the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a pre-season Sunday match against the Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But he still has to figure out how much time he has to play.
"More than one and less than forty-eight," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for relatively six pre-season games on the Lakers charts.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” he said.
The Trump Pre-election Race in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of pre-election meetings tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is Trump’s first of five scheduled meetings next week, including a friendly visit to Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on the nomination he proposed for the position of supreme judge has been postponed, Trump seeks to gain support in the upcoming interim elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote takes place.
What time is the Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wiling, West Virginia, will take place at 19:00 Eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting with West Virginia voters online live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at the hearings that will take place this week, on the subject of the appointment of his candidate Brett Kavanaugh as supreme judge. The Trump proposal of this nomination has caused a mass of negative responses, as Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual harassment and sexual harassment.
But the main goal of this action is to help Republicans, who are going to the November elections, increase their pre-election pace.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign aims to ensure that these five meetings, which are due to take place next week, help “activate the activities of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important to his agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible, because we are entering the tense campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman said in a statement.
The action planned today at the Wesbanco Arena in Wiling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media,” West Virginia Metro News reported.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia this Saturday is the second visit to the state in the last month, as this is where he gained an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisi, who is delayed as a result of polls.
“The fact that Morrissey has to get ahead of competitors in polls is a bad sign for Morrissey himself,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Raider Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates readiness to fight and feeds hopes by going to pairs on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday's two-to-two game may have been exactly what Ryder's Cup needed.
A transitional initiative is an exceptionally invented sports concept, but it is what players believe, and in such competitions it is especially pronounced.
So who has the initiative?
“They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I think it’s a small initiative for us,” said Jordan Spit.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points, and another twelve on the cone.
Americans, according to Spice, feel “the wind in the sails,” and they have reasons to keep the spirit up, not least thanks to Spice and Justin Thomas’ form playing together all day, and each can boast of three out of four points.
Sleep was unshakable from you to the grin, which gave a personal example.
Winning announcements became louder as his round continued, squeezing the decisive ball into the moon, closing the match when they and Thomas surrendered two by two.
His strike, which gave them a win in the game on the 15th, was met with a similar rumor, one of those who spoke of his belief in a chance for the American team.
“We need to get together with all our strength and focus only on our game,” Spit commented.
That’s all that’s left for the players.
Go through 18 rounds and become the winners.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flytwood, who have undoubtedly entered the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe kicked out four out of four, and they don’t seem to know the mistakes.
"Mollywood" were the only couple who did not pick up the Boggies on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the Boggies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning.
Such a series, and how their energy seems to circulate between them and unreal fans, strengthens the belief that even on Sunday they will not be defeated, and when the sun hides behind the horizon of the Le Golf National, there will be no more famous player who is holding the Moody's.
It would be great if both of them were on different moons at the same time.
However, to talk about the glory of Europe so far is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly broke up with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game, when he was in a pair with Alex Noren.
The Boggi and two double Boggi on the first nine moons dug a Spanish and Swedish well from which they were never able to get out.
So on Sunday no one will help you get out of your pit.
It’s so exciting to watch the game in four balls and four players because of the interactions between the pairs, the tips that they exchange and that deliberately silence, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
So far, Europe has played better as a team, and has moved forward considerably on the last day, but this Thursday session has also shown that the U.S. team has all the strength to fight in which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup Europe leads with a score of 10-6
Europe will gain a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after completing the Saturday matches in four balls and a Thursday with an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Flytwood and Francesco Molinari led a fight with two victories over the wrestling Tiger Woods to bring the record to four points at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, wishing to regain his lost trophy in Hazelstein two years ago, dominated the American team's mistake in four games in the morning, winning 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the quarters, winning two matches, but they were unable to reduce the gap in the score.
Jim Ferrick's team needs eight points out of 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Flittwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, while he and Mollynari, who got the nickname "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points in the first four games in the history of the Cup.
Breaking down Woods and Patrick Reed into four balls, they then merged magnificently to win over the fallen Woods and American newcomer Bryson Decebmo with an even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who played two Saturday matches, showed periodic flashes, but now he lost 19 of 29 games in four balls and four – seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested before the morning game in four balls, returned to partner Henry Stanson in the quarter by defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepku with a 2/1 score, occupying first and third place in the world.
For Europe, the game has not been an easy and pleasant walk to the southwest of Paris.
The three-time champions Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas earned two points on Saturday for the Americans.
They scored a decisive 2/1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Polter in the game in four balls and returned later to beat Polter and Rory MacKilroy with 4/3 in the quarters, losing the first two pounds.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team got out of the delay by four points, going out alone, considering that Ferrick's team as hosts had to play a decisive game to hold the trophy.
However, after two days of retaining second place, the Sunday counterattack looks as if it is beyond their capability.
North Korea says it will not “categorically” disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said at the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are intensifying distrust of the United States and that its country will under no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ree Yong-ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial goodwill measures” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear propulsion and the commitment not to increase non-nuclear stockpiles and disarmament.
“However, we do not observe a symmetrical reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not be able to unilaterally take disarmament action first.”
While Ree repeated the already heard North Korean complaints against Washington's resistance to a "stage" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement was a skeptic in the sense that it did not reject the one.
Ree referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the current president of the United States and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on June 12; then Kim assured the security of the security, promising to start the movement towards the "denuclearization".
North Korea is seeking to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to weaken harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists that ‘denuclearization must first be carried out’ and increases the pressure through sanctions in order to coercive their goal and even object to ‘announcement of the end of the war’,” he said.
“The notion that sanctions can put us on our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions are intensifying our distrust.”
Ree did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea, not the United States, had been part of this issue of denuclearization.”
However, the tone of Ree’s speech differed sharply from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s targeting of missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after Trump called Kim a “suicide rocket.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who threatened last year to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there is still much to be done, and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set any temporary deadlines for the process: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s introduction of sanctions should continue actively and mandatoryly until we see a full, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, seeking to shut down the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ry in the corners of the UN General Assembly summit and announced after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea condemned him for “bandit demands.”
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States, on its part, takes “appropriate measures.”
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was talking about were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest in special courses
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, helped all elementary school students learn more to sleep and fight against the chauvinist culture of uninterrupted caffeine consumption in order to wake up to the “nights of spring.”
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chassler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After his discovery, he was inspired by the idea of introducing such a course, in advance of a report on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl approached me and said, ‘It’s a pity that I learned about it only now that I’m almost finished.’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered to students this year, talks about how a healthy sleep habit contributes to academic and sports performance, as well as how it improves a person’s overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s Health Service, says the university decided to introduce this course after it was discovered that students experienced a serious lack of sleep during the course.
The class lasts one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
In one section of the class, an image of the room in the dormitory is offered, where students, by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, exercisers and books, get information about how each of these actions and substances — the daily amount of coffee, the light, which cause sleep deficiency — affect the outcome.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
The interactive campus map encourages the participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students at once.
But we believe that they have the right to know, like any other person has the right to know about, for example, how smoking affects his health,” added Professor Chasler.
According to him, the false sense of pride that a person can “sleep all night” is still widespread, and modern technologies, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
According to him, a sufficient amount of good quality sleep is a student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to fight overweight, as insomnia turns the brain into hunger.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasler develop a course by attending one of the classes last year during his first year of study at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information across the campus.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduates to go through a similar curriculum before entering a competitive educational institution.
Professor Chasler advises students to set up a alarm clock warning that they need to lie down and wake up, as well as remember the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, which disrupts the human biorhythm and leads to problems.
Liverpool 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga brings victory over Gerrard's team
The Rangers went through another sad departure as Dolly Meng's goal led the uncollected team of Stephen Gerrard to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox team hoped to get their first win at the exit after a 4:1 win in February in St. John's, but the Gary Holt team only made a second defeat to Gerrard in 18 games. Prebayland's team as a manager, leaving his team "easy" by eight points.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lost the power of the spirit, did not appear to be going to level the score.
While the Rangers are now down in sixth place, Livingston is up in third place, and only Hibernian is down in terms of the scoring.
And the Rangers may have additional problems after linear judge Calum Spence had to heal a wound on his head after an item was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the team that passed through the Ears in the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
In turn, Holt went with the same Levy 11 strategy, thanks to which he increased the gap with the Harts last week, and he would be happy to see how his well-forced team tightened up opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have led in the possession of a sword, but the Livingstone pushed far more when the ball fell to them.
They had to score in just two minutes when the first Meng's transfer to Scott Pittman was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the defender took advantage of the opportunity.
Kigan Jacobs scored a penalty kick on team captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgou, only managed to send the ball to the far side.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third there seemed to be more hope than the belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was confident that he was to hit a penalty kick for the 45th minute when he and Steven Lowelles collided, but Judge Steven Thompson did not agree with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers made only two strikes in the first tie, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was barely worried by Lassana Kulibali's head and a weak strike by Ovi Ejaria.
Although Levy’s first goal, scored in the 34th minute, may not have matched the game, no one can deny that they deserved it solely by their own effort.
But again, "Rangers" failed to cope with Jacobs' game from the standard position.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to pass the ball to Meng to finish.
Gerrard began acting on a break when he replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately resulted when the extreme half-defense gave the pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly leaned away from his interception line.
But Livingstone continued to drag guests into the game they planned with Litgou and Halkett, constantly making long-distance broadcasts.
Holt's team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before giving Lithgow a field-angle transfer.
Rangers' substitute, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a penalty kick after he collided with Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.
Almanah: The Inventor of Geiger's Counter
And now the page of our almanac "Easter Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day in Germany was born the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that ultimately led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Becoming one of the foundations of science, Geiger's counter has also become one of the foundations of popular culture, and this is reflected in the 1950s film "The Clock of the Coronado", with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans - such - seemingly not in the minds of the scholars:
Man: "What kind of stuff is that?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
“When you wear these headphones, you can really hear the influence of atoms generated by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “That’s exactly what I hear now!”
Ganesh Geiger died in 1945, not having lived a few days before his 63th birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Abnormal Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormally growing cells and kill them
Part of the curative action of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions.
As a result of this change, cells get the ability to “see” the type of protein typical of many cancers, then cells need to be carried back.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one patient who was given this vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize abnormal cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and change them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can “see” the HER2 protein typical for many cancers, then the modified cells are re-introduced to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski, the U.S. National Cancer Research Institute, Wife, Maryland, says: “The results we have obtained suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 "stimulates the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.
A similar method was successfully applied in the treatment of leukemia. It was to block immune cells in patients and "learn" them how to affect cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in the MAGA hat after his appearance in the SNL.
Everything went wrong.
Canyon West was featured in the studio during a Saturday concert in which he spoke in defense of U.S. President Donald Trump, claiming he will retake the position in 2020.
After performing his third song called "The Ghost City", which he wore the cap "Let's Make America Great Again", the performer made a speech against the Democrats and supported Trump.
“Very often I talk to white people, and they ask me, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL made a parody show with Matt Damon in the lead role, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavano's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on claims of sexual harassment by Christina Blaise Ford.
They did not show how the crowd was upset by West’s statement, but this video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to make West laugh at this step.
In addition, West complained to the public that his hat was laughed behind the scenes.
“They were hugging me behind the scenes.
They say don't go out in this hat.
They were really clinging to me!
The Washington Examiner quoted him as saying, “And they even said that my position was not cool.”
West continues: “And do you want to know what’s not cool? Put on a superman coat so that no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue to evolve?
Then you need love.”
His comments, at least twice, attracted the attention of the audience, members of the SNL cast seemed lost, and one person told the publisher: “The whole studio was immersed in silence.”
West was invited at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariane Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
Many were confused by West's performance of the song "I Love It" in Perrier's bottle costume.
West received the support of TPUSA leader Candy Turner, who tweeted: “One of the bravest people: SPASIBLE FOR THE SUPPORT OF MANY.”
Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply “who he is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I don’t want to support anyone (by buying his music, clothing or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my opinion, shares and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he is now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puffy, Puffy and Pi Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snup Dog, originally had the name Snup Lyon, and as another example, of course, you can bring the performer, who recently became a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to the symbol, and then to the name of the artist, formerly known as "Prince" (Prince).
Attempted murder in Belfast's Female Female Restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died from knife injuries in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhakamor, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington is attacking toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as John Snow’s swinging sword in HBO’s brutal medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor recently hotly criticized the male-hero stereotype, saying that such characters often induce young people to think that in order to be respected, you have to be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed “something went wrong” and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his colleague in the movie Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, his peer, admitted that he was “very indifferent” to the problem.
“Personally, I take this question quite seriously: where did we go wrong with the perception of courage?” the actor asks.
“What do we teach teens that we have such a problem today?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for this spike of toxic masculinity due to too muscular characters.
The actor continues: “What is innate and what is acquired?
Why are they being taught on TV and on the streets, making young men feel that they should show only one particular aspect of courage?
I think this is really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change it?
Because today with young people, there’s really something wrong with it.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the "Game of Thrones" series after the series ends next summer, saying he had "ending with battalions and horses".
From November, Keith will play a leading role in the re-releasing "True West" of Sam Shepard, telling about the film's producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believes meeting his wife, Rose, is the best final of the Game of Thrones for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my next life,” he said.
Rose played The Player – the subject of the passion of the character of Kit John Snow in the fantasy series, awarded the Emmy Award.
The couple celebrated their wedding in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 percent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country suffer from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
In the vast majority of new cases of the disease were sexually transmitted, which indicates a change in trends in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infections has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 each year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Studies confirm that because of the country’s conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to the insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies information about the leak of Republican senators’ guilt, complaining of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory”
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees posted personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
A Los Angeles Democrat claims that the claims were counterfeited by “ultraright” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more subtle lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators. Lindsey Graham, Southern California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hetch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during hearings at the Senate commission on charges of sexual harassment filed against the candidate in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was linked to the Waters office, and released information about the Waters employees, Hill reports.
“This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false,” said Waters.
“A member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these frauds, was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unsubstantiated statement is a complete lie.”
The Waters statement immediately sparked criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Flescher.
“It’s an outrageous denial,” Flimmer writes.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for working in Congress.
When you're being accused of something you didn't do, why be angry?
And you don't have to excuse yourself either.
And you shouldn't dig into the motives of the prosecutors either.
You have to stay calm and cold.”
Flasher appeared to have compared Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being too angry during Thursday’s hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran for the Waters seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s very important,” he writes.
In a statement, Waters said her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these frauds.
“We will make sure that the criminals are found, and that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which can be destructive and dangerous to everyone and every one of my employees.”
Johnny English strikes again – a weak parody of spy Rowan Atkinson
Today it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which the UK is somehow depicted; this also applies to the new parody espionage franchise "Agent Johnny Inglesh", the production of which was overloaded in 2003 and continued in 2011 by the film "Inglesman".
Will the self-ironic picture with the leitmotiv “obviously we’re all bullshit” become a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, the eyebrows of profan Johnny Inglesh with a rubber face got his right to chaos for the second time — this is his name most clearly suggests that he is a widescreen comic creation intended for non-English cinematic auditory.
The hero, of course, is a silly secret agent who, despite his odd claims for glamour smudge, received a little Clouseau, features of Mr. Bin and a portion of this guy who brought a single note to Olpies in the melody Chariots of Fire in London in 2012.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the personality of the traveler and the mysterious "international" Atkinson, who once played in the now forgotten television advertisement Barclaycard, in which the character leaves chaos behind.
In this last release I have one or two pleasant moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the blades sliding around his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates Atkinson’s gift for physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because such “serious” movie experiences as “Agent 007” and “Mission Impossible” are now offered.
The sense that humor is meant for children, not adults, and for me, the odd abuses of Johnny Inglesh are not as inventive and appropriate as Atkinson’s mockery of Mr. Bine’s films.
The constant message now is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker penetrated a top-secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of emergency agent Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, an episodic role was achieved.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, a swollen and strenuous figure already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the Quasi-Therese May character, but the script has nothing to do with it.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of resignation.
And here on the stage is Johnny Inglesh himself, who is now working as a school teacher at some point institution, but also gives informal lessons of secret operative work: there are a few good jokes in the pub, because Inglesh offers the chicks.
Inglesh returns to Whitehall for emergency instruction and reunites with his former unhappy friend Buff, whom this time Ben Miller plays.
Buff is now a married man who submits to the commander of the submarine – the role of “fun hockey clues”, in which Vicky Pepperdin is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game because her Majesty's secret service made terrible mistakes. They are confronted by a beautiful rock woman, Ofelia Bullet, as performed by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems—the vicious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglesh and Buff begin their odyssey of farce jokes: masked under waitresses, they burn up a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on the luxurious yacht of Volta; Inglesh creates a whole anarchy, trying to use the interguru
All these scenes, of course, are a cute and boring invention, but there is something quite childish in all of this.
Pretty moderate things.
And as with other Johnny Inglesh films, I couldn’t help thinking: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that’s really proportional to his talent?
Workers deny that they are developing a plan to cut the British working week to four days for a five-day wage.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is going to consider a radical plan according to which the British will work four days a week, but will be paid in five days.
The party is reported to want the company’s managers to give workers the savings obtained as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, providing them with an extra weekend.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
Sources said the idea “fits in” on the party’s economic agenda and will help the country’s population become on the side of the workers.
The trade union congress approved a four-day work week transition so that workers could benefit from the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source said The Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is our goal, which corresponds to the Party’s approach to changing the balances in the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the Party’s general industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week still during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered a party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to concretize his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the “little directors” and “speculators” of utility firms.
Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current water channel shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour government may make “taxes” based on alleged abuses.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the boards of directors of companies and set up the Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the capital to private sector firms who will be able to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say “60 Minutes” if the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment as Supreme Judge for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could encourage any Republican senators to support Kavanaugh.
In an interview shown on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything to force them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” said Kennedy.
“When I went to the meeting, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, this information came up, I asked, “Did you do that?”
His response was decisive, definite and unambiguous.”
But Graham’s opinion in the vote remained unambiguous.
“I’ve been firmly determined about Brett Kavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments that are comparable to that of dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing for sure: Brett has strongly denied all of this,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
“None of those whom she called as witnesses were able to confirm these facts either.
This story has been for 36 years.
I didn’t see anything new in it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event in which an impressive stellar group with an astounding mission – the end of poverty worldwide.
For the seventh year as part of the Citizens of the World Festival, tens of thousands of people are flocking to the main square of Central Park, but not only to enjoy the performances of performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, as well as to tell about the real purpose of the event.
The World Citizens Festival, which opened in 2012, is a continuation of the global poverty-fighting project carried out by an international group of human rights defenders, hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you are not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), you must have participated in a volunteer activity or sent an email to the world leader, make a phone call or perform any other or other important actions aimed at helping.
But how successful has the World Citizens Festival been in 12 years in terms of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people for free attending a concert really persuading fellow citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” when people believe they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending a message?
Global Citizen organizers say that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” held by its supporters have been registered at the festival, which pursues many different goals.
As a result of these actions, world leaders have pledged to allocate more than <0x24>37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements that were made as a result of its actions, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been paid or collected.
According to the group, the funds allocated directly helped nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the 700 most significant commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: the British partnership of investors and implementation specialists committed to “helping children to fully unlock their potential” was promised to provide Rwanda with <0x24>35 million in global revenue.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of inadequate nutrition in the past history,” said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman in a statement.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions were undertaken urging the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will cover 5 million women and children through activities aimed at improving nutrition.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the festival’s website: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen organizers respond: “This will be a long and difficult path that we will stumble and fall on from time to time.
But as in the great movements of the struggle for civil rights and against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janel Monet are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, and its leaders will be Deborah Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use naval navy to “block” to prevent Russian energy exports: Interior Minister
U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said Washington could “if necessary” resort to the help of its naval fleet to prevent Russian energy carriers from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia’s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to trade in energy the same way they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, in conjunction with our fleet, has the ability to ensure the openness of sea routes and, if necessary, the blockade so that their energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “power consumer’s voice” in the United States.
He further compares Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,” the minister said, calling Russia a “one-truck pony” whose economy depends on fossil fuel.
The statements came as the Trump administration set the task of increasing its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, offering a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step out of the “inappropriate” North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion North Stream 2 project, which is expected to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I underline that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to put pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Mozambique.
The U.S. position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the face of the German Industry Federation (BDI) have called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third state interferes in our energy supply, it creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren will study the possibilities of balloting for president in 2020
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would carefully study the possibility of voting for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting of the city council in Holioke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering participating in the election race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and “repair” our broken government, and for that, we need a woman,” Warren The Hill said.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider the possibility of ballotting for presidents.”
Warren appreciated President Donald Trump’s actions during the meeting: “This district is heading in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both Trump himself and his nominee for Supreme Judge Brett Cavano.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, we need to conduct an FBI investigation before we start voting.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that most of Warren’s voters don’t think it should run in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies, 58% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not vote.
Thirty-two percent of respondents, on the contrary, supported her plans.
The poll showed that the population is more in favour of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent are in favour of his possible election participation and 48 per cent are against.
Other well-known names of Democrats that have been discussed in connection with the 2020 outlook include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin talks about Trace Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a meeting with Donald Trump's voters
Trek Palin, 26, who served in the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same things as members of other families suffering from PTSD and having had injuries, and our soldiers are returning with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tales, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a white eye" and said of her son and other war veterans: "They are already returning to others, angry, asking whether their comrades, soldiers, pilots, and any other military, have the same respect."
Trak Pailin was arrested on Monday in Vasile, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, intervening in a situation of violence and storage of weapons in an alcoholic state, according to Dana Bennett, a representative of the Vasile police department.
18 States, District of Columbia, Support the Challenge of New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that prohibits the granting of asylum to victims of refugee or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and counties filed an analytic note in Washington, D.C., a court consultant on support for a policy-controversial asylum seeker.
The full name of the plaintiff in the “Grace vs. Sessions” lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband "and his sons, who are part of a criminal group", subjected her to ill-treatment, but on July 20 U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
Attorneys in support of Grace say El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are filing a large number of asylum applications in the U.S. as countries facing widespread problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has repealed a decision taken by the Immigrant Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed immigrants without documents evacuated from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Carl Rasin, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of application of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law requires that all applications for asylum be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a ban violates this principle,” the court adviser said in a statement.
Lawyers also argue that a policy banning immigrants from entering the U.S. is damaging the U.S. economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens that is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessance ordered immigration judges no longer to provide asylum to victims of domestic or gang violence.
“Asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, or belonging to a particular social group or political beliefs,” he said in a statement.
This tool has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Palu: the number of dead doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more difficult.
“It’s very difficult now,” says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma’s mother, comforting her sick baby in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Each minute of ambulance brings the wounded.
“Clean water in a big deficiency.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig in wet things and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who had a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rested near the army hospital in Palu, where the patients were treated outdoors because they were forced to leave the room due to ongoing intensity.
He is crying, remembering how a severe earthquake destroyed a hotel room on the fifth floor he was shooting with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
“I think I was stuck in the walls,” Harris told the Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming, asking for help, and then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they have survived, and now they are all well.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "attacks" carried out through "propaganda"
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. daily newspaper that spoke about the mutual benefits of U.S. trade and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to disperse.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid supplement to the Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in Iowa, speaking on charges against China in an attempt to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections is a confirmation of the fact that U.S. officials told Reuters: a new stage is coming in Washington’s growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalation in the trade war, as a result of which they are equalizing tariffs on their countries’ imports.
China’s tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at striking exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa long-term governor, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claims Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad, in an article published in the Sunday magazine Des Moines Register, “is now doubling this trend by placing propaganda in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government enjoys our dear heart the American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, paying off and placing advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“However, in the newspaper kiosks here, in the streets of Beijing, you will hardly hear the different voices and you will not see the true diversity of opinions that the Chinese might be familiar with when they learn about China’s worrying economic policy,” he said.
He also added that one of China’s most famous newspapers “dipped out” from the offer to publish his article, although it did not bring the exact title of the publication.
Analysts Warn: Republicans Repel Women Voters Before Interim Period by Variety of Kavanaugh
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stay aside and defend the candidacy of Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh, despite several statements about sexual violence. Analysts warn that there is a negative reaction that can be traced back here, especially by women.
Emotions surrounding the situation have escalated to extremes, and the majority of Republicans have officially stated that they want to continue voting.
You can’t go back to such things later,” writes Grant Rier, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in his article published on Saturday.
Ryer doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s attempts to conduct the FBI’s last-minute investigation will be enough to soothe angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it neither tomorrow nor in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national representative of the MoveOn Progressive Group in Washington, D.C., Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November ahead!” against the Senate, when Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run for Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the limits,” non-partisan political scientist Stu Rottenberg said on the news site.
“People say that the situation has been so tense already, and that’s true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of women voters in suburbs and young voters aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for the supreme judge, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirmed the promotion, the move could trigger a response.
“It’s already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Stile, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about a committee vote or a final vote or whether Kavanaugh sat on the bench of the defendants, but also about how Republicans deal with it, how they treat it,” said Gay Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group based on which he said.
However, the Americans seem to have a bit of a split on the question of who to believe anyway – Ford or Kavanaugh, and a little more inclined towards the latter.
A new YouGov survey showed that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s statements accurately or most likely, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh exactly or most likely.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh most likely or definitely lied at the time of his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
At Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford was sworn in by the Senate Legal Committee to testify that Kavanaugh, being drunk, attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the post of supreme judge showed her her genitals at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people to give access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that Inrupt’s goal is to gain “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he says about his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It may contain contact lists, cases, as well as a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools for working with data.
The app works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify – all can be used in one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of an online personal data storage is that it is fully managed by a user who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal enlargement of rights and opportunities through data”.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company has provided the resources, processes and related skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several staff developers with whom the project is contracted, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether his company is worth making the fundamental changes that will make all of their business models completely change overnight.
“We don’t ask them for permission.”
In his post on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee’s voice has sounded quite influential in the debates on net neutrality.
Even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: a church servant awarded Victoria's Cross during the First World War
In the history of the Anglican church, only one priest-warrior was rewarded with the Victorian Cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his involvement in the attack on Bellenglise and Louvre.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
The monument in honor of this event was solemnly presented by his two grandchildren at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “very symbolic” that the monument was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Newspaper of September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann conducted his battalion through the Saint-Canton Canal "in a very dense fog and under a strong fire of field weapons and guns."
Later he threw himself on the line of fire and with the "best courage" led the group forward, and then with one hand he threw the field rifle, killing the three soldiers of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old granddaughter of the hero Michael Vann said that “he would hardly have been able to do the same heroically, but it humbles.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wristband at the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that "it is a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the kindness of a true hero is confirmed by support that will be provided by many people."
MMA fans didn’t sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead showed them Peppa Pig
Imagine you didn’t sleep all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you weren’t allowed to see the main event.
The San Jose table contained 13 battles, including six of the main program's battles, the battles were broadcast all night live on UK's 5 TV channels.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, British fans were shocked to see Peppa Pig on screens.
Some fans weren’t impressed at all, because they didn’t sleep until the morning just to watch the fight.
One of the fans on Twitter called this change of broadcasting a children’s cartoon “some sick joke.”
“The government issued a decree that this content was inappropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications, Bellator, when asked why it happened.
"Yes, "Pig Peppa."
Bellator President Scott Cocker said they plan to set up a schedule so that future fights can also be watched by viewers from the UK.
“As for the re-show, I think we’ll be able to solve this issue,” Cocker said.
“But there’s a Sunday, six in the morning, and we’re not going to be able to solve this issue until Sunday in our time, and for them it’s already Monday.
But we will make the most of our efforts.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, there was a lot of text messages, and all of them were far from friendly.
We tried to solve this problem right away, thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out that no, it was a matter of state importance.
I promise that this will not happen the next time.
We’re going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we’re trying to increase that number, but there’s been an overlap.
Yes, it did not work well.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daylee Feeling Inadequate Because of His Sexual Orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that’s what motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t understand that “all are not like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that winning the Olympics became less of a concern to him after he had a child.
The permanent lead of the multi-year show, Kirsti Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who played the lead guest on Laverne, said he felt "more valuable than any of his peers" because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
“Until today, these feelings of worthlessness and inappropriateness were quite real, but they gave me strength, and I was able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something meaningful” in order not to disappoint everyone when they eventually learn about his sexual orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a well-known LGBT activist and in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on the countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was fortunate to have been able to live an open life without consequences, and wanted to give others “hope.”
A three-time world champion said that feelings for the man, the American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “stopped him mad.”
Last year, Daly married an Oscar laureate who is 20 years older than him, but claims that the difference in age has never been a problem.
“If so much happens in your life at such a young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find a peer who would have had the same cardinally opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daily said that "his whole worldview" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it would be all about ‘I need to win a gold medal’,” the athlete said.
“But you know, there are things more important than the Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale told me that his father didn't want to deal with the fact that he was dying, and one of his last requests was that they were tickets to the first row to the London 2012 competition.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be around then, and you won’t be able to sit there in the first row,’” Dale says.
“I held him in my hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing, I finally realized that he wasn’t invincible,” the athlete said.
The following year, Daly participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – dive in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, there wasn’t a better feeling,” he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small — that helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes it so much.

Michaelson, not in shape, held this Saturday Ryder's Cup on the bench
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to pull the form to avoid an unpleasant heel.
Michaelson, who played for the record 12th time, was sent by captain Jim Furick to the bar on Saturday for four balls and four quarters.
Instead of being at the center of events, as it has often been in the United States, a five-time major winner has split his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in hopes of correcting what worries him.
Never had the most direct hit, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete is not the perfect candidate for the hard track Le Golf National, where a long raft usually punishes for inaccurate hits.
And if the course itself isn’t scary enough, Michelson in the ninth game will meet the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari on Sunday, who joined the newcomer Tommy Flytwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who have lost four points in 12 singles matches make a fierce start, Michelson’s match may be decisive.
Ferrick expressed confidence in his partner, though what else he could say.
“He fully understood the role that was assigned to him today, stabbed me in the back, hugged me and said that he would be ready tomorrow,” Ferrick said.
“He’s pretty confident in himself.
He's a walking Hall of Fame, and he's done so much for these teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two games.
I hoped for more, but it was the way it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone.”
On Sunday, Michaelson will beat Nick Foldo's record for the number of games in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of Ryder’s career, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Ferrick said his presence brought a great deal of benefit to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, clever, he likes to inspire people, and he’s a great guy with whom he’s interesting,” he explained.
“I think the young players had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big advantage could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that significant leadership in the Ryder Cup singles can easily turn into an unfavorable side.
The Danish debuted in the match in 1997 in Walderram, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had an advantage of five points over the Americans, but surpassed the finish line only slightly 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 with a 13<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2, with the smallest difference of 14.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Walderrama; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram, where we won, but only so far," Björn said, "The result is that, as recorded in the photo, we had a big advantage in the year, after watching the National Class 5.
So the story will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you're going to be full.
Go and do the right thing.
Until the glasses are on the board – nothing is over yet.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win trophies, and that’s what we need to focus on.
“I didn’t speak silently, focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we know so well that we stand against the biggest players in the world.”
Satisfied with how his players performed on an uncomfortable golf course for them, Bjorn added: “I would never have surpassed myself in this.
Tomorrow we will have another test.
Tomorrow, individual performances will begin, and this is a completely different matter.
It’s always nice to be with a partner when things go well, but when you stay there alone, you experience all your strength as a professional golfer.
It is this idea that players need to be encouraged to stand up to the full tomorrow.
Now the partner is left behind, and he must also put all his efforts into it.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferrick, believes that individually his players will perform better than their partners, with the exception of Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Ferrick himself went through all this carousel in the last few days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn, before finally losing when Europe had a “miracle in the Medie”.
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Cranshaw, the captain in 1999, reunited his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to finish it as soon as possible, as in Brooklyn, as in the Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
“We have appropriately built our plan for the game and set the guys up the way we thought it was right, you know? Tomorrow we’ll try to make a miracle.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting Rory Mackilroy in the top game with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flittwood and Ayyan Polter, as well as other European players from the top turkey.
“I’ve chosen this group of guys, and in that order, because I think that’s how they’ll cover all possible shortcomings,” Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
Introduction of Germany’s new warship is postponed again
The newest fleet of the German fleet was to be put into service in 2014 to replace the older warships of the Cold War era, but this will not happen even less next year due to malfunctioning systems and lavender-like cost increases.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the main ship of the completely new Baden-Württemberg class, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit newspaper, referring to a military representative.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery made the fate of the ambitious project more difficult.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the naval fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they will have a powerful rifle, numerous anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stells technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer service periods – should be able to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, a permanent postponement of entry into service means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power overseas, are already outdated by the time they get into service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 was headlined last year when the German naval fleet officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless when used in battle.
Software shortcomings were particularly critical as Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half of the workforce on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it has been found that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to implement updates in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is estimated to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class that were used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of holding on the anchor of the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings about the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged that the naval forces were actually “ending up the supply of ships capable of deploying.”
The official said that the problem had been exacerbated over time because the old ships had been decommissioned, but the ships had not been provided for them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could ever be armed by the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of flying mice
A new study, conducted in one of the Scottish mountain ranges, aims to show how flying mice use the landscape in search of food.
It should be hoped that the data obtained will allow a new look at the behavior of unique wing mammals and help in further activities to preserve the species.
The study, organised by the Scottish National Foundation, will study the common illusory, illusory soprano, as well as the brown long-haired flying mice and Dobanton nocturnals inhabiting Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at some points around the site to track the actions of flying mice throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile field surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screams, as well as the activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
Then a map of the habitat will be drawn up and a report prepared to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Duar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important for flying mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will help identify the main areas of work on the management of the habitat, such as the formation of ponds, as well as ways to maintain forest massifs in a state that is optimal for flying mice and other related species.
The population of flying mice in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
They are at risk of disappearance due to construction and development works that affect their habitat and the loss of the environment.
Wind turbines and lighting systems can be dangerous, as well as flies adhesive tape, chemical processing of building materials, and cat hunting.
In fact, flying mice are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting for mining.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to accurately identify obstacles along the flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the population of flying mice very seriously.
The organization employs ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, exit checks, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even created Scotland’s first and only flying mice reservation at the Threave estate in Damfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of Scottish flying mice live.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here, in Threave, is a great place for flying mice,” he says.
“There are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of a good habitat.
But much about flying mice remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need for a healthy existence.”
It reminds of the importance of checking the presence of flying mice before conducting technical maintenance within private holdings, as the unintentional destruction of one nest can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young individuals, and possibly even the destruction of the entire area.
Flying mice are protected by law, their destruction, grazing or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer at the Flying Mouse Conservation Foundation, is calling on the public to help.
She says, “We still have a lot to learn about our flying mice, and we just don’t know how many different species live in them.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, and his lawyers are going to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo denies allegations of rape against him, calling them “fake news,” and claiming that people are simply “willing to procrastinate” using his name.
His lawyers are going to go to court for the German newspaper Spiegel, which has published allegations against the footballer.
Forward of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga, who allegedly took place in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her <0x24>375,000 to talk about the incident, Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a video on Instagram, in which the footballer has 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the information "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
“What they said today is all fake news,” said the five-time Ballon d’Or winner on camera.
“They just want to get away with using my name.
That's okay.
They want to be famous, my name is pronounced, but that’s only part of their work.
I’m a happy person, and I have everything great,” adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the Spiegel for allegations they called “unacceptable information about suspicions of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Shertz said the player intends to claim compensation for “moral damage to the extent corresponding to the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
It is alleged that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the room of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Having met at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga reportedly returned to the player's room where he allegedly raped her in an anal form, according to documents filed at Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on her knees and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy, but fell by one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that was by mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she had contacted the police and shots of her injuries were taken in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt “fear that she would be avenged” and was afraid of “public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to change her place of residence as she continues to experience traumatic feelings caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain 'repents on the car manufacturers that are lost forever'
Business and Entrepreneurship Minister Greg Clarke said Britain would “repent forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He also commented on the information that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could lead to job losses.
The plant in Bernaston produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be halted,” said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have expressed concerns about exiting the EU without an international trade agreement, including for Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini production plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to automakers, in the absence of a Brexit deal, supply chains will be put at great risk.
Toyota’s production line is being launched “on time,” and car parts made to order are delivered by suppliers in the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be failures at the border, which, according to industry representatives, could lead to delays and lack of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store stocks at its Derbyshire plant for more than one day, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU was “exactly calibrated to avoid these checks at the border.”
“We need a deal. We want to make a better deal that will allow, I repeat, not only to achieve success now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers claim that we should be absolutely able to continue our successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to clarify how long production will be halted, but has warned in the longer term that additional costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job cuts.
Peter Tzuvalaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the factory’s trade union, says the concern of the organization’s members is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will no longer be able to return them.”
A government spokesman said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s senior meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed to another week” as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein takes care of the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, links between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential obstacles to justice by the president.
Whether Trump would fire the Deputy Attorney General, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, in Washington for many months has caused a lot of conjecture.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of the wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in order to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the UN at the time in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judicial Committee, at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Forcasi.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation into FBI complaints against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied, “The date of this meeting has not yet been set, perhaps this week, or perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all the other events happening in the Supreme Court.”
But let’s see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not held briefings at the White House since September 10.
Leading Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the absence of briefings was not caused by a “consideration to the community” of television reporters, although she added, “I will not deny that they are playing in the public.”
She proposed to increase the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
"The president holds more meetings, answering questions of journalists than any other president before him," she added, without adding, however, exact figures: "We have these figures."
Sanders said the briefings will continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.”
“We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we’ve held over the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it’s a worthy replacement for press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions, leaving the White House, attending open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking figures.
Press conferences are very rare in general.
The president’s voluntary, and sometimes strange, behavior in front of journalists in New York this week may be the answer to why it is so.
Minister of Health addresses EU workers in Scotland with a letter on concerns about Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The health minister has appealed to EU officials working in Scotland’s GSZ to express his gratitude for the country’s ownership and wish them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, addressed the letter to employees less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the cost of filing status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of exit have continued, and an expected decision should be made this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also stepping up its preparations for a possible scenario with no deals.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie Has Postponed Emergency Surgery for Head Injury
Michael Organ of Tennessee reported that Tennis State Tigers midfielder Christian Abercrombie had undergone an emergency operation, having suffered a head injury on Saturday after a 31–27 defeat in the game against Vanderbilt Commodore.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reid told reporters that the injury was received shortly before the break.
“He went out to the sideline and just crashed there,” Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting it on the carriers and putting it on for medical examination.
A Tennessee official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was undergoing surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet about the type/degree of injury,” and Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, who had just entered the second course, it was the first season in the Tennessee State since moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher gun fee when buying a property in the UK.
In accordance with the new Tori plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher shell fee when buying a property in the UK, and the extra cash earned will be used to help homeless people.
This step will reduce the results of Corbyn’s attempts to attract young voters
Increased gun fee will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in favor of homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rifle fee when buying a property in the UK, and the extra cash earned will be used to help the homeless - this will be announced today by Theresa May.
This move will reduce the results of Corbyn’s attempts to attract young voters, which promises to make housing more affordable and increase citizens’ incomes.
Increased gun collection will be charged to non-tax individuals and firms in the UK, and the additional funds thus generated should stimulate the government’s efforts to help homeless citizens.
The surplus to the existing armor fee, including the increase introduced two years ago for the acquisition of secondary housing and rental housing, may be up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects this move to generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of London’s new properties are purchased by non-British residents, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for buyers buying their first home to improve their housing conditions later on.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who, by buying housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the shell fee to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction firms of tightening property prices by acquiring land, but not actually using them, and urged Mrs. May to give up affordable housing quotas to correct the “humiliating housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include monitoring the lease and the cessation of unreasonable displacement.
It also wants to give local self-government authorities more power to build new homes.
“Last year, I said I dedicated my premiere to fulfilling the British dream of making life better with each new generation,” May said.
And this, among other things, means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is unfair that for people who are not citizens of the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, real estate acquisitions are as accessible as for hard-working British people.
For too many people, the dream of acquiring their own home has become too far away, and the threat for some to be on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to rule Scotland”
Sunderland club boss Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the revival of the North-East club, which currently ranks third in the first league, separating from the championship by three points.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got the hat B, and that's all," Ross Sportsound told BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching as a child with my father for Scotland in Hampton, and it always attracted me back.
However, such an opportunity will only come if I can become a successful manager of the club.”
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland's managers were also Dicka Advokaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy King, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says he hasn’t been shy about such authoritative names in such big clubs, having previously abandoned Barnsley and Ipswich Town’s proposals.
"For me, success for the moment will depend on whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
By its structure and capabilities, this club is undoubtedly a member of the Premier League,” said the coach.
"Bringing him out there is not a difficult task, but I will consider that I have managed my task only if I can get the club back."
Ross worked as manager for only three years, first as an assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spent 15 months at the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa rise from the third level and the following season took St Mirren from the lower positions to the championship winners.
Ross says he feels more comfortable today than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
“I honestly believe that management is more suited to me than a game.
That sounds strange because I did everything well, I made a lot of money in this position, and I made some progress.
But the game is more complicated.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I still feel stressed at work, but I feel good in the position of manager.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now, doing this, I feel the most comfortable like a fish in the water throughout my adult life.”
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on the radio of Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 English Summer Time.
According to the results of the survey, 17:30 is the perfect time for a pint of beer
The summer heat led to increased sales of British pubs, but decreased sales in restaurants networks.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, and in restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of CGA’s business consulting firm, which received this statistic, says: “Continuous solar activity, as well as longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Cup means that July was the same as last month, June, when sales increased by 8%.
The June revenue drop in restaurant trade by 1.8% also continued in July.
The pubs and bars that sell alcohol showed much higher results comparable in restaurants.
Pubs who only sell food were also affected by the heat of the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
It feels like people want to jump out on the street just to miss a glass.
Sales of beverages in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% per month and food by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM analyst for leisure and hotel business, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve been following since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the non-commercial market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, especially since a 4.8 percent annual sales drop will be particularly painful due to the ongoing price pressure.
A long, hot summer has proved to be unprecedented for operators working with food, and it is not yet the fact that August, bringing more moderate temperatures, will give so much necessary breathing.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including re-opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitoring for the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 networks with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is a recognized industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
According to the survey, one in five children – some aged just 11 – have secret social media accounts that he hides from parents and teachers.
Survey of 20,000 high school students detected the growth of “fake insta” pages
This news has heightened concerns about sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “basic” account that parents know about.
However, one in five children – some only 11 years old – create accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake accounts "Instagram" - that is, Instagram, a site for sharing photos.
This news has heightened concerns about the publications of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a basic, “clean” account that their parents had access to, but they also had secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally got access to her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account, encountered a teenager there who called on others to “rape him.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two social media profiles, with half of them admitting that one is usually secret.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “Many teens seek to create online spaces that are not accessible to their parents and teachers, and that’s a worrying fact.”
Eileen Doyle to Become the "voice of athletes" of Scottish light athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eileen Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Light Athletics as a member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most prestigious athlete in athletics. President Yen Bitty says this step is a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of the extensive experience of the athlete internationally over the past decade.
“Eilid enjoys tremendous respect in the Scottish, British, and global athletic community, and we are confident that its participation will bring enormous benefits to light athletics in Scotland,” said Bitty.
Doyle says: “I strive to be the voice of athletes, and I hope to be able to make a really good contribution and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and now works as a regular commentator on the BBC, after a stroke he lost his ability to walk.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I have lost the ability to move.
The doctors said that only time will show if I am going to recover, and if so, to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again, and today I’m doing exercises for agility!
Thank you so much for your support!”
Advertising a milk pump, in which breastfeeding mothers compared to cows, shares the opinions of internet users
The dairy company has sparked controversy on the Internet by publishing an advertisement in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to breastfeeding cows.
Launching on the market, as they say, “the world’s first silent milk pump that can be worn on the breast”, consumer technology company Elvie has released an advertising music video demonstrating the freedom that the new milk pump provides to the consumers.
Four real moms are dancing in a full-fledged cowboy under a music track with the words, "Yes, I'm feeding my own milk, but you won't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not washing, it's my breast."
And the chorus goes on to say, "We sneeze, we sneeze, we feed our babies with breast milk, we sneeze, we sneeze."
This advertisement video, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video received ambiguous reaction from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them within a few days after birth,” writes one user.
Elvie Milk Suction Dressed Directly Under a Special Bra (Elvie/Mother)
But another comment: “It’s just as traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who leave their children to themselves?”
Another user adds: “Advertising that is detached from reality.”
Others, on the contrary, defended the film, and one woman even wrote that the song was "just magnificent".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I had a baby, I would have bought one.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel cowy.
Advertising, of course, is a bit crazy, but that’s how it feels.
“It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
And another comment: "Pretty advertising is aimed at moms who breastfeed (often they do it directly in their workplaces or in the toilet), and who, indeed, feel a little bit "cows."
This advertising is not to praise or ridicule our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with these invisible milk pumps hidden under the bra.
The concept of this advertising campaign is precisely based on the fact that many women who are breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
In fact, the milk pump Elvie is absolutely insensitive, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in the breastfeeding bra, and at the same time is invisible, giving women the opportunity to move, hold babies and even go out on the street during feeding.
Ana Ballarin, a partner and early childhood development specialist at Mother, comments: “Elvie’s milk vacuum is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
By making a parallel between women and breastfeeding cows, we wanted to draw attention to breastfeeding and all its problems, while demonstrating in a funny and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk pump gives.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s milk pump has gotten into the headlines.
During London fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Yakubovskaya, using this product as intended.
Hundreds of migrant children have moved unhindered to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be placed in debtors.
Usually, most sponsors themselves are the same immigrant without documents, and are afraid to risk their stay in the country, taking the child under the supervision of a child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential landlords and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints, and that these data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking Immigration and Customs officer, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had been asked to take over the unattended minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees were not previously prosecuted.
About 80 percent of those who are either debtors or members of their families are illegally in the country, and a significant proportion of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
That’s why we continue to harass these people,” Albens said.
According to the shelter workers, in an effort to accelerate the process of childcare, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not 60 days as before.
To declare their legal status as an immigration judge, many of them are present on video, not in person.
Those who are deemed not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and information that has appeared in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempted escape.
Lawyers say these problems are intensifying in larger institutions such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that if you transport children to tent camps, without giving them time to emotionally prepare or say goodbye to friends, it can exacerbate the injury that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., France and Turkey 'occupied forces' to withdraw troops immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country has been at war for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and “will be dealt with appropriately.”
“They have to leave immediately and without any conditions,” he told the crowd.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been expelled from their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over.”
He said Damascus would continue “this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has deployed about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
As for refugees, Mualem said good conditions had been created for their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to remain outside the country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be assisted in the restoration until a political agreement to end the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major insurgent siege of Idlib has created an opportunity for continuing political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia on the province, which is home to three million people.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines,” and expressed hopes that military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front, who would “be destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee will be convened in the near future, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem set out the conditions of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the work of the commission should be limited to “examination of the articles of the current constitution” and warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
Following this logic, Trump will win a re-election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal do not prematurely end his presidency, which is what many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
And this will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency in history!”
There are no signs of tiredness of the audience at the moment.
Since 2014, premium ratings have more than doubled – to 1.05 million on CNN and almost triple – to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prem-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed the ratings of new cable channels, collecting 3.5 million head-time viewers from the screens.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s beyond our understanding,” said Neil Barr, director of ABC’s Survivor Appointed, about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Scowell, a long-released comedy writer and author of Just Funny: A Few Unpleasant Truths About Invading Hollywood Boys' Club, proposes a different theory.
She remembers how she used to take a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her she would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, “Yes, because he’s funny,” Mrs. Skowell said.
In all this chaos there is something valuable - it's fun.
Of course, unlike all the rest of the content broadcast on television, the storylines on Washington’s events can define the future on the Road versus Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
The exception is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, when you look at the sixth hour in a row as a group of experts discusses Bob Woodward’s use of a “deep background” for his book “Fear,” or about Paul Manafort’s jacket for <0x24>15,000, it’s a <0x24>15,000 streak of straussy leather (clothes warmed up with pride), it’s a shampoo.
I’ll never look at Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“Part of his job is to make us feel that the reality show is that it feeds you something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Daily Pawn Stars.
You can’t afford to miss a single episode, or you’re hopelessly delayed.
When I contacted Mr. Fleas this week, the north coast of Kawai was 27 degrees warm, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't break off the screen, at least not exactly when they showed Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Legal Committee and decided on the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss said.
“Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Foreign currency is plunging into the harshest interim elections that the White House is leading
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives cash flow through a change of counties in Congress, in which two officials compete for the same place.
This suburb of Pittsburgh, whose geography has recently changed, is backed by a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is against another active official, Republican Kit Rothfuss, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly crossing the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January ruled that as a result of pre-election fraud, the old districts were attributable to Republicans in violation of the constitution.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated discussion on the funding of campaigns between the financial forces of the main party – the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba became famous in Pennsylvania after a win with a small difference in the widely observed March special elections in Congress in the 18th District of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give Democrats a little bit of an advantage.
U.S. penalized El Salvador for supporting China, but then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, which has caused Washington’s negative reaction.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama. His property was also in Panama until his partners displaced the Trump organization’s management team.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to revoke U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “recent decisions on Taiwan’s non-recognition,” the Department’s press secretary, Heather Nasser, said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, which received about <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial assistance and the targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would be painful for this Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and murder.
Against the backdrop of the regular internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed the high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to be held in order to bring about the outcome of a similar meeting, which was held last year.
However, by mid-September, senior officials of the administration had made it clear that they wanted the preparations for the conference to continue, and that the issue of the punishment of El Salvador had actually ceased.
According to the diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October and will be attended by Vice President Mike Pence in a sign that the administration is giving real importance to this meeting.
Three U.S. diplomats have safely returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or sanctions coming from Washington.
Mr. Bolton, a White House spokesman, declined to comment on the details of the debates discussed by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by a third-party analyst, who is in the administration, but also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history.
The next step could be a message from Special Adviser Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, which is currently very substantial evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly investigating the facts of the Trump campaign and its attacks in the past elections.
If Congress replaces the host, Mr. Trump will be held accountable in this body, just as he is preparing to speak again before voters, and perhaps eventually before jury colleagues.
But there’s a lot of “if”; I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we did not do so, and we missed the opportunity to avoid bloodshed in the years to come.
The course of history takes place at such points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are experiencing some of these breakthrough moments right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, last year he offered to make secret records of the president’s activities and discussed his inadequacy for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that The Times data is false.
“How will we react if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is still confirmed as a Supreme Judge despite credible accusations of sexual harassment and false confessions?
And above all, will we vote in the medium term for a Congress that will bring Mr. Trump to account?
If we don’t pass these tests properly, then this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to pass them in dignity thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, whose officials once occupied the embassy house where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later led me to light the Saturday candles on the table with a swastika symbol.
With such a family past, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”
Norman Eisen, senior scientist at the Brookings Institute, is chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, D.C., and author of The Last Palace: An Anxiety Age in Europe in the History of Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of a collision with the Vietnamese football club Rapid.
The Rangers are taking the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive win over the Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, will allow them to occupy strong positions in Group G of the European League.
The knee injury prevented Defender Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance in the season before the draw with a 2–2 score against the Williams Real, but he believes the Rangers could use the result as a trampoline to achieve great results.
“It was a good time for us because the Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game, thinking we could get something, and we left with nothing.
Maybe, in the end, we could have handled it, but in general, nothing was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first time, and our success came on the second time, where we showed ourselves better.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they showed a good result in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I’m sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely a tough one, given everything that has to do with my injuries and replacements in the club itself, but now there’s a good factor in this place.
The composition is beautifully selected, and the guys really get pleasure from it; the trainings went on a “short”.
"I hope we can move forward, leave behind last season and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of their retirement accumulations
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of them, few people spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the national study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10% said they talked about this with their children.
“People want someone in their family to take care of them, but they don’t try to discuss the issue with them,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
And that's what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family for what they will probably have to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your consultant and family where and how you will get medical care, as this choice can be an important cost-effective factor.
Consult with your financial advisor: he will help you develop a plan to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of long-term care financing may be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life insurance money policy that will help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own property provided you have money.
Bring your legal documents in order: get rid of legal battles.
Build trust in medical care and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that specialists fulfill your requests in case you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend considering the possibility of drawing up financial confidence.
You should choose a trusted person who will help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your bills in case you become incapacitated.
Do not forget about the little ones too: imagine that your older parent needed urgent medical care, and he is on his way to the hospital.
In this case, can you provide information about what medications he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write all these details on paper so that you can prepare for any occasion.
Martin added: “It is important not only to have finances, but also to choose doctors.”
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of your dog?
Write down and write down this plan.”
In Ilfracombe, a man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle
The man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle, returning home from a walk.
The victim, 40-year-old, in the chest, abdomen and arm of the bullets, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 p.m. in English summer time, as "accident".
The victim did not see the attacker.
Wounds are not life-threatening, police are currently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Because of the communication outage, rescuers could not get any information from Donggal, the area north of Palu, which is closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-point earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu as a result of the natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggal located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis occurred.
Donggala is a district that extends along 300 km (180 miles) of the coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, the administrative area less than the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, and in particular the coastal region of Donggal.
Nickel mining is also important for the province's economy, but is mainly concentrated in Moravali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of Natural Disasters, the tsunami has devastated Palu and Donggal several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggal.
The tsunami also occurred in the western part of Donggal in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Volcanic Fire Ring and is suffering from earthquakes on a regular basis.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami in 14 countries that killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes erupted on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami on the south coast that killed some 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred in Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake occurred on one of the islands of Mentawa near Sumatra, causing tsunamis of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The tsunami did not happen this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily left in ruins.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Basil, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, intervening in a situation where domestic violence took place, and for resisting arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up the phone from her.
According to KTUU, Pailin is in the Mat-Su insulator and will be released under a <0x24>500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his "unambiguous innocence".
Pailine is threatened with three small A-class crimes, which means that he may be deprived of his liberty for up to one year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B crime, punishable by imprisonment for up to one day and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Pailin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, falsifying a report of domestic violence and storing weapons in an alcoholic state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 after she explained her son’s brutal behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly obtained as a result of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-point quake has caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of casualties will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
In social media, there are videos of the incident.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the shore.
The Federal Prosecutor’s Office wants to pass a rare death sentence on suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutor's office is seeking the death penalty for Syfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - a rare sentence for a federal crime that has not been applied for 19 years.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" sustained serious bodily injuries, according to a notice of intent to obtain the death penalty filed in South New York District.
According to the court document, on both charges, a death sentence may be imposed.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read to Saipo a 22-point indictment, which included eight counts of murder for the purpose of a racket, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime and prosecution.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “decently planned and deliberate,” Saipov carried out it, as described, “in a disgusting, cruel and criminal way.”
"Saifullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Laurent Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Varya, Ariana Ferrucci, and Allena Ernuchi."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutor's death penalty was imposed in New York City's Southern District.
In September 2009, accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty in a federal case in New York City was applied in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the two-year Cold War.
Rosenberg was executed using an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was happy that he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to watch ISIL videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, police said.
He denies his guilt on all 22 points of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders speaking on Saipov's side, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, not life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only exacerbate the pain of these events for all of their participants,” Patton said.
The defense of Saipova had previously addressed the prosecutors with a request not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Findel Farage Shouldn't Be Responsible for Brexit Negotiations
Today, during the protest at the Tori conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the People’s Army”.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel inclined” by Eurosceptics, as one member of parliament, Theresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party member Peter Boone said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain would have been “out” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
However, the problem that Mrs. May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is further compounded by the fact that members of the Tori party, who are opposed to leaving the EU, are joining a separate protest against Brexit that is taking place in the city.
The prime minister is trying to preserve his compromise plan announced in Checkers at the outset of attacks by Brexit supporters, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that it continue to try to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr. Boone said at the “Leave Means Leave” rally in Solihall that he wanted to “play the Checkers.”
He proposed that Mr Farage be leveled and responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have gone out,” he said.
Wellingboro added: “I will continue to support Brexit, but we need to defeat the Checkers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to enact our laws in our country.”
Mr. Boone rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely unrealistic.”
Tory Andrea Jenkins, a Brexit supporter, was also at the rally, giving reporters the following comment: “I’m saying, Prime Minister, just listen to the people.”
“Checkers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, he is also unpopular with members of our party and our activists who actually storm the streets and choose us in the first place.
“Please put the Checkers aside and start listening to what they’re telling you.”
In her sharp appeal to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers remain at work if they remain faithful to their promises.”
Farage said that if politicians are going to give up the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they should be forced to “feel stone.”
“It’s now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to take it out of your hands.’”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class on the brink of Brexit betrayal to feel stoned.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which gives us victory in Brexit, and we will not calm down until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit opponents went through a demonstration in Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists have been sparking “Tories vs Brexit” posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Labour Party member Lord Adonis criticized Conservatives for security issues in their party’s mobile application.
“And these people claim that they can customize IT systems and technology Canada plus, for work at borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit in principle,” he said.
Warren plans to “measure” the possibility of participating in the presidential race
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would “provide a thorough study of the possibilities of balloting the president.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about his future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against Republican Party member Jeff Dyle, who was co-chair of Trump’s campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There are talks that she has a chance to take up the Trump post in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she held a regular meeting with voters in Holiok; since Trump took office, this has been her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a town hall meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was time for “women to go to Washington to “repair” our broken government, and for that to happen, there needs to be a woman up there.”
As a result of the murder of Sims, the LSU player was arrested.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said on Saturday that the suspect in the murder (shooting) of LSU basketball player Wade Sims, who happened on Friday, was arrested.
At 11:00 a.m. English time at a press conference, Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department released a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who was shot on the video.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot at the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Waye Sims received a gunshot wound to his head, which resulted in his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade ran for his friend, and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being involved in the incident, carrying a gun and shooting at Wade Sims.
During his arrest, Simpson did not resist and was detained in the police department of East Baton Rouge County.
The young man with a height of 1 m 82 cm grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and scored an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 selections per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Champion title after team tactics gave him victory over Sebastian Fettel
Ever since Valteri Bottas passed the qualification on Saturday, bypassing Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that the Mercedes team tactics will play a major role in the race.
From the pole position Bottas started well and practically hung on Hamilton, when he defended his position in the first two laps, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to go on a pit-stop, leaving Hamilton in the tail of the entire band – a choice that became decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit-stop one lap later, and after leaving behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some "wheel to wheel" fight, broke forward, which led to the driver unwillingly leaving a free space for the interior.
On his 21st birthday, Max Farstopen started from the back row of the net and was seventh to the end of the first round.
He then led most of the race, sticking to his home tyres, in order to quickly finish, blaming Kimi Rykkonen for fourth place.
In the end, he went pit-stop in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds, as Ryckonen took fourth place.
The day turned out to be difficult because Walterie did a fantastic job on the weekends and showed real nobility by sharing it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in stock,” Hamilton said.
Traitor's sign language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Dyanne Finnstein at a voter meeting on Saturday for her claim that she had not published a letter to Christina Blaise Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh of being a candidate for Supreme Court judge.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony to the Senate Legal Committee, saying what was happening in the Senate showed that the participants of these events were “humiliating, ugly and false people.”
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what’s happening in the Senate in the last few days, is wonderful, it’s anger, anger, hatred, and lies,” he said.
“You see all these leaks, and then they say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Diane Finnstein, did you “mix” the information?
Do you remember her answer... you "submitted" the information of the document? - "what, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't melt.
Yeah, stop.
We did not “mix” — we did not “mix,” he added with the intonation of the senator.
In July, Finnstein was sent a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally published, but Finnstein denies that the leak occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, but I didn’t share her information,” Finnstein told The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information a secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied allegations of leakage seems to have displeased the president, who commented on it during a Saturday rally: “Here’s what I’m going to tell you: the body language has really deceived her.
She may not have “mixed,” but the body language was the worst I’ve ever seen.
Continuing to defend his candidate for the position of supreme judge, which three women have been accused of sexual harassment, the president has assumed that Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
“They are definitely trying to regain power in all available ways.
“We are seeing the subtlety, the ugliness, they don’t care who they insult, through whom they have to step in to gain power and control,” Mediaite said.
British elite hockey league: "Dandy Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Jayants in a game against the Dundee.
In the game of the Elite Hockey League, "Dandy Stars" were paid for Friday's defeat against the Belfast Giants, winning a return game on Saturday with a score of 5-3 in favor of "Dandy".
The Jayants were given an early lead in two goals thanks to the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowler.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the home team before Dwayer took the Jayants to the top.
Francois Bushar compares the account to "Dandy" before the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen secured their victory.
For the people of Adam Kiff, who won the 2-1 victory over the Dandy in Belfast on Friday night, it was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
This was the fourth match between the sides of the season, when the Jayants won three previous matches.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after goal goaltender Kendall McFall with the support of David Rutherford, after which Bowler doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markward assisted Cooney in leveling the score at 15:16.
Dwyer verified that the Jayants had intercepted the initiative in the first break when he scored a second goal for the night at the end of the first period.
The owner regrouped, and Bushar scored again, scoring a goal with a numerical overweight at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give "Dandy" the chance to take the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, after which he and his team secured the victory by keeping their opponents in the middle of the field until the end of the period.
The Jayants, who have currently lost four of the last five matches, are heading to Milton Keynes for the next match, which will be held on Friday.
Airplane Controller Died to Allow Hundreds of People Aboard the Airplane to Avoid Earthquakes
The Indonesian air controller was posthumously awarded the title of a hero after he consciously went to death in order for the plane with hundreds of passengers to take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been reported missing as a result of the severe earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which caused the tsunami.
Strong underground pushes continue to destroy the area, many of the inhabitants of the city of Palu were under the rubble of buildings.
Despite the fact that his colleagues escaped to save his life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the horrifying control elevation of Mutiar Sis Al-Gufri Airport in the city of Palu.
He remained in his place to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the landing track at the time, was able to take off safely.
Then, when it seemed to him that the tip was crashing, he jumped out of it.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian news agency ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to deliver it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the driver died before the helicopter was able to sit in Palu.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll from the quake could reach thousands, as according to the Natural Disaster Reduction Agency, access to the cities of Donggala, Siga and Butong is limited.
“The number of casualties is likely to increase as a large number of people are still under wreckage, and many have never been able to get out of there,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The six-metre-high waves devastated the city of Palu, in which the mass burial of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says Sky News: “Emergency brings victims every minute.
Clean water is lacking.
Mini-markets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross staff are already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know they will stop there.
The tragedy has already taken quite a serious scale, but it can be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and spoke to the country’s armed forces, in particular, saying, “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by the Lombok earthquake, which killed more than 550 people.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that one person has disappeared without news after plane crash in lagoon
The airline carrying out the crash in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now reports that one person has gone missing, while it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew safely left the crashing plane.
According to Air Niugini, as of Saturday afternoon, she does not have any information about a single male passenger.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline was unable to immediately respond to requests to provide more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and crew of the plane after it crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, and all of them are in stable condition.
The causes of the plane crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed in the lagoon near the landing track.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft was not able to land on the landing track.
American passenger Bill Janes says that the plane began to enter the take-off and landing track too low.
“That’s very good,” Janes added.
Janes said he and other passengers had been able to go to the emergency exits on a sinking plane because the water level was in the belt.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming on board, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors who repaired the nearby yacht also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat on which they carried people to shore before the plane sank underwater about 30 meters (100 feet).
The flight safety networks show that over the past two decades, 111 people have been killed in airplane crashes of PNG-registered airlines, but none of these crashes were related to Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst was able to prove the fact of the burning of a woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecution launched a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulette gave multi-hour testimony as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the department members how he used cell phone records to compile an overall picture of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulette said he had received data on the location of these people from several mobile phones; according to the data, Tellis spent time with Chambers that evening, which contradicts his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reports.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the data obtained his mobile phone was near Chambers; when the circumstances were discovered, the police questioned Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford said that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said it was “a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
However, according to the records of the phone calls, they were called for only one week.
Roulette also showed that shortly after her death, Chambers Tallis removed her text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale says.
The defense should begin to put out its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is ‘conscious hip-hop’?
The hip-hop trio is going to fight a negative attitude towards this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed group from Bristol argues that the content of hip hop has changed, leaving the original political and social problems behind.
Members of the group want to go back to their roots and make “conscious” hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York nurse sued a couple for racist texting
A New York nurse sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from a woman complaining that the nurse was "another black woman" that the woman mistakenly sent the nurse instead of her husband.
The spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the claim was filed with the “purpose of extortion.”
Lensy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she came to the family on her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEET, ONLY THIS, ONE ONE ONCE BLACK,” Ms. Plasco-Flexman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of texting her husband, she mistakenly sent him twice by Miss Morris.
Recognizing her awkwardness, the “confused” Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, saying in the service that the nurse, who turned out to be African-American, was doing her job badly, and in general that they were expecting a Filipina, not an African-American.
Morris was paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing for a family couple and demands compensation for the <0x24>350 a day for six months — under the terms of the original oral arrangement, which, however, were not fixed by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable,” she told The Post on Friday, adding: “And I know it’s discrimination.”
The spouses disagree with the accusation of racism, and claim that the dismissal of Morris could be considered a reasonable step since, by insulting her, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t really mean.
She's not racist.
We’re not racists,” Joe Plasco told the Post.
“But would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if you were rude, not wanting it yourself?
Would you trust your newborn baby?
Let it go for you!”
Calling the lawsuit “extortion,” Plasco said that his wife gave birth to a child just two months ago and found herself in a “very difficult situation”.
“And are you ready to pursue a man who is in such a position?
It’s not very nice on your part,” added a bank worker who specializes in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but the public opinion has already handed its verdict on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behavior and problems with logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not understand the course with a speaking bear, a new letter says
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankee, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, responded by saying, “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the work for the first time, even before it was published.
It’s very fun to know that Paddington has been a huge success.”
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children's book about the bear, worked as an operator on the BBC, and would refer to the refusal to publish with optimism, and also added that the 60th anniversary of the release of his book was not a year of theirs.
As for Paddington’s own bear, she refers to him as a “very important member of our family,” and that her father was silently proud that his character eventually gained fame.
“He was a quiet and humble man,” said his daughter.
Paddington was so real to him, and to his father it was almost as if his own child had achieved success: he was proud of them, even though he did not actually consider that success his own merit.
I think that's exactly how he treated Paddington's success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear himself.”
I was forced to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was taken to the Nizza Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“I called on the phone regularly and said that everything was really bad, that something went wrong,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa.
“Then he called again and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that we should say goodbye.
I've done it.
I said, "Dad, I love you so much, darling.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually ceased to work, leaving her body.
She died sooner than expected.
I had to just sit and wait, knowing that everything was coming to an end.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself firmly in my hands.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa, sad about the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers, humiliated by the huge loss she had just suffered.
“Nobody around knew what had happened,” she said.
“My head shook, I didn’t stop crying.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this all-encompassing feeling of compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her.”
Women who survived the loss of loved ones prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women, who lost loved ones who committed suicide, are trying to prevent others from taking this step.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey place on the Welsh Bridge postcards with comforting words and phone numbers that people can call for support.
The son of Mrs. Davis Tyler was 13 years old when he began his depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to experience the same things I do every day,” she says.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Leeds, says her son was a great cook and had a damn charming smile.
“Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiles, the lights in the room are on.”
But before he died, he left his job because he had been through really terrible times.”
This happened in 2014, and the suicide Tyler found his brother, who was 11 years old at the time.
Mrs. Davis says, “I’m not going to stop fearing that a chain reaction will go away.”
Mrs. Davis invented these postcards, "so that people knew there was someone to whom you could address and tell everything, even if it was your friend.
You can’t sit down and shut up, you have to talk to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, with whom she had lived for 15 years — he did not become him shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, upset or something like that,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was particularly bad at Christmas: he didn’t even look at the kids when they opened their gifts.”
She says his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through it, this event has shocked our family.
It broke it in pieces.
But we have to keep living and fighting.”

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh hangs on her hair: FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for — an investigation limited in time and volume, we could bring at least a little bit of unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would “break up” in the background.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their fluctuations.
The interim elections will take place in just five weeks, November 6, and if — as expected — everything goes wrong for the Republicans, then they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the person they want and elect him to the post of supreme judge.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House since then on Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI publishes its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes at the Senate sitting, which would allow Vice President Mike Pens to resolve the issue of equal votes and confirm his nomination for the position of Supreme Judge.
The number of North Korean refugees has decreased by Kim
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined, the South Korean legislature said.
Pak Beon Seung, referring to data from the southern ministry, said that compared to the 2,706 cases recorded in 2011, this figure fell to 1,127 last year.
Mr. Pak said that the key factors were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates charged by smugglers exporting people.
Pyongyang does not make public comments.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the securely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants, not as refugees, and often subjects them to forced repatriation.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still in a state of war, have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume talks on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, at which they reached common agreements on disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ree Yun Ho, accused the United States of obstructing progress with its sanctions.
“If we don’t have at least the slightest confidence in the United States, we won’t have the confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be able to start disarmament unilaterally,” Mr. Ree said in a speech to the UN General Assembly.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavano "hysterical" and claims that he is unsuitable for work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the supreme judge, “hysterical” and said he was unsuitable for a job in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help thinking that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave like this, she would immediately be called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony at the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blaise Ford’s accusations of sexual harassment that allegedly took place when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was quite emotional, sometimes even screaming and breathing, telling about his family and school years.
He also unambiguously condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and clearly planned assassination of an active figure” organized by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton losing the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her opinion, by her own testimony, Kavanaugh only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as he had a foreseeable attitude towards the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his claims, as well as with how he sneaks on the Clintons and Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to justice if his guilt was confirmed and if the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not only suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he is in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions regarding the Affordable Medical Care Act or “Row vs. Wade” as he is considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Kavanaugh circumvented the question of whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“This is not the time to leave a hysterical and preconceived man in the position of a supreme judge and at the same time to shout, ‘How great!’” Pelosi said.
And women have to own it.
It's just anger, months and years of anger, it can't go through it without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” said Ms. Steinem 45 later.
“I don’t think it’s as unusual as you think?”
She continued: “A woman who worked somewhere in a managerial position helped me a lot. She told me she was crying when she was angry too, but she developed a technique that she explained to her interlocutor: “You can think I’m crying because I’m upset.
Actually, I’m angry.”
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed by this approach.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger, in part because they are misinterpreted at the root.
One of my most painful memories of the first job in the office, where men dominated me: I once cried out of anger, but I was caught by an old woman, a soulless manager, whom I was always terribly afraid, and whispered to the bed.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re crying out for anger.
They think you're upset, and they're happy to think they've finally brought you in."
Patricia Schröder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught on some serious intrigue and left the race, Mrs. Schröder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason for her to run for president.
“This decision was not properly thought out,” she confessed to me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race at the time, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case "The Snow White and the Seven Gnomes."
The campaign was already coming to an end, she was very late in fundraising, and so she swore that she would not participate in the race if she didn’t raise <0x24>2 million.
It seemed to be a completely losing option.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated <0x24>1,000 to men, offered her only 250.
“What am I for them, precious commodity, huh?” she wondered.
When she made a speech announcing that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was so engrossed in emotions — thanks to the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so hard to raise money and access voters, as well as anger over discrimination.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schröder recalled how the press reacted to her.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still wondering, what would they write on my memorial?
“She was crying without end?”
How Trade War With America Could Be Useful to Beijing
Experts believe that the first halls of the trade war between the United States and China were dazzling, and while the battle is still far from over, the split between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese export goods, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs affected goods worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), actually taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has every time applied equivalent retaliatory strikes, recently setting tariffs on U.S. goods of <0x24>60 billion, ranging from five to ten percent.
China has promised that retaliatory measures against the US will be equal each time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to begin to experience at least the slightest difficulties in the near future.
Forcing Washington to step down means giving up demands, but giving up the U.S. publicly would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing is able to play its cards correctly, the pressure of the U.S. trade war could provide long-term support to China, decreasing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to economic turmoil in any of these countries is actually much more dangerous than previously acknowledged by observers,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the American Security Center.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is “Ready” For Returning Refugees
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and is calling for help in restoring a country that has been devastated by the war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and safe thanks to the successes in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live peacefully there.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave due to terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives, have now been created.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for its assistance in restoring the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country will not accept assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe confirms victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rider Cup, winning the U.S. team with a score of 16.5–10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six times in a row on European soil, and the European Riders Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe has regained the crown thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who has scored 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who has been struggling for much of the tournament, made his first long-distance water kick on the 16th round of Par-3, giving up his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming the 1st-4 player who ever went 5-0-0, as the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spite was defeated by a 5:4 player with the lowest score in the European team, Turbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Justin Johnson, surrendered 2-1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup last time.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, became the winner of the tournament in all of Europe's history with 25.5 points for his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t stand it today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy to get the cup again.
It’s all about the team, and I’m happy that I was able to help,” said emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Rame, who on Sunday won over American golf legend Tiger Woods with a 2:1 score in a single game.
“I’m extremely proud of this victory – I grew up watching Tiger Woods play,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These scores are quite odd for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, yielding only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought for all weekends, vainly trying to succeed. The exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finaw, who showed the highest-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick said, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we were able to get a little bit of Europe.
It didn't work.
We're taking off our hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played excellently.
We will regroup, I will work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward in success.
I love all the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to know how to lose.
We've lost."
Red tide: news Concentration of microorganisms decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reflects the overall decline in red tide concentrations in some parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, in areas of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Colorado counties there is reported abundant flowering, indicating a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red Wave extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from the north of Pinell to the south of Lee County.
The spots can be observed about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsboro County, but compared to last week, their number has decreased significantly.
A red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations in and near Pinellas County were reported, from low to high concentrations in the coastal area of Hillsboro County, high concentrations in the counties of Manata and Sarasota, and concentrations in the coastal areas of Lia and high concentrations in the district.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Colorado, there is still a possibility of irritation of the respiratory tract.
In northwestern Florida, no such probability was reported last week.
