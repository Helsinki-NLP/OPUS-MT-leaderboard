Didn't he understand that a lot?
Is there a lot of truth to this?
Is this the key to your life?
Is this the first time you've ever heard of it?
Is that the key you're looking for?
It's Tom's story, isn't it?

I'm a Frenchman.
I'm going.
I've been reading the story.
I've learned the Kurdish language.
I love the language because it's a language I love.
I love the language because it's a language I love.
I'm working.
I'm going to say that that's not true.
I hope it's a dream.
I've lived my life.
I thought it was Tom and Mary.
Tom and Mary ate together.
I've seen Tom and Mary.
I thought it was Tom.
I've been told by Tom.
It's good to know that if we're going to get back in the dark, we're going to have to get back in the dark!
I'm going to make the right decision!
Do you think it's a new one?
I'm worried about my body.
I'll take his place.
It's like you know you're going to do this.
I've had a lot of trouble with this.
I've had a lot of experience with this.
We've been told that we don't have a world.
I'm starting to think about it.
He said what.
Some of you will follow their own paths, and others will follow their own paths, so that they will not be able to escape.

He didn't listen to me.
I'm the one in you!

That's what religion does.
It hasn't been so long since that meeting.
I'm going to put my hair in the first place.
I'm going to eat your food.
I think it's alive.
I thought I'd want to do that.
I've heard a lot of noises coming from the back of the house.
I thought there was someone who opened the door.
I thought there was a door to the door.
I think I've heard something.
There's something I've heard.
It's time to start with a book.
He's going to call me.
I hope you're enjoying this book.
I'm going to live.
"I've got everything," Tom said, "I don't want to be angry."
I've been reading my books.

I'm assuming that Mass Jackson is a great teacher.
I'll tell you about it day and night.
That's what I believe.
I've just finished it.
I thought it was a good place.
I thought it was a good one.
I thought it was a good thing.
God has given me this man where I have seen him.
I saw it was a problem.
I saw that the problem was going to be solved.
I'm assuming that Mass Jackson is a teacher.
I don't think it's true.
I thought it wasn't true.
I went to the house where he was sitting, and I saw him.

I thought that we could do it.
I believe it and I know it.
I'm tired and I'm crying.
I thought there was one in the back room.
I thought he was sitting in the back of the room.
I thought there was someone in the back room.
I'm sure there's a guy in the back room.
But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.
For God's sake, there are four living beings in the house.
There were a few of them.
I went to the house where he was sitting, and I saw him.
I'm going to take that Tom.
I don't think it's French every day.
I don't think he speaks French every day.
I've only seen this one time.

Tom's got it.
I'm going to take Tom.
I'm pretty sure Tom's a big fan of me.
I thought Tom was dead.
I thought Tom was dead.
There's something to be said about Tom.
I thought Tom was dead.
I think he's going to have to change his mind.

I'm sure you did it as you wish.
I'm sure you'll do it if you don't.
Wait a minute, you've been eating!
I hope you'll come back to us.
I'm going to protect you.
I'm hoping he will come.
The message will come.

I'm going to take Tom.
I told him you'd love him.
I thought it was Tom who did it.
I thought we were friends.
I just wanted to stay with Tom.
I don't think you can't sleep.

I'm looking forward to the job.
I told him you'd love him.
I'm very pleased with you.
It's good!
That's the way we go.
Now it's time to leave.
Wrong!
I'm sorry you can't come.
It's a little boy.
It's a little boy.
You're in the right place.
There is a gap between the right and the left.
For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of their infirmity in the sight of the Lord.
Don't use the cards.
The one who knows it will give it to those who know it.
Let me write to you.
I was the one who died.
I'll tell you if I see you again.
It's not in our hands.
That's not the man!
I don't want to say anything.
It's not just a sign of peace.
We need to know what we're talking about and what we're talking about.
Maybe I'll get my books.
We'll be back later.
He's got a glimpse of it.
The wind has come back.
It's a leak.
You're the youngest person in the world.
It's a good day today.
He's very happy today.
We want to help those who are in need.
"It's the best language in the world, and it's the best for you," he said.

You're going to call it an apocalypse.
It seems like he's still alive.
It seemed like we had to do it.
You feel like you're the one you're looking for.
You don't have all of them.
As a result, there is a school where you can get a scholarship.
He's got a fire in the night.
You can tell the truth.
He's got a head on the id.
That's what needs to be done.
That's what needs to be done.
I told them they didn't tell me.
I told them that they didn't tell you.

I told him he'd have to go back to the day.
I told him I wouldn't go back to the hospital with him.
I told him where I wanted to go.
I told him what I was going to do at the restaurant.
I told him I wasn't there.

I live in France in the United States.
I've made my own.
I was in Boston on the 20th of October.
I want to see it, too.

I'm a warrior.
I believe in him.
I've been crying.
It's a real life.
It's very nice to hear.
That's the book.
It's the end of the action.

That's a dilemma.
It's close to my house.
You've got a lot in your mind.
It's a long way off.
That's what they said.
Killed.
He's dead.
Yes, that's it.
I'll tell you.
She knew that Mary was doing it.
He likes the baby today.

It's my family.
It's my job to do it.
It's my turn to talk.
His name's Tom.
I am with you now, and I am hoping to come to you in a short time!
It's not a business.
It's not a problem for everyone.
It's not all bad!
This isn't the case because it requires a lot of energy.
I don't think anyone would say I'm gay.
It's not a tuber.
Don't play.
It doesn't have any meaning.
That's not my job.
It's time to tell you about your problems.
It's time to tell you about your problems.

It's lovely!
He's very good!
He won't be sick.
We've got it at the end.
Don't stop, don't stop.
He's still loved.
He still loves it.
It's the 20th day.
This is their last one.
You're screwed!

Mary and Tom wanted to see her.
It was Mary who wanted to live.
He stopped the door.
It's a lie.
You don't have to be such an asshole, sweetheart!
You've got a problem, you've got a problem, you've got a problem, girl!

He's doing it.
It's their tactics.
It's going to be light.
