China strongly opposes U.S. adoption of “Taibei Bill”
China strongly opposes the U.S. adoption of the so-called "Taibei Bill", which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of three Chinese-American joint communicators.
This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the State Council of China Office for Taiwan Affairs Ma Xiaoguan.
The approval by the U.S. Senate Committee on International Relations of this bill is also a serious violation of international law and fundamental principles of international relations and a gross interference in China’s internal affairs, Ma Xiaoguan said.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and related issues are related to China’s internal affairs.
“We call on the American side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering with the Taiwanese issue in order to avoid further damage,” Taj Mahal said.
China needs to be and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or any forces, Ma Xiaoguan stressed.
TikTok hides unpleasant videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.
Imagine China/Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok is subject to censorship of videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the forbidden religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian reports.
The documents found at the publications say that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) is promoting China’s foreign policy goals overseas through the app.
The main part of China’s policy violations is under the “hate spark”.
In each case, TikTok places inappropriate publications in a context that is appropriate under general rules so that the actions of the social network do not appear to be censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of China’s socialist system falls under a general ban on “criticism or attacks on any country’s policies and social rules, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”
The ban on the mention of incidents on the Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under the “history of China or other countries.”
The document also includes a list of the banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or state figures", including North Korean leaders Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sen and Kim Chen Yin, Indian politician President Preyano, President Obama, President Obama, President Obama, President Donald Trump, President Donald Trump and President Obama.
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Posts from the first category are removed by social network administrators and can result in the user being blocked.
Not too strict violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok algorithms.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applicable: “We are now using a localized approach to moderation, and we are also attracting independent local experts.”
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, says co-founder of the “Producer Center” Rustem Bogdanov.
"Producer Center" is one of the Russian media companies, which officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the advertising materials of the bloggers "Producer Center" agrees with the representatives of the social network, but the user material can be posted without consent, Bogdanov transmits.
Asked whether TikTok could speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answered affirmatively and said he had seen such publications.
Bogdanov agrees with the founder of the agency Our Diddigital Roman Zaripov: “The basic rules for users TikTok lists in the user agreement: it is not possible to expose shocking content, discriminatory statements and so on.”
But under these rules you can summarize any content that does not like moderators, Zarypov notes.
Zaripova is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.
According to the User Agreement, only persons over the age of 13 may use TikTok.
Social network administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: the neuronet analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the neuronet decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.

Russians warn of fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters who replace the bank’s phone number has increased.
This is reported by the Kommersant with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator transmitted information about more than 2.5 thousand numbers to customers of various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, the operators found a replacement of the number.
Another 218 rooms were blocked, and in 59 cases, restrictions were imposed on the use of financial services.
Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the Central Bank Artem Sychev said that the replacement of the number was encountered by a wide range of Russian banks.
He explained that operators do not always respond to the Central Bank’s warnings about fraudulent calls, referring to the lack of such an obligation in the “On Communications” law.
In the bank "Open", Rosbank and Alpha-bank confirmed information about the increase in the number of fraudulent calls with the replacement of the number.
As reported in the press service "Bilina", part of the information about the fraudulent calls sent by the central bank was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Blocking them would lead to failures in the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudsters’ numbers, which the telecommunications operator will contact at each call to check the number.
He explained that the establishment of such a base would require amendments to the legislation.

In Crimea offered Zelensky alternative course in NATO
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, instead of the course for joining NATO, should be engaged in establishing good neighbourly relations with Russia.
This was reported on Friday, September 27, by the co-chair of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Chegrinets.
“The President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of the predecessor, but should listen to the advice of [US President] Donald Trump, which he listened with a sour face, and set up relations with the President of Russia,” Chegrinets told reporters.
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will only be able to remain in power if relations with the Russian Federation are established.
Earlier on September 27, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he had held talks with Zelensky on the country's accession to the alliance.

"Barcelona" blackmails Neymar
The Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to settle the financial dispute that has arisen since the move to the French Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost came to court, but the Catalans offered the player to settle the dispute without the intervention of the Femida.
Otherwise, they refuse to return to him.
Neymar and his smart father, who is also a Brazilian agent, attracted an interesting focus: according to the deal with Barça, which the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>40 million.
However, literally a year later, the forward was in the "PSG" for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to pick up the remaining 18.
Brazil’s lawyers insist that the club also owes him interest on late payment.
When the capital of Catalonia became known about Neymar’s claims, Barcelona filed a lawsuit.
Blue-granets insist that the bonus was assumed for the execution of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player had only a quarter of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>40 million and demands a refund of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Neymar and the Barça almost agreed to return the "slut" player to the Catalan stool.
True, the deal has collapsed, but the hope for the forward's reversal remains.
And here, according to Sports.Ru, referring to insiders, the club’s lawyers told the player’s representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in a pre-trial manner, it will exclude the possibility of returning the Brazilian.
Neymar himself wants to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans would redeem him.

But Laar replied that the Party's goal was to get two seats on the board of the Bank of Estonia - so that in addition to Yaanus Tamkivi, Andrés Sutt would also be included in the board.
On Tuesday, September 24, Reikikogu rejected Laar's proposal to appoint new members of the Estonian Bank's Board of Directors.

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend the cart found in a garbage dog
A resident of the U.S. city of Auckland Park, Florida, has been arrested on charges of attempted murder after being struck by a samurai sword on his opponent in a dispute over a wagon found in the garbage.
54-year-old Curtis Miller digs into a pile of garbage near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers who went on an evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black truck among the waste.
Miller saw Bivers's discovery and was upset.
He thought he could claim a truck, as the first one started digging in the garbage.
The men began to argue.
All of a sudden, Bivers grabbed the cart and ran with her towards his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he had found in the same dog and started chasing the opponent.
He got Bivers around his house.
Miller took the sword out of the knife and began to swing them in the direction of the truck kidnapper.
Bivers told Miller that what was going on was being recorded on the video.
Seeing the camera, Miller ran away, but threatened to return.
Beaver left the cart in the yard and went into the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw an unknown woman entering the courtyard and taking the cart, yelling insults.
Police have already searched for Miller for driving a car without a license.
The man was arrested and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the U.S. city of Hardystone, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked an unknown woman and wounded her with a sword.

Mass Unrest on the Three
The “Moscow case” against the participants of the summer protests, the further, the more noticeable it breaks down into separate fragments and loses political filling.
Evidence of the fact of the "mass riots" itself does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to put this case on hold, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of charges.
The collapse of the case should inspire society, but it will certainly leave in the extreme irritation of the policemen, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under article 212 of the UK (mass riots) - Alexei Minaylo was suddenly released from custody without any obligations, and later he was imprisoned: several more hours and in prison.
He was arrested for almost two months, and several professional communities joined him at once: historians, priests, literaries.
After that, only two of the accused in the mass riots (originally there were 13): Sergei Fomin, transferred to home arrest on 3 September, and Samariddin Rajabov, who was prosecuted on the eve of the trial, also extended the arrest until the end of December (31 December).

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens has been studied poorly.
One of the most famous is pineapple pollen.
But phytoestrogens are studied well and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including cardiovascular, some types of cancer).
Known sources of phytoestrogens - all beans (the most popular - soybeans), hops, linseeds.
However, many experts believe that such BADs cannot be a full substitute for natural hormones.
It is also not possible to exclude possible damage from such additives.
For example, in the background of their intake, the production of their own hormones may be reduced due to the fact that too many analogues come into the body from the outside.

He has a lot of history and great fans.
I wish them all the best and I believe that the city authorities will return their home club!” – Veretennikov wrote on Instagram.

The Hydrometer Center Names True Folk Signs
In Russia, there are many folk signs that people are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometer Center checked all the signs that are supposed to work.
Meteorologists have come to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, indeed, in the short term.
As the head of Russia’s Hydrometer Center, Roman Wilfand, said, if the sun is red during the sunset, then the next day will really be awkward, as our ancestors noted.
If the sky is white, it will rain the next day.
The second working note is based on observation of birds.
They are more often spoken of assholes, if they fly low, it is usually raining.
This is explained simply - when the humidity of the air is high, men wet their wings and feathers are forced to decrease to hunt for insects, writes TASS.
On different continents, there are folk signs.
Surka Day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day it is necessary to observe the surka coming out of its nest to determine the time of spring.
Unidentified oil spots found on beaches in northeastern Brazil
Oil spots of unknown origin have been discovered on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
Pollution sites were scattered over two thousand kilometres of coastline.
Reports of the first oil spots discovered began to occur on the second of September.
However, with each day until Thursday, their number, as well as their territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Environmental Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turns out they are all the same and it’s about crude oil.
The state-owned oil corporation Petrobras, to which the samples were transferred for analysis, said they did not correspond to the oil from the Brazilian lands.
"It's a thick oil.
It can be discarded from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it has fallen into the ocean current," Brazilian news portal G1 coordinator of the union of oil workers of the states of Pernambuco and Paraíba, Rogerio Almeida, said.
He also added that, despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to discard waste in the open sea.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected northeastern states of the country, environmentalists have discovered nine sea turtles completely covered with oil film.
Only two of them were able to be saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environmental Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin to clean up polluted beaches.
Meanwhile, specialists of the institute recommend to tourists and locals to circumvent the oil spots and notify of all detected contamination sites.

Russians have no reason to postpone their retirement - V. Matvienko
Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have enough accumulations to make a full-fledged bill on a guaranteed pension product in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions due to personal accumulations in the world is quite common.
The other thing is how timely it was introduced to us.
“In my view, a significant part of the population now has incomes, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increasing pension security in the future,” Matvienko said.
Russians, according to the spokesman, cannot understand the mechanisms for the formation and apportionment of pensions, because "constant changes in this area have finally confused them".
That does not mean that I am against the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we are obliged to do everything in our power to improve the size of pensions and the social security of citizens.
But the steps in this direction must be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account the domestic realities,” Matvienko said.
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on guaranteed pension products) is to be developed, several basic principles must be provided for, including voluntary, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict state guarantees and guarantees.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that it would send a bill on the harmonisation of the guaranteed pension product (GPP).
Among its main elements are the exclusively voluntary procedure of accession of citizens to the system of accumulations, ensuring the preservation of long-term pension accumulations of citizens by the state, registration of accumulated accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax advantages for business and tax for citizens.

“It happened that he was the only superhero to have been in a variety of cinemas.
So as long as Sony continues to develop its own Speedy universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises,” he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five movies, apparently commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account an excerpt from the film "Wolf with Wall Street" in which the hero Leonardo di Caprio shouted "I don't want to!"
Information on the conflicts between the companies appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to receive half the cash revenue from Spider-Man movies, provided both companies would pay half the cost of producing the paintings.
But that didn’t work for Sony.
The news of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel movie world has provoked anger among many loyal fans.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.

We’re happy to be able to move forward together.”

Expert explains why you should refrain from tea in bags
A team of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that when welding a tea bag in a cup of tea in five minutes, more than ten billion microplastic particles fall.
The packaged drink can also be added to the opioid particles, said Nation News food safety expert Elizabeth Tikhonov.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information about the composition of packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be indicated on the packaging.
The seedlings are not discarded at the end of the season, so they may be in tea.
“Moreover, the bags do not always include tea plants,” Tikhonov said.
According to her, it is better to refrain from drinking such a drink in favor of tea on a parsley, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea is not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - the microparticles are heated to high temperatures, due to which they can begin to secrete harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - in such a drink will be the least additives," the expert said.

Regions are invited to share the secrets of business support
As the "Parliamentary Gazette" became known, on September 27, the Chairman of the Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy Andrei Kutepov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with the proposal of the Ministry of Finance to express a position on the initiatives of the Subjects of the Federation.
It is time to establish inter-regional relations
The Economic Policy Committee of the Council of the Federation summarized information received from the regions on current business development and self-employed legalization programmes, as well as on the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions spoke to the senators about the problems of SME development and submitted proposals for improvement of the current legislation.
"To date, communication between regions is insufficient, as a result of which the entrepreneurial community in all regions visited by the senators was referred to the issue of the lack of information on the regional development programs of entrepreneurship across the country," - Andrey Kutepov noted.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a summary of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and aggregate data from the regions with proposals and issues (available under the editorial).
In addition to the profile ministries, aggregate data from the regions are also sent to the heads of the regional executive authorities.
The exchange of information on positively implemented developments in the regions could boost the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step to such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” the senator said.
Useful experiences
Today, in many regions of the country, support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises have been adopted and successfully implemented.

In the Ivanovo region, a system of business support has been developed, which provides for the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.

In a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to get out of the shadows
According to the regional authorities, a number of amendments to the current legislation should be made in order to provide more effective support to small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region has proposed replacing the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity", as it "mostly corresponds to the content of the public service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens".
In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to amend the list of activities carried out by self-employed citizens, including the activities of refurbishment and repair of residential premises, residential buildings, physical training courses.
Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen the control of unfaithful dairy producers with the help of the veterinary system "Mercury".
And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions advocate the consolidation in the legal field of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the directions of support for social entrepreneurship.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills," - said Andrei Kutepov.

Thus, those who do not want to fly next to the babies due to the possible inconvenience associated with their crying may be as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the services of the airline have come to be enthusiastic about innovation.
Some of them thanked the airline, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the users complained that a few weeks ago he had made a flight from New York to Doha, and three crying children were sitting next to him.
Another commentator proposed to introduce "adult-only flights", expressing the willingness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists have noted that now they will always try to choose for their moves, as they see nothing pleasant in flying next to a crying child in an indoor space.

It is about the supply of goods that have not fallen under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the decline in import-prohibited products was offset by an increase in imports from CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia and Serbia.
At the end of August, the government extended until 31 December 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs, which are prohibited from importing into Russia under counter-sanctions.
The document, posted on the official legal information portal, noted that the rules have been extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the sanctions were imposed on products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, since August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and since January 1, 2016 - Ukraine have "joined" this list.
Putin’s decree on the destruction of illegally imported “sanctions” (products covered by the food embargo that Moscow introduced in response to anti-Russian Western sanctions) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government has allowed to destroy “sanctional” food in any lawful way.
As the Western sanctions continued, the Russian Federation also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, the measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the importation of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation for the development of civil society and human rights Mikhail Fedotov previously called the destruction of food “just immoral”, and this, he said, negatively affects the education of people.
In addition, with the initiative to prohibit the destruction of foods suitable for consumption, Rospotrebnadzor spoke in early June.
After that, a similar recommendation was made to the Government by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
And the deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation Alexei Gordeev said that the destruction of food products is wrong, and it is necessary to think about how to use them as intended, assessing the quality.

Chile has started to build a telescope worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, construction of the dome has officially begun this week, where the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope) will be located, while the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project.
Its total cost, according to ESO, will exceed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion.
Much of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflective surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT get the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, as well as looking for Earth’s twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surrounding Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has only begun, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory have been developing scientists, engineers and other specialists for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, with a total value of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million, was awarded by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
