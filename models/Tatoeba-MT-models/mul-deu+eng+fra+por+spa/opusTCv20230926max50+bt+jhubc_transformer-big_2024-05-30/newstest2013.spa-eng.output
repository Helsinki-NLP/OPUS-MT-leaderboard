A Republican strategy to hinder Obama’s re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die from a lightning strike.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 electoral fraud cases in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: those new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In that sense, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line, a majority of U.S. governments passed new laws, starting in 2009, that made the process of enrollment or voting difficult.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw an increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011, 180 bills were introduced that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to a proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, those laws reduce the periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of scrutiny and withdraw their right to vote from citizens with criminal background.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photographed identity document.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
Therefore, the Republican authorities rushed to extend that practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photo ID.
It is important to note that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people aged to vote, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
As a result, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people who earn less than <0x24>35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18-29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, voters who vote most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no state required the citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to submit such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
Two out of three Hispanic voters seem to support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers endorsed certain laws in 2011 that abolished voter registration on the same day of scrutiny in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters who wish to enroll.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 have made the enrollment rate of new voters fall in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states that favored the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 Florida election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter accounted for only 13% of the state’s voters.
In the case of the Spaniards, the same thing happened.
These represent only 11% of voters, equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, which account for 76% of the electorate, represent only 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have vehemently opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It could, in part, limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states passed the law requiring the presentation of a photographed identity document.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that states that have passed such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative amendments to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: those new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, the measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Detection: Doing the Test or Not Doing It?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents false results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It’s more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant in themselves, doubt whether or not detection tests should be done.
Do the test or not?
We have asked for advice from two experts.
Studies conducted in the United States detected a high rate of contagion among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret those data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who did not.
The study, with a 12-year follow-up, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chances of metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer. You should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not care for long-term life, in which case you should rather opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since such cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest an active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you do the test in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine if you should take the test or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urology Society, a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone eats well and moves enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smokes, that rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms people’s health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The weight
Fat and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
Increases the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer,” they add.
The Nutrition
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large amounts, they escalate the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,” they explain.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their investigations are not conclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about the concerns and family history of each person with their doctor.
"Doing the detection test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, indeed, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that this is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference held in Kyoto seems to confirm that it is, although more data is still lacking to be completely safe.
Anyway, we assume that this is Higgs, since the chances of mistakes seem little. We will see what it is.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inevitable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and do not try too hard, because it will end up hurting itself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics in it: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" which consists, grossly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And on the other hand there are the Bosnians, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratories' website The Particle Adventure which, by the way, is extraordinary, the Bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we will not talk here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the bosson of some of Higgs's form is in parenthesis.
These bosons, I should point out here, are not the exotic beasts we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or "light particle" that acts as a "message" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that specific environment; a bit like when we throw a stone at a pond.
In this "disorder" a electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the bosons "bearers of force".
A more stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, that needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, it takes extremely high energies, a little bit as if it were an ice pond where only a thick rock could slide over the surface.
That’s why it takes an immense particle accelerator like CERN (the great hadron collisioner is a 27 km circumference ring!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don’t: a piece of paper, for example, will never stand on its own sticking to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what can all those investigations "contribute" to?" asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and predictions of MS.
For their part, many fervently wish to meet each other, as the slightest difference could open a door to a “new physics” that closes certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of such research in our day-to-day life are hard to predict, but we don’t think we’re mistaken in saying that it won’t have any.
For them to see: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser in laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would provoke.
They looked at the scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, the laser was initially considered rather a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagin...
In addition, applications can also proceed from all the instrumentation that surrounds research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light collector in 1969 in the course of his research on optics.
Although it was not at all its original intent, this pickup now serves as an “eye” for all digital devices in the world, which earned it the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That doesn’t mean, of course, that LHC’s activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but it’s never known...
Palliative care. The best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
In his Committee on Death in Dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon as a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still a lot to do.
Le Devoir has tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer he was destroying had given him a two-year breath.
“They had given me five years of life, but I already have seven,” says one of them, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for this,” he continues.
The disease has caused him damage: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Courageous, he even smiles, talks to strangers who pay attention to him, bring him medicines and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greatest desire is to cure my diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that evil.
“Over the course of our lives we learn that a man builds up his feet,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
Returning to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he notes.
Because, in the opinion of most people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer “cure” care.
The biggest fear of Ms. A., 89, is to die "consciously and drowned".
But the disease has caused her children to discover.
"I have good kids," he adds.
“I don’t have any more desires in this life,” she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, for a last visit from your child who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and nutrition assistance.
They are palliative care that is given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, as we all know we'll end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the center’s doctors.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouth rinsing with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics can no longer control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, her son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center of Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being the same.
Alongside a 94-year-old man who tastes his last family reunion in the yard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, having tried everything to survive.
“For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of age with cancer,” Dr. Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of their life, whether at home, hospital, or in a care center.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Grand Montréal home palliative care company, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that great relative shortage in Quebec’s healthcare that makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before they are accepted to proceed with euthanasia.
“Recently,” she relates, “I saw a patient spend 14 days in Emergencies suffering from great pain without having done what was necessary to relieve her.
I’m afraid patients just want to die because they don’t get the proper care.”
And in parallel, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helene Richard’s survival hopes were already low when she left a exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that she wanted to stop treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting,” she said.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who request to die thank their caregivers who have not met them in their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in terms of pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want them to relieve me.”
This reportage has been made possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from Canada’s health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers from political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which they are part of the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias.
A "industry" that became too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system pulverizes once we’ve hunted the big media,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
He led the outbreak of the 2011 scandal, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation into road contract-related misconduct in Quebec, which Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest had only agreed to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have saved <0x24>1 billion in contracts,” containing some of its instincts to stay with a proportionate share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, while hoping to be able to "demonstrate the existing stratagems behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government stakeholders, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of the Marteau Squadron, which, since 2009, have made Montreal’s sewer cartel moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has filed serial records of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of an outskirts city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Villancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts have been emboldened.
It has formally accused engineers from the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of procurement of public contracts.
He paid for three years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary that transferred the money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito allocated money to disgruntled and sinister during the 2000s, allocating more than <0x24>88,000 (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,000) to provincial parties, especially to liberals in power.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former deputy Liberal Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewage contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from construction companies for a total of <0x24>736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices between 30% and 40% in terms of fake extras.
In addition, the mayor’s party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately making the fat look at a parallel budget and filled his boxes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to ring the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has since 2010 opposed the sale of a <0x24>5 million municipal land acquired and resold for <0x24>1.6 million to promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of the money in election campaigns was dirty money
Of the research that will eventually be carried out, she says she pulls “a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and fish the culprits.”
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive".
We are cleaning the wounds but it would take a clean research unit in Montreal and be very careful so that dubious practices do not repeat.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but is concerned primarily about the role of “elected politicians in the current stratagem.”
Estimating at 70 percent the share of dirty money spent on funding election campaigns in Quebec, it is ironic: “I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to <0x24>100, but that will not change the donation, he said, “while election spending is not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics.”
It recommends a complete review of the system of public procurement and party financing: “We cannot fall lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with more solid foundations, with more controls and laws.”
If this story spoils the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would I explain that advancement?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Advance day by day to your side.
The technical staff has also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not hot.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine preforming centre to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed with a stirring pace.
It will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are accustomed to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti contributes a lot to my positioning.
It is backed by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course I do.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The trust you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think of PSG in the first half of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has removed us from our position of leader.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth in the finals with style.
What is the club’s goal in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
To begin with, we want to finish the first of our league against Porto to be able to receive the round of octaves of the final.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
For today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is given its means for that project to be realized.
Not winning the Cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in winning that championship.
Last season we didn’t get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we should have been champions.
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if great teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expect more from PSG?
It’s normal to expect a lot from us if we think about what’s been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home at Troyes, who still find themselves with things to blame is a little frustrating.
We wonder what people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to start a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, has not qualified for the eighth of the finals, and they have also invested a lot!
Given the amounts invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage per day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been “impulsed” by this new PSG.
That proves that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s successes.
It's better to say we have a "Zlatandependence."
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and has scored many goals.
He's here to prove he's a League 1 star.
And he has proven in all the teams he has gone through that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and I came out reinforced.
Today I can play good games in the team.
That’s what I expected from my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine, and this is because today we have an exemplary behavior.
What vision do you have of the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the blues?
You're getting results.
They are well placed in the World Cup qualifying group.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the Eurocup.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads the team to Brazil.
Did the emptiness (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve as a base?
That game gave us confidence.
Everybody fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
All the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
In addition, as is often the case in technology, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows file exchange equally.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
Bitcoin’s valuation, having peaked at <0x24>30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, fell to <0x24>2 five months later, before returning today to round the <0x24>10 ( quotes are censored on bitcoincharts.com).
It’s nothing impressive when we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "competiting with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as “credits”, used to advance in a video game and that can be won by playing or bought (and even sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time accounting book stores, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in the form of email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information connected to this transaction is electronically signed through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are contained in the public account book, which is spread throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file scraping, i.e., of transforming a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "trotting" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zero at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would remain orphaned, as both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the 100 millionth, leaving a broad margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its heights.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in deposit.
“The default used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibility of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, such as the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the “giant discounts” were launched.
“<0x24>30,000 was exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that currency, believes in the potential of this technology as well as in the transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come out cheaper.
The carrier, in addition, manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to provide them with an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to review hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to be imposed, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicted.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in case this currency succeeds.
We've left Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished mainly Afghan peasants, whom we have deemed terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even assisted by local insurgents, these will no longer be when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to the French credits, was done by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, monitored by the helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advances between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country was enveloped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Its takeover of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants surpassed by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old Mujahideen, the present government and the present Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making government lands to resell them as sunshine for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from a pair of huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have learned to take advantage of American generosity: capital leakage is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived in the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With around 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is avid of mobile phones. The TV and its Turkish brochures presenting a modern world have big fans all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of Western nations, but the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, by removing the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular due to the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, their country has depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has reestablished its services, no reservoirs have been repaired or important irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth was expanded.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take over them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavating the immense Buddhist site and remaining there as the province’s most important employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore their normal relations.
The French troops left on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, children's schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "gain hearts and spirits" and to accomplish the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a "civil and military actions" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small interlective work of local NGOs and numbered French NGOs.
Those works, greedy of local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cultivation surfaces.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in those valleys often located at more than 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civil assistance that will reach them directly.
A Constitution with Foreclosures in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
He surprised everyone on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given that Assembly two more months to finish his work.
And almost two years ago, Egypt used a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial bribes.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" and continues to "tray his word" and "piss the law".
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a measure to speed up the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy is causing devastation across the country.
Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor of him, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Given that that appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "Either vote my text or I keep the powers full", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in its vast majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they thought they could not make their views valid.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the voted articles have been unanimously.
The commentators, on the other hand, are gratified by the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so many members of the committee came to think that the Watch of the Constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 remains the same as in the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the principal source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals call it hypocritical and consider it to be nothing more than an advertising scam.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because “people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are also heightened by the fact that the next rector of the university would be much less moderate than the current.
“For now, there is no specific religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on that text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system,” explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms employed imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We are specifically referring to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to judge above all of this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms regarding the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Neither will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be banned, as human rights associations have requested.
These also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider libertarian.
The crime of blasphemy continues and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not included in the previous constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to go out on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state protested on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the world’s hummingbird and a sea of salmon
The Promised Land combines the majesticness of Bible truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptism stack" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus’ miracles: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking over the waters, the calming of the storm and the crowded nets.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers here travel the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin "Painful Way").
It begins at the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretorio, where the trial was held, and continues along the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Unction and the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Ombligo of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree of which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their desires, which will then become reality.
Making a Vertical Journey
The ruins of the Massada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who are dedicated to climbing can.
Others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermón, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
From the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, there were supposedly pagan gods at the top of the mountain.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
In a single trip you will not be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Manuscripts or Qumran Rolls, discovered in the desert caves of Judea, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his painting exhibition he has canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bathroom museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish bathrooms with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the exclusive private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free, and donations are not categorically accepted.
The fifth, the Museum of the Holocaust or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Healthcare
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall from 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and they bathe there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a salmon that easily hold up to those who don’t know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass courses of treatment with salt water, salmon and healing bars and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the Jaffa citadel, on the Mediterranean coast.
It passed through the famous sea route that unites Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, one can walk through the Roman theater, "to take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don’t worry if your English leaves much to wish for: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekels (currently <0x24>1-3.8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the High City.
Actually, it's an underground funicular.
Traveling in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by shuttle for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on the Sabbath.
From Friday night until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But on Sunday morning a new week of work begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes that combine milk and meat.
There is offered a wide selection of beef and lamb dishes, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, falafel, which are ground garbanzo balls, fruits and vegetables.
There are no street dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that “walk to their taste” imposingly.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the rooftops of the parked cars.
Snorkelers love the busy places and do not reject the treats.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost from <0x24>37 (Hyundai Getz) to <0x24>188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it comes out for <0x24>15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Admissions to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to visit the country and rested were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, amounting more than 51% to the same index in 2010, before the visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: Immigrants save for the language
While MPs and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of mandatory examination law, scammers have already appeared in the country trading “fake” certificates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
As of December 1, a law enters into force, according to which every working immigrant will have to take an exam to verify his Russian language skills.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector, community services institutions, domestic services and retail.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to pass the examination of the language, if not also that of Russian history and that of the foundations of the legislation.
Language knowledge must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens of countries where Russian is the official language are exceptions.
The persons who managed to obtain their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of exam centres will operate sponsored by the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of the Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to submit to the tests in all cities, now more than 160 such centers are open in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the exam was supported by the State Duma deputies and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for the Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
First, according to the Immigration Service representatives, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "working slavery".
Many people are talking today about the protection of the rights of labour migrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of your rights must be initiated prior to your departure.
Only an organized selection system will allow the problem of migrant workers to be solved in 90% of cases.
The problems are with unprofessional, educated immigrants, those who do not know the language or pass medical checks.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be sentenced to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, put a "paid trip" to a scary and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or paperwork.
We have received countless complaints from our immigrants.
“In their homeland they promise them one thing, but when they arrive they are deceased, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the wages they promised,” said Tolib Sharipov, head of the Tajikistan Immigration Service’s Labour Immigration Directorate.
Don't get angry, boss!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to go to, but also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tayikos can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families don’t even have anything to feed the children, not to mention dressing them, shoeing them and buying them what they need for school.
As they reach adolescence, these guys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if you do not know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the language law, rights advocates point to an important point.
The exams will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbid the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a fake registration can be made quickly and for only one thousand five hundred rubles.
The Russian police know that we usually carry fake documents, we are not registered, and cases of extortion appear.
“We are being asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea,” Umed Hushkadamov, a Tajik citizen, told reporters.
"Come on, don't be shy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was made clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be fake.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The counterfeit documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wishing to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise migrant workers that they would not have been able to successfully pass the exam for the first time ever to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian-speaking immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes that the law be applied more rigorously with respect to civilian arms owners.
This is the government’s reaction to recent incidents: Shooting during wedding celebrations where fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Shooting seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons, from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s security and anti-corruption committee, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the arms ownership law will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the “hard-hand policy”.
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social shooter organizations, demand that they give up such measures of "seriousness without meaning".
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov told the Russian BBC news service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012, there were 142 offences involving the use of firearms registered in internal organs, compared with a total of 1168 offences registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civil-use weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the criminal to turn to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior said that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons was under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black market for weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired colonel Víctor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High Major State.
Screenshot of the website that accepts arms orders
The first, the "military or military trace", is the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves,” Baranets says.
The following type of "black weapon", they are stolen by criminals and security forces representatives.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are proven versions that some fires were deliberately caused to cover the lack,” a former ex-military said.
According to Baranets, gun manufacturers also put their sand granite.
“They have now proliferated private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute under-string weapons to the black market, including that of Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There they have their own production, sometimes handicrafts, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons,” he explains.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these illegal arms supply sources in the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market’s weapons have arrived there “because of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of cases are stolen during arms production and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The drug addict from one of the gun stores, who asked for his surname not to be mentioned, says the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought for a long time because they are too old.
More often, it says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some means, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
“He takes the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers,” he tells us.
“But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan needs to be met, they make test purchases to illegal arms dealers,” the officer added.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through well-known ones.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who suggested me to go to the Begovaya platform, where I would be a man who would take me to a "skinita" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I’ll only learn there.”
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store employee. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
There are vendors in the markets, but you also have to get there, say, "on the part of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked him to tell him that his daughter had fallen a tooth."
I can even get a couple of steel handles through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I won't let him down.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets was put to the test in the role of an illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s, when he was willing to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
He was given a photo album where there was no "everything".
“I felt like in a luxury boutique,” the military recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered cat for lamb: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a blank.
“They give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure the weapon fires well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any documents or personal meetings.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the headline of the advert “Buy a gun or a machine gun.”
There the users make their orders and ask questions.
Do they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course", asks the user "Iván" (conserved spelling).
"Compre gun TT. Moscow", laconically formulating his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures in two hands those who want to buy firearms.
And the people go, like hungry fish to the bark, and then to extract coal in Siberia
Military and ex-military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send him a photo and instructions so he knows where the weapon is hidden,” NGO press secretary Dmitri Kislov said.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is made, one is left without a weapon and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures in two hands those who want to buy firearms.
“And people go, like hungry fish, to the bark, and then to extract coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for <0x24>100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from <0x24>100 to <0x24>900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Weapons", a Makarov gun can be purchased for <0x24>100-300.
You will have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from military warehouses by middle-class bosses.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, representing 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike.
Up to a quarter of American teens find their first jobs as cashier at McDonald's
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages paid in Walmart’s supermarkets and restaurants in popular fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For now, no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and dawn in its early stages.
The protests have the support of trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to increasing the modest wages perceived by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, protest organizers’ goal is to create workers’ unions in these companies.
So far, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
Actions began last week, after Thanksgiving Day, the so-called "Black Friday", that day in the United States began the orgy of discounts that captured millions of residents, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some employees of Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and formed protest pitches alongside unions and left-wing activists in the corporation’s stores, whose products are aimed at people with moderate and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That’s why many poorly paid Walmart workers only buy at work.
The availability and product range have made Walmart one of America’s largest corporations.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford the luxury of selling products at very low prices, in part because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of mountings or hand scanners.
That “Black Friday” protesters demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from <0x24>30 to <0x24>100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives <0x24>9.5 an hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average salary to <0x24>12 an hour, it will cost the corporation <0x24>3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than what you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on consumers’ shoulders, every visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of <0x24>12.39 more than they are spending now.
Walmart supporters commented with satisfaction that the protest took place in only nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The “Black Friday” was extended in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold around 5,000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview to the left-wing Huffington Post website that they left their jobs "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than "another public relations trick", organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not precisely the large Walmart warehouses (which in this progressive city are not appreciated, and therefore now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and then they don’t even give you the disease down and they don’t pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is <0x24>7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive <0x24>8.90 an hour in New York City.
No one wins less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers passed through the McDonald’s and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble on some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live off this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them with.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks start paying at least <0x24>15 an hour, i.e. doubling their current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of labor unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing union activists with arguments and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to encompass the fast food sector.
One of the main factors is the excessive rotation of staff.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day in other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the mitin at McDonald's located near Times Square, in which several local politicians participated, in particular Jumaae Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling you billions of portions of work," and then it doesn't pay you a hospital if you don't.
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, for example from Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that “we must support fast food workers so that they can receive fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.”
As described by the New York Times, this has been the biggest demonstration of its kind in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which they employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy."
The topic of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, has recently been normally perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Earlier this summer, Google demonstrated a moving model at its annual conference and later, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft’s Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, it was clear that for the company’s scientists, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted to the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general, what is the subject matter of your research group?
- We are dedicated to person-computer interaction, but we also try to broaden the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What's the future ahead of us?
Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information input has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We’re trying to change this, we’re working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
The world of computing must be liberated from our physics, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, fuck with those stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course, you cannot be considered a panacea, it remains to be resolved the question of privacy, since you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for controlling devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture <0x2B> voice.
- What's that like?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- That is, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we will have to work primarily on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, since they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Is it lack of resolution, depth or something else?
In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in depth.
From this last point of view, not all current technologies are good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond lab, made an adjustable processing delay contact sensor from 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects man-machine interaction.
For me it would be very useful for my work to have an equivalent of such a device, but it does not require contact to make the frames per second more.
- And you don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually the infrared transmitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible slider sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the cameras’ location curve and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
“As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding a smartphone in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (private things only you can see them), but also your weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark from the film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really oriented to bring tangibleness to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located gives a similar feeling to that one feels if someone was blowing it very much in the fingertips, but it is all tingling.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space think that he goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, who find many things in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "St. Petersburg vanguardism", dedicated to the citizens in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
On this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even Russia knowing them.
Rosbalt's new hero is extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above down, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophical storytellers from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s - early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens the inhabitants to smile and raises everyone in the mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organelle and became the organeller of St. Petersburg, having matured to play such a difficult role, due to his Bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going through the city dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, red color is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little grey causes aggression and agitation of properties nothing good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
When did you realize you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still incomprehensible.
I became a friend of the new wave artists, with the latter being exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I went to the theater for clothes, music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
- And all this came together in your art clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a Bohemian club, the Bohemian house in St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the phonogram, wore adjusted pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was the animator of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Clinic of Art.
That’s where our employees and customers went.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the poll was conducted in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination I was elected, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty, and culture of the last century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity go apart. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in which the present and the occurrence are clearly expressed.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Payasos."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like that is painful and scary.
But in the cliffs, everything is embedded and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by clothing, orienting himself on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And, maybe that person should not even give his hand, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
We just saw you in the role of urban organizing. - A cult city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be!
- Well, but, at best, can commercial art be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, touchy.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped into herds, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the simplists wanted the other.
Now everyone is divided into microcommunities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a <0x24>100 ticket to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, each cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov come for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And to a cultural event of 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything goes away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to lose what you have achieved.
When I was young, I made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end up.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money only to paint paintings.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is one concept: civil servant.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were right everything was different, the kings might not understand the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level to properly evaluate them and open their way.
It is now thriving subjective personal taste.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is ground.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is infinite.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a St. Petersburg grant.
Bringing Light to Space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board set off in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in pregnancies or on the same spare planet?
I think there is little where to choose.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problem of reproduction in space with the flora began to be addressed.
Half a century ago, experiments with plants were conducted.
Four generations of orbiting shrimp were no differentiated from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophiles.
In 1979, cod eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops under pregnancies.
As a result, we get a normal chicken.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that this bird has to find support, it has to stay on its own feet and start moving,” says Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
In finding no support, the polluters gave random turns.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
Pollutants did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
“And twice we managed to have the chickens born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them,” says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chickens in space.
The last time a biological "miniarca" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" will only travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
“This was precisely on biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had descendants.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instincts.
Humans, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
Women have been travelling in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our gaviota flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
“After all, no one has answered this question,” said Vakhtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the aerospace sector.
In June 1964, only after a year of space flight, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice orbited and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are counted to whom after long flights everything has gone well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," the cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov summarizes.
However, humanity must seek some new pathways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
In conditions of zero floatability, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
The water begins with infertility.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child is its birth element.
The little amphibian men seem to confirm that life on earth originated from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to water afterwards.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
“This is very little to forget about,” says Marina Aksenova, newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, for women it is necessary gravity, the force of gravity.
In pregnancy, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrease very quickly, the ability of the fetus to expel is reduced.
Well, we omit that, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth to a special camera, this will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear with a special training suit, like adults.
You will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead us to bring to Earth a disabled person, a completely unfit person,” predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of NK<0xC3><0x9A>: Inspection of the system "<0xC5><0xA0>varc" has not given with the guilty politician
With regard to public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is poor.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NK<0xC3><0x9A>) in an interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we are missing," so describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So, is it prohibited or allowed?
“The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the functioning of the office that is obliged to carry out such checks or demand obligations,” Kala notes.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German team, in which the legislation relating to public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started doing about two years ago.
In a simplified way: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, followed by the legislation in force in each country and then by the practice itself.
We have all joined together and, although the controls have not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. In general, the legislation of our country is "more strict and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly stringent rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What does this project actually contribute? What do you think are the conclusions?
It is precisely this kind of common control that could help us to stop investing in the concreteness of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
Savings economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable price (which doesn’t always mean the lowest price) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not because of the reduction of the award limits, it means that we are going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much “paper” that those who want to search for system failures can do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is it an office similar to our NK<0xC3><0x9A> or is it organized otherwise?
As for the offices, such as the NK<0xC3><0x9A>, there is the Bundesrechnungshof, with an organization similar to ours, with a college as well, the only thing is that in your case it is structured in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The jurisdictions are also somewhat analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the Courts of Auditors are even at this level. In this regard it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we here call state funds.
The public funds, which are managed by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are monitored by the Federal Court of Auditors.
In terms of local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to establish a comparison without concrete data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be precise what is best.
Could it be better, for example, with regard to the quality of the inspectors?
Of course not, but, I repeat, I don’t like to make such comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't, you wouldn't have any benefit to collaborate with our office, would you?
As far as the legislation of our country is concerned, what did the amendment of the Public Procurement Act mean for its Office?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been expressed in the control actions.
Since we carry out ex post checks, there is a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing for future controls: we have launched a new tool for "not-economic risk detection", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public procurements, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of the similar process are rectified.
Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, a bulwark for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that is the case.
The problem that can arise is that the legislation "resists" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already under the above regulations, controlled persons were bound by the contractor (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every law that was not respected in the field of public procurement meant a violation of the budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense, then, to harden the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal decision, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We’ll see where this initiated path leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDG would not bother employers with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system, with reference to the fact that it is autonomous only on paper.
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system banned or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the Prime Minister of the Government can prevent the functioning of the Office that is obliged to carry out such checks and demand obligations.
He may say, "We have changed the law and allowed it," but he cannot say that we will do as if nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, the legislation is quite strict as to the way in which it should act formally, and that is how it should be in order to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for failing to meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct, which is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice plates, although they are mostly transitable.
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads feature ice and snow plates.
Although most pathways are transitable, caution should be extreme in some.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but featured ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will fluctuate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in low areas the snow layer is thin.
On the slopes of the Metal Mountains, snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places the visibility was still poor due to the fog, according to information from the region’s road operations control center.
The R6 highway and first-class road in the region are now transitable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and slippery.
All second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also transitable.
However, in some of them there are still stretches with frozen ice and snow.
There is a need to increase attention on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, reports the Roads and Highways Direction on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger of ice sheets being formed, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Freezing can occur in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysokoho M<0xC3><0xBD>ta, and especially on second and third category roads.
Highways I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e and Orlick<0xC3><0xBD> mountains.
There is a layer of snow in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will be today between clear and partly cloudy, without precipitation.
The temperatures will usually range between three below zero and a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region are transitable today in the morning, although precautions will need to be extreme and it will need to be adapted to the time.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and subsequent temperature drops, some tracks may also be covered with ice.
In some places, drivers will find fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what comes out of the information from the region’s road operations control centre.
The D5 motorway is transitable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometres 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road bordering Germany there may be stretches with ice plates.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case, we also warn of ice sheet sections.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the less transited roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially unused snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>.
Road operators removed the snow during the night; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, according to the road managers.
In the rest of the region, most routes are transitable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, snow remains.
Drivers in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské will encounter half-waste snow in the direction of Jeseník," an operator of the road administration of <0xC5><0xA0>umper told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also visited Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks of the higher areas are now cleared and wet.
On the road of Olomouc the roads are transitable without restrictions, on the road of <0xC5><0xA0>ternberská the drivers should be cautious in the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Region of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Region of Liberec
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications on various stretches early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road. Instead, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the central Czech massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
As of now, no service complications have been recorded.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the surroundings of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day it is expected rain and snow to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
From the general roads, unfavourable conditions have been announced on the road I/13, on the border between the region of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the track with the weight of the snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world is coming, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of many other alarmist news stories that we like to catch.
The Tap Tap music group prefers to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you will organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state charitable event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar outlined for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20 at 9 p.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end approximately at the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to?
Initially it was my idea, then we went forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, along with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the world, canceled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can it be heard in beneficial concerts?
Of course, yes, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All performers will sing it at the same time in all three concerts.
The hymns will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, in addition to organizing many charitable events and concerts...
We put all our efforts into participating in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised in concerts against the end of the world be allocated to?
Equipment for the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we complete in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav.
Students from the school of Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they perform fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
In the framework of the completion of the works in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert there are several groups and interpreters.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is appealing to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform in Prague.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar “spectacular” action in the future?
In May we will perform at the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ské jaro festival for the first time, so here we will certainly prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I personally, taking advantage of being in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalistic, so far you have worked for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as hard as it might seem at first glance.
There are five members in the electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and also we carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have arranged them well. <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which is not surprising to me.
Even in Moscow, where we have just returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to exits abroad, you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the East, there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still uncommon for a person to move alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been established that seeks to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what respects should we take the example of advanced countries?
There are many aspects that we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people you directly affect.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to move on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever you want...
But it’s not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this regard, with The Tap Tap let’s move on a little bit!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers to emerge, it will really start to change everything.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a great willpower.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years ago, what led you to form the band in 1998?
I entered the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v institute as an educator, where there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among other things, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Lá<0xC4><0x91>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we got a little out of our hands (laughs).
However, popularity didn’t come until these last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us quite a lot by connecting with famous singers and also actively working to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can also afford to be a quality teacher, equipment, etc.
Were you going to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something could be done differently.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that all new things are taken with caution and take a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare to say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction.
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not just an advance for them, but for society as a whole.
Did the fact that you are a demanding boss help you, as many people describe you?
If we want to do a quality job, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their heads in the clouds and when they learn they have to go two days to rehearsal, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something done.
The band The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already in early 1998?
Only one: La<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We’re an open group, people come in and out, you can’t avoid it.
Whoever has will and desire will always find the doors open.
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place at Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will be attended by 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconferencing to sing together the band's song The Tap Tap "End of the world, canceled"
The aim of the concert is to bring together the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of STUDEO educational center without barriers in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
Admission to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years of age have free admission to the pre-sale option at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the ministerial meeting of the countries of the European Space Agency held last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of the ESA. It is the second ESA member of the former bloc of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and participated in the Agency's project commission in the following years.
However, the path from Poland to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts already devoted themselves to space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld's conference at the Warsaw astronomical observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld received in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, he was known worldwide and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was given to one of the craters on the moon’s hidden face.
Already in 1925 a train was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known either.
It is unclear whether the rocket would be used for the start of the dredge or for its braking.
The information about this dressin is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzrojenienia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes apparent that the research came to the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 appeared in the specialized press the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski and the following year the study "Raketa - torpedo povietrzna i raketobomba lotnicza", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki, was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile techniques projects for military use and coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautice).
In the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problemy, for the first time, he refers to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowicze proposed the creation of a society dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902–1959), became the vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA significantly participated in the development of the RM rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had a height of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length, and did not weigh up to 5 kg.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 the air tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>dów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development would be the subject of a real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket would have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor of the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-step rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differentiated from each other by the space available for the scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, the first of which air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the COSPAR national committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Suspension of the Social Work Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court suspended the law on social work.
The resolution aroused a heated discussion in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and less regulatory competition.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with unbroken financial speculation.
The effect of the large differences in labour costs (salary) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, attempts to shorten distances and for this "produces a decrease" of the competitor's price with the aim of making himself the most of the market and thus increasing his margin of profits.
On a large scale, for most employers, it means moving production abroad, buying cheaper there or disappearing. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and is therefore not responsible for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
All of this contributes to the total disinterest of employers in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their pursuit of profits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present concrete statistical data.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thereby attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments put private capital at the disposal of their own population without taking into account social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes to existing laws.
The goal is to force the population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, especially in terms of wages.
This occurs, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees in terms of labour rights.
The result is increasing poverty along with increasing disparities between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who can’t keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already in the million.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly common case: people employed with such a low salary that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The savings measures of virtually all the southern states of the EU lead undoubtedly to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or to live poorly with a low salary on the border of society, with the hope that some day they will be able to capitalize.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another or never arrives, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a small portion of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media even claim to the satiety that the state should not provide capital to the economy, that directing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not interfere in the economy by interfering in control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its selfishness the political march and, therefore, the whole state.
In this case, the answer is clearly affirmative.
The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, charge the drafting of law to private law firms, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is passed later in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power emanates not from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation find themselves quickly in a situation such as the one described by Appian in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had long been disintegrating and the administrations occupied themselves by force."
In exchange for bribes, unlawfully obtained favors and help to finance stones or swords.
The rape and corruption spread without any hindrance and the people went to the urns with the crowded vote in advance"... "there were no people with character necessary to aspire to a post in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was a man in eight months without consuls, and it began to think of Caesar in the meantime."
The conclusion, like in antiquity, is that today’s society is based on unconsidered preferences of the individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is, in essence, unable to understand and claim the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbroken liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With regard to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The truly demolishing fact is that today’s elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
Suspension of the Public Procurement Act is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which both strengthen the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (Nothing emerges from violence and nothing could do it), Sting in his song Fragile and whose stribillo prays "Let's not forget how fragile we are" (Let's not forget how fragile we are).
“If my children didn’t want wars, there would be no wars.” – Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, various reactions have emerged.
One, on the side of Israel, argues for the right to self-defense and denounces the Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs, and tabooed Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is responsible for the killings that are repeated on a regular basis and who is the victim. After all, the citizens of Israel today, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to give readers a look behind the curtain, a look to find out who takes advantage of the tensions that have been dragging for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour statement in November 1917) on a small land surface in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have come to on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, about whom or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of the struggles for power is at the forefront.
At any time we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who guided their steps autonomously or if there was someone behind their throne who guided their actions towards a particular goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the world’s wealth in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been able to reach in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don’t know, but I don’t discard it): the Rothschilds.
It's not written very close to them.
Of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost all central banks in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, have been declared or are preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but Russia has subjugated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of America of the Rothschilds, began printing money during the War of Secession and was murdered in 1865 at the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their desire for world power led them during the years 1859-1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, decorated with degree 33.
The first war was marked as the goal of eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially from Britain, and the third was proposed to reduce the population of the earth to no more than half a million to a billion people (such a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury), and the latter was intended to reduce the population of the land to no more than half a million and a billion people.
The method by which the group of the wealthiest families operates, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of triggering crises and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, remember that the Fed was created so as not to repeat a crisis like that of 1907.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after, as a result, the First World War was triggered, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly and unjustifiedly from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great Central European power, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a concealed manner, a conflicting situation as a result of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, and thus the ideal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses were created, and then the national radicalization was created and the nationalization of the Cheollocs, which only represented them by serving them.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds pushed the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour statement laid the foundation for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler had thrown too much of the rope to which the international bankers had tied him in the beginning or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, in a similar way to the way that war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war.
If international bankers succeeded in initiating it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim of the first line of battle, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding and chaos machine, not only within the framework of its country, but also internationally. Let us take as an example how the sympathizers and detractors of Israel are divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice engender injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their striving for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their officials, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything in his power to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to turn him all over into a global conflict, and if we have any control of it, I will only pass.
Under what light are now shown the words that David Rockefeller uttered in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order.”
The new world order in his imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls his whole being.
"And he compels all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they have the name of this beast or the number of its name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in front, add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six.”
Argo Movie: If it gets crude, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist students took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation did not offer any positive perspective: throwing the shah off the edge could not be allowed, since if it did, it would jeopardize the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later escalated further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The detained diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the United States, his destiny caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
Failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck focuses on an episode of this story, which harvested a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees of the building escaped.
After a complicated periplo, they ended up in the Canadian Embassy residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to pull them out of Iran, for which it helped a story covered up an extravagant point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew examining the location in the country for filming a science fiction superproduction.
Combination of genres
The plan drawn by "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
Details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines the moods. On the one hand we find well-documented sequences of Tehran. The credit sequence shows emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were plasmated in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, Hollywood’s typical scenes are slightly lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: dressed men analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the halls of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the subject of mockery, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Small Goodbye, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film in which the action doesn't take place in the city of Boston, where it grew up.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed old film directors above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Tehran is "ruled" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence of taking the embassy is impressive for its synoptic ability which, at the same time, transmits the emotion of uncertainty and lack of prediction that arises when, somewhere, the story gives a passage.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the imposing team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here it doesn’t come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis at Tehran airport sharpens, the deviation from a call to America and the unbroken search behind its tracks turn into a madness).
Argo’s weakness is the disarray that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck’s film loses some dramatic trail, but it’s a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, assessing its performance and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it collapses, it will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflation of balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankonipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey on the most absurd banking rates, has now decided to announce the contest on "the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the EU workshop".
“After the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent share of women in leadership positions in large European companies,” said Pravo Patrick Nacher, the survey’s organizer.
Among the absurdities mentioned is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women have benefited from better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to the fuel which, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or the shadow directive considers the size of the cages of chickens to contribute to the size of the hen.
The factual prohibition of using the term "butter of ointment" has been criticized or the withdrawal of the classical bulb from stores.
A quality banana should be 14 centimeters long.
The Union’s apparatus often makes these kinds of decisions under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher-quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curves".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that by doing so it seeks only to harmonise non-homogenised national rules to date, which only complicate their marketing.
Rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive involves waste of foodstuffs.
The candidate to win the poll could be the EU prescription last year that in inflatable balloons being marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The US referred here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the main cause of infant death from asphyxia.
A similar restriction applies to the use of mattresses by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
The rules on European officials are equally absurd: anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, one must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union’s prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume set for preservative mushrooms, which posed a substantial threat of fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in paying those countries that did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application for grants.
This kind of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation,” declared then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in the autumn of 2004.
He argued it with the fact that in our country there was a lot of grain produced and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereal from countries without access to the sea.
The grant for receiving a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the preparation of Brussels grant applications.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often the subject of criticism, the EU's regulatory efforts and also a more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fiber, as are other countries in the Union, by the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc request, but had to change its name to the national ron, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and it became known as "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugarcane distillation can be called ron, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the world-renowned feta and gorgonzola cheeses, the mazapan of the German city of Lübeck or the ham of Parma, for example, are the biscuits of Karlovy Vary, the carp of Pohor<0xC4><0x9B>lice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebonec.
As protected maras from the EU, they can be proud of Pardubice’s gingerbread and Horice’s barquillos in Podkrkono<0xC5><0xA1>í.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura
Senator, how did you get to the presidential election?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If all was well in our country, then I would not submit my application.
But I can no longer bear to see how the last twenty years have been stolen in our country, how thieves have been impuned, taxes and retirement age have been increased.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to give it a solution to change it.
And since I am already forty years old and my nomination is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to present myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon afterwards it has set itself on its way to the presidency.
Aren’t you turning your back on those people who voted for you?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results of the Senate elections.
I later stated that if I were elected a senator, I would submit my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and the strongest mandate as possible.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but we are pissing anyone who wants to initiate a change.
To this is added the media, which disdain you and confuse freedom of expression with freedom of lying.
I have been told that I have sued journalists that I have been Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek’s adviser.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the property declaration of over twenty million.
To do this, the law must be changed.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group so that the guiding profession is recognized as autonomous work, and we have achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, either from the right or from the left, it is deliberately rejected and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to get the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is he considered a man of the right or of the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn’t matter to me, either a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we go forward.
I don’t care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to unite people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against bad ideas.
It's a joke when people say you're a populist.
But isn't he proving it with what he's saying?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get closer to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already working in the world or well-known experts are talking about them.
But without the support of Parliament, there are only footnotes left.
It cannot survive in the long term.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live broadcast on television in which I would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don’t want to.
If there is a strong character pointing to disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Take for instance the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I say that I’m just a fan, I’m not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I've just started in politics and I'm trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to get things out myself, but in case it doesn’t work out, I’ll leave it and go back to the private sector within six years.
It sounds like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that with a person I don’t do anything, that’s why I’ve visited a number of well-known personalities, because at best they would be encouraged to submit their nomination to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because he had a lot of work to do.
For my part, I have at least supported research journalist Jana Lorencová, who has brought to light the scams with light heating oils.
I presented myself from the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I’m on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls, and those who did, voted for the establishment’s representatives.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven’t considered it yet because I don’t have time for it, to check the untouchable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I have no money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
You don't have any money?
Talk about property statements, how is yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at <0x24>25 million, a floor valued at <0x24>10 million, another floor valued at <0x24>8 million, a collection of artwork valued at <0x24>10 million, an Aston Martin valued at <0x24>3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb valued at <0x24>1 million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youthful dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fighting against evil and injustice.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don’t have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don’t want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have <0x24>15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors proves that there isn’t too much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The cost of the campaign essentially covers what I will receive as a senator's salary.
But I couldn't live from it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I only wanted to make money, then I wouldn’t be a candidate.
So will you continue with your business activity to be able to live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I have left some of my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in spring.
People would like to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live by something.
How much do you earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I still win.
If I were president, I'd leave the business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "book mountain" - 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and there’s finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a crossing that passes through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
No one goes to those old-fashioned libraries for pleasure, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory city located at the gates of Róterdam that hardly deserves a fugitive visit, has the dubious honor of having risen with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 people has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this embarrassing situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear represented on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated armored concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that’s how the politicians decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: we had to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for both fun and cynical buildings, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked perplexed around him and squeezed his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the Spijkenisse mountain of books, the so-called `Bookenberg'."
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain is raised at the expected location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and townhouse buildings.
In early November, the mountain of books was awarded the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town lacking history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuite a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheesecake.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but rather prefer to merge with its topography at every step of its climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the brick floor and the elegant lighthouses unambiguously support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
As you raise the view you can get to see the park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally book shelves are arranged along the facade and in the center a huge dark room opens which is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put legs up the classic spatial configuration and take the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well exploited: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention is deserved the black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and shelf at the same time.
The sight, the touch and the smell are strange.
Even the most daily architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse.
And so it is like one day, on a Frisian farm, we encountered the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of few millimeters of thickness is used as a basis for holding the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts for two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, until it obtained plates four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a new car and sports shoes blend.
After 105 walks you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain a reward awaits us: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but also you can enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and its ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant pairing environment that keeps the atmospheric humidity suitable for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
“Although it’s hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Despite the fact that the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden rings located in a transverse direction to the glass facade serve to give shadow and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is about automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, a skeptical worker in the Information Technologies sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
Also, the Chinese traditional medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the "Bookenberg" as Spijkenisse's "late soul".
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, at the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its full file; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept is quiet.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our initiative now all residents have a certain connection with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved all success in that royal discipline that in the specialized argument is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
No matter how young and incult you may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more prolific role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on U.S.-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather peliagudic diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany agreed that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of an observer state of the United Nations.
Eventually, however, Berlin abstained.
- Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the special relationship that binds the country to Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don't think he supports the American stance either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about establishing a flight ban zone.
It has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because at the moment it is reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans find themselves at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they’re still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they’ve already started the road to a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Britain.
What does “normal” foreign policy from the German point of view mean?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions other than those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and in their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers, and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, he must be careful not to alienate himself from the Arab public opinion or from the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it so much importance since it is not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the U.S. by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German stance enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic breakdown as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps with this, Germany has managed to cultivate a certain respect.
After all, all this has done is to show that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a discrepancy between the United States and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed due to U.S. domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not actually have the extent to which it is attributed.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that’s exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but they must drive things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing with the euro now.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European stance.
Of course, this is nothing easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it maintains with Israel.
This has always been a pelicula issue.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or do you find it difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany hasn’t gotten used to it yet, it’s always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it still costs the country to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany is positioned as a major player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and nobody wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
U.S. influence on European politics is decreasing, but the EU does not currently cover that void, who remains then?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more prolific role.
Even if they don’t like it, if it makes them unpleasant or makes them even more unpopular, it’s life!

"Marketing Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the real eponyms do not file a claim.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given the reason.
“Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, attorney at the firm Taylor Wessing, which specializes in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case arrives at my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to register their trademarks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way as the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens an archivist in which he keeps the seats of the Beijing Brand Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is too well known.
In the big cities there are large warehouses of several floors dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word originates from the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have “fished” a rich man.
Chinese authorities don't feel guilty
“It’s detrimental to business, we have to fight it,” Pattloch says.
“The brand makes water, the monopoly position disappears and the damage the image suffers is enormous.”
The financial losses and procedural costs of the affected sectors are millionaire, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year, China is the third-largest luxury commodity market and the fastest growing.
However, the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the trademark registration is complicated and also cost a lot of money.
Processes can last up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long since the name of the lawsuit had already become a “market reality”.
“If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist money because the process has damaged the brand in China,” Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that was recently absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why today the Chinese can still use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo’s buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that resembled BMW to a large extent; the matter was addressed to the courts and Geely had to modify it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction of the original.
The Chinese government does not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, “the labor emergency situation returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of untreated claims has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is usually the case in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China is leading the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth year in a row, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been emboldened in terms of rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese imitator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
The imitator has managed to secure Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
“We ourselves have provoked this situation because in Germany nicknames are not protected,” said Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also dismissed the Munichers’ appeal.
In the following two instances, Freudenberg was given the reason, but the opposite party continues to fight today.
You have to be very careful
The case has now reached the doors of the Supreme Court of Justice, where it remains pending resolution.
Wentzler trusts in being able to resolve the issue favourably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that “the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review records up to a hundred years old in order to be able to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "six-figure sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly deal, but it was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care,” Wentzler says.
The dangers in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe.
In particular, if the imitators secure the rights to unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer attempted to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since abandoned this commercial area, but has managed to prevent registration.
“You have to be very careful,” Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what needs to be done is to “register in China also everything that may be vulnerable to protection,” as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the topic can be much more expensive than just a record.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposite party license fees for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir and in Swaziland, the orphans of AIDS rejoice
The story of a link capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers of distance.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and mocassins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
It was only then that the vocals of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor, and soprano) began to slowly rise, bumping, and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get almost out of his boxes by trying to put order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
The 50 singers, aged 23 to 69, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the host.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are approximately 34 million people worldwide infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found paternity homes in Germany for the 180 orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month a child can be taken care of.
This contribution will cover the school’s enrollment, uniform and guarantee a hot meal every day at the Gogo Center.
Imbonggi means in Zulu "story teller" or "pangerist".
In this room no one can speak fluently this Bantu language, but singing they know.
For ten years this choir has taught songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
8,733 kilometres straight away from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 people no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and the world’s lowest life expectancy, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s inhabitants are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with a little over thirty years has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this recognizable population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the opportunities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally engaged in AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What Are the Main Sexually Transmitted Diseases?
Bacterial ETS include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common virus-borne ETS are AIDS, the human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
The claws and the sarna are among the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected people?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more frequently in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis, and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively scarce; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has maintained a downward trend since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were registered in 2011.
That’s about a tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urination discomfort, flow, abdominal pain, as well as bubbles or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one be protected?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but do not offer protection to one hundred percent.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend that you regularly undergo medical examinations, especially if you change your sexual partner frequently.
If diagnosed early, most ETS can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, from the choir’s fees for their performances throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
"In total, we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini itself, a woman who is self-confident and with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
He takes care that orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "goos", as it is called the older women in Zulú, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans at their disposal, offer them a roof where to live, and take care that children go to school every day punctually and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken farms and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, has made many of the village's inhabitants undergo an HIV test.
This is not something obvious, since, despite the obvious fact that this disease is all over the country, it is not often openly spoken of.
A King with 14 Wifes
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king has officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unacceptable way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that HIV has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless temporarys that travel the country from one side to the other and take it where it goes.
According to Annette Lennartz, "free condoms can be obtained in any corner, but these are barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many at the southernmost end of the African continent still remember of the era of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to tear out a pair of tears to someone like another angry frontier soldier.
The journey always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children who are apadrinated.
Although this small village hardly appears on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river is well known.
“Come to Esitjeni, there the light shines,” said the locals.
And after travelling the 8,733 kilometres straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal halls of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shining from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is likely to be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also frozen water, as evidenced by three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that an ice layer has formed in the permanently shadowed area of the planet.
It appears to have at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably comes from comets or, most likely, asteroids that collided with Mercury.
No one has anything to do with the possibility that life exists on the planet, said Messenger chief researcher Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other life components have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
In a completely unnoticed way for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun right behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family photo" in which endless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, called unromanticly by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This sunken image of an extinct star was taken by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spouts in its extinction process.
In the massive Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object with a single eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helice Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation of Aquarium.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This star in the sky could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the Spitzer telescope’s infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated is still one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It is probably the remains of one of Saturn’s moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Remolin Galaxy.
Depending on the tones, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the Southern European Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark dust lines divide the hot heart of this stellar formation zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the clues of a cosmic bubble: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two galaxies in the process of fusion crash into each other to end up colliding irremediably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the surname Molinillo Austral.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, located 1,400 light-years away, is composed of dust particles that are between ten and a hundred times smaller than the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model moment for NASA's Hubble space telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This stellar formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosetta Nebula, new stars are also continuously emerging; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when hydrogen could be found in the universe.
Our Window to the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope is being built.
This allows us to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of this most economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed lifting angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its uniqueness is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the radio telescope of Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capability.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
It is not expected to take pictures until 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information from the cosmos comes to us from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been locating since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations for the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched to space on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for light from the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers start from the base that in the southern pole of Mercury there is also ice.
However, there is no feasible evidence, as the Messenger probe orbits the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first orbiting Mercury, scientists now have the certainty that it is.
Drinking butter daily and living for 168 years

A search for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour through the mountainous region of Talysh could be considered wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great streak through the winding road that passes alongside wooded hills, rivers with great flow and the simple homes of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it’s in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a village of which not much is known, except that they perfectly dominate Persian and Azeri and that they are very far away.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town presumes a perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit at all into such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists hardly get to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres between the two urban centers because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth the country enjoys thanks to the Caspian Sea oil has not yet reached this recognizable region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the World's Elderly," Fatulayeva says.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place who have exceeded the age of 100. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived for 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136.
However, the museum’s undisputed star is sheep shepherd Shirali Muslimov, who appears to have lived for 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate to certify this.
And if we take into account that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that Muslimov's age is quite suspicious.
“He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive another daughter at the age of 136.
Has Shirali Muslimov then been wrong in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
“In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, very old people also live,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia there are many older men.”
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; maximum when there is no civil record either.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the Talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, instead believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the high-calorie diet of the Talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Or is it perhaps the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the town of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 he is relatively young for what he styles for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it tirelessly moves a huge butter jar.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and daughter, both of whom became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play with two young children on one side.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that is served in typical cups with a bulky shape.
Mirzayeva’s teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the diaper hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son proudly discovers us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, which is why I have never fallen and have maintained its color.
“I’ve never used a shampoo either,” Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I’ve never been to a supermarket in my life.
Then he tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II period.
However, it all came back to its rage when the “loved father,” Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult that professes the paternal figure of the nation, which runs its country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when the witness surrendered to his son Ilham.
At least the older people in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva collects 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) in terms of monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And maybe Mirzayeva’s canonical son is right: “in our culture the eldest are very respected.”
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Protests rivaling each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is submerged.
The future constitution, with Sharia as the basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not escape patheticism.
“We have to overcome the transition.
And that that happens is my responsibility, to the people and to God,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Christian Copts, the Liberals, the Illustrated Muslims and the Seculars.
All of them, so far undefeated in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As explained by Mohammed Mursi, almost asking for forgiveness, he had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend his powers "to be able to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Are you trying to deprive the judiciary of your power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly troubling.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does that mean for “principles”?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal maneuver that it bears, to impose a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This is at least what a new article suggests: on all matters relating to Sharia, it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great power in all Sunni Islam.
It doesn’t have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that – in fact – would result in the incapacity of the judiciary.
Much of the draft of the Constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak’s dictatorship, these courts served to repress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As set out in the draft, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values”.
This is such an inaccurate formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, this is nothing more than censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, another prohibits insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it should be sanctioned.
Equally doubtful is the wording that prohibits "offensive to people"
Is a caricature of the president enough or a joke about a lettering?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
The opposition has been closing rows against the superiority of Islamists for weeks.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at Tahrir Plaza del Cario and vowed to make the Act fail before it could enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,” says Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third in the lists for the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft of the constitution should be "in the trash can of history".
Through Twitter, he accused Mursi’s followers of wanting to lead a “state strike against democracy.”
“When he calls for the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow it,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
“We’re not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been shed,” Egyptian media reportedly quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community made a call to celebrate a counter-demonstration; at least not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, to the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it with the cry of “the people demand the application of divine law.”
They demanded Mursi to "clean the country", while proclaiming: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that the supporters of Mursi did not want to risk something like this to happen.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft constitution and their supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now it would be time to let the people decide in the polls which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the drafting of the Islamists has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process that actually should have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or face trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," he lamented in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Mursi's powers to the three powers of the State led to the resignation of this lawyer.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it,” Saeda lamented.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester at Tahrir Square warns: “You are conceiving a monster you cannot control.”
The Norwegian rakfisk: the most malnourished fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country has something to do with its greed for an extremely ill fish?
Take a series of overheated cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet soccer clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
Then you can smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway’s exquisites.
I meet in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is salted truffle that is allowed to ferment in water during, depending on how badly you prefer it, up to a year.
As it darkens and gets colder, Norwegians come in the trophy to a festival that is held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this eating of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"You eat raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit from a drink," says Haverd Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who organizes the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from a drink large amounts of the drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit rather than rakfisk,” says Haverd.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I'll try some pieces.
If you can avoid spending it near your nose, it’s not bad; it’s not very different from a portion of sushi that’s been a few kilometers by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty hit Norway and in which, before refrigeration existed, fish was stored during the fall immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is removed and, obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and migrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete social services system.
A current of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and not much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be an important part, albeit rather ill, of Norway’s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes that can be bought.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer can or a sandwich cost you the <0x24>10 (<0x24>14) fridge each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it anyway.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 incident".
It is very difficult for the Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of theirs would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway’s current wealth, there has been the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“But oil isn’t the only reason why we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she goes through rakfisk trays and that, with her long blonde melee and her surprising blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, wise people.”
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; all but a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn’t have in the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Norway kept the wallet well closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy,” Anna says.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a loaded twist.
I'm in the snow doing tail to eat something; I've already had enough rakfisk.
Now a hamburger is undoubtedly something different and quite juicy to taste.
But at night, come back that nasty fish.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held where the eaters vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that puts the nasal pits to the test.
A television has connected live with a presenter wearing a squirrel and surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Haverd."
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls off the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapours of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexico’s incoming president, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take over his position, BBC correspondent Will Grant analyzes the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad right now.
In a city that, in the best of circumstances, is already congested by itself, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing huge chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but rather to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the nation.
He is faced with a complicated task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during Felipe Calderón’s outgoing government, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Peña Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week at the Oval Office.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Before encoded with the President of the United States, Mr. Peña’s previous political experience was as governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very populous and fast-growing state, which surrounds the capital; the opinions of the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute it to the merit of the growth of tourism on site and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive through one of Mr. Peña Nieto’s new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the steep and steep roads that were rebuilt.
You can also see plaques with your name at the entrance of a modern polysports and an impressive interactive climate change museum.
“We trust that he can make a real and lasting change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a member of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
“In particular, when it comes to security and the economy, we expect the interesting and real change that our country so much needs.”
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was debanked by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party about Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the assessment that the opposition makes of the lack of essence of the new president.
“He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a fantastic state man and, above all, he’s a person who knows how to listen.”
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Nezahualcoyotl, the contrast with the paved streets of Bravo Valley could not be greater.
Hidden under highway stretches is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was asked to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighbourhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he did not know how to address the problem of feminicide while in office.
The most critical critics accuse his administration of making his eyes fat.
In a concrete house, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner killed her.
“When I arrived at her house, it looked like she had cleaned up her body,” recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been hit and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross in which one word is read: Justice.
However, that’s exactly what the family says it has been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old chism, an upsetting, a complainant.
What they want is for one to simply accept what they say and to shut up.”
“But that can’t be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect,” he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will come with a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
“I hope he is the same kind of president he was when he was governor,” says the deputy of PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Neza City most fear.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to cope with Bradley Manning’s abuse allegations during his jail time
The trial focuses on Manning’s period at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The military soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that Soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while under military detention.
During the prosecution’s interrogation of Manning in a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Ashden Fein stated that the records of the weekly visits of unit officers that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints about the transaction.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence's request that the case be dismissed given that his imprisonment had been severe and that this had already meant sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought about committing suicide while in custody.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In Friday’s view, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after visiting Manning during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was imprisoned in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had classified the treatment given to him by the sealers as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any allegations of ill-treatment, despite officers asking Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers who had visited him had discussed those issues and had indicated that they would be treated, but that they did not leave any record of those issues on the record.
“They wrote ‘no incidents’ (after talking about the problems) but that doesn’t necessarily mean I didn’t mention any problems,” Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not denounced the treatment she received during the January 2011 meeting with a council responsible for examining the suicide intentions she had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get the reduction of the “injury prevention” regime under which he was under.
The military said they had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below that of possible suicide surveillance, to ensure his protection and the safety of other people.
“I wanted the senior state to know that I was fine and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention ... so I could enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to a military prison at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered committing suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was going on with him or what was going on in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world was only reduced to Camp Arafjon, that cage,” Manning said on Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in that cage.”
Manning said that once moved to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said that he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a shovel, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as he was forbidden to sleep or even drown during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming from the outside pointing to his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the scammers could not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so he could turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation that he had made in Thursday's statement that, after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of the jailers and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order given by the sealer to drop the blanket he might have been covered with, but admitted that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he might have used the elastic of his underwear or his shackles to self-harm but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had withdrawn his underwear, shackles and glasses from his cell.
Her lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences she experienced during her prison stay and drastically reduce her sentence in case she was convicted on the war council, which is expected to begin early next year.
The defense said it planned to make Manning guilty of minor offences and defend other allegations deemed too extreme.
The trial is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has claimed that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules of application to any detainee under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally causing the publication of information on the Internet, leaking information from the national defense, and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
Many have been forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
The Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; they say they remind the Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely come down for the explanatory and arrived in the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Posters pointed to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and another for "Foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I was supposed to go.
Having grown up in Central California, my whole life has been called "Mexican."
This is ethnic tachygraphy, in the same way my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York classify themselves as "Italians".
Later I decided to be a Mexican-American.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s homeland, tachygraphy or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish. Good enough to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary level of a native and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, he said: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment a Mexican is so likely to stay in Mexico as he ventures to go to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trade bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of anger.
Probably most Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender half of their territory to the tip of a gun.
But for the Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that are remembered are everywhere.
So, at the moment a U.S. official says anything that brings the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma stand at war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about anger?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason that there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was one person, maybe the father or mother or some of the grandparents, to whom you have closed the sea door and chances.
And most of the time that person fits into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of study, from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look above our shoulders as if we were in a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have gone.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is this gap between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first ones know who they are most firmly and the seconds this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered a part of both countries.
In the meantime, many Mexican-Americans I know feel like they’re not part of either.
We love to hear the Mexican band The Tigers of the North, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best in every country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to further complicate things, so I have learned during my journey, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much anger.
And, with wage inequality, galoping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be alone with this idea, friends.
It's fair.
If some Mexicans are still not prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful about how their relatives were treated a lot less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of useless and usual discussions about who started first, lots of buildings have been cut to ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the city of Jerusalem, and the metropolis of Israel.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything torn apart, whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in regional turmoil.
Maybe this will make your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that your lethal dead-point situation could be triggered.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the agreed fire is maintained on November 21, this week’s clashes have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will say they have forced the Israelis to retreat, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good kick.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most miserable and populous corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to put an end to Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its ruthless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renaissance regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The exhilarating members of Hamas say the Islamist half-moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where Hezbollah’s militia party dominates, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Ham’s allies are allied with the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, with the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood are Hamas’ cousins and its leaders rely more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
With regard to the military issue, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more peacefully... for a while.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the last wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part thanks to the barrier that runs through the West Bank, the main piece of a territory that aspires to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that are legalized, and internationalization continues to increase.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on January 22, is in a good position.
Why imitate those Palestinian twisted-ups by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn’t they shoot rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good kick if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing is imposing, although the Arab Spring could alter its calculations.
Although the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel too much, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is higher than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a war with the region’s superpowers will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire out is a good wish and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a dustbin that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics worsen the situation as the Arab population increases.
Cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic fee.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one that sensible people from both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper preach: two states and the Israeli ceding of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impulse to the foreign people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to stop the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a category of virtual state in the UN.
Mr. Obama also plays an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Again at the White House, he seems as reluctant to pay attention to her.
This attitude is a deplorable vision for the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Generic Tobacco Packaging Act enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases appear on a green lighted boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, pioneering in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with a wrapping of an olive green, awe-inspiring images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies for being paddling children.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all printed in a type of small font.
It is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government says the goal is to dissuade young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamour.
It relies on studies that show that if a person hasn’t started smoking before the age of 26, there’s a 99% chance they’ll never do it.
“You can see that children, even at a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,” said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls linked the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“Legislation will have serious involuntary consequences,” said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco, in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that China and Indonesia counterfeiters will bring to the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has benefited from the passing of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, claimed that the demand for pellet and silicone covers to cover the unpleasant images of the crates had fired almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco Tribunal, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Mormoris and Japan Tobacco appealed against a lawsuit.
Ms. Ha claimed that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was expecting more stocks.
"For us, it's a good business."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in view, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it to foreign websites.
“If you market tobacco and you only have this small window left to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews of brands from “citizens on foot” posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One might wonder if it’s just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
The Australian British American Tobacco reported that the industry focuses more on what the new regulations involve than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are affirming before the World Trade Organization that trade is being restricted unfairly, even though none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to adopt a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the mandatory inclusion of images in boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
“Photos don’t affect me.
I just don’t care about them.”
“You pick up the cigarette and save the package,” says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack tank in downtown Sydney, says uniform crates make it harder for him to put them on the shelves.
“It usually took an hour to unfold a delivery; now it’s four,” Yu says.
“The government should have totally banned tobacco and then it’s, well, it’s over and we’re closing the store,” he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get bored a bit
During this year’s Thanksgiving holidays, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is pretty boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting about duty-free stores.
But more and more academics and children’s development experts are praising the kindnesses of boredom.
According to them, it’s okay that, both us and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and can encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits that boredom brings.
So, should we accept boredom in good spirits?
Yeah. Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("Boredom, an animated story") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
“In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive,” he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating from the 1st century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways,” says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and bringing the idea to a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “desiring, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you.”
It states that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He pointed out that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is “the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boring can sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that while they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as an environmental or world issue, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be them.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape from a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups listened to a full-volume TV show in the adjoining room, others listened to it with low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
“When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, attention alteration can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the study’s authors.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored.”
“In fact, we currently know that moving or snoring, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person physically more alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain silent,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a “trend scale to boredom.”
The scale includes questions like “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that interest me that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teens are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human development and community at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and his parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
It found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while in school or doing their homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren’t in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that “adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its highest levels,” largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it’s not, as it can lead to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into substance consumption as a method of combating it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Boring is the way the brain tells you that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what is most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may no longer be bored, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to dosage himself,” says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dosage itself applies to other situations," he notes.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but also learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of him either.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant rumors of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire too anxious and disturbing to relate it to something worthwhile,” he says.
It points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
“In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when noise stops.”
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Consumption Act
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community college and footballer in southeast Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal across the state: the possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends drove by Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a court citation for possession of drugs and related items (small crimes each involving a <0x24>100 fine) informing him of the date of the trial.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote to legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response to hundreds of minor drug-holding causes depends less on the law than the location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana-holding crimes are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally enacted once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado’s most conservative district prosecutors have pledged to move forward with cases open for marijuana possession and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent newly authorised marijuana stores from opening up in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what's next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief at Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who take care of the regulations in the state of Washington are also turning around the matter.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licensing; all this before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say, for good or for bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states in terms of regulation of marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no real precedent that serves us as a model,” he says.
Washington’s law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6th, leaving also a year in which it will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to offer "adequate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of doing cannabis business in a radius less than 300 meters from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's playgrounds.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly created research group.
On November 21, Oates, Aurora’s chief of police, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city’s prosecutor would stop filing lawsuits for minor misdemeanors for possession of marijuana to people over the age of 21 and that the police would stop filing charges against them.
Police chief Oates said they would be in charge of enforcing the city’s regulations regulating marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to harass drug traffickers and sellers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter vision.
Following the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers and that they decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those violations that at the time they occurred were a crime,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places like Mesa rural county, where voters rejected the initiative on marijuana legalization.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer cite adults for holding small amounts.
Pete Hochzinger, the county district prosecutor, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession.
"I don't think he's wasting his time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered easy to bring marijuana for recreational use to the government and the judiciary.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials with respect to the great ecological experiment in this state.
“This is a cultural barrier with district prosecutors,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the accused for marijuana possession and is a local spokesman for the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
“They’ve spent so much time bringing people to court that they can’t actually accept it as legal,” he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become national trial cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales frontier, they also look forward to receiving directions from the federal government, which still envisages the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana have the hope that the Department of Justice will give up.
Despite some prominent arrests of patients and marijuana vendors for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has largely allowed marijuana sales to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"While anti-drug agents are likely not knocking down doors to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed under the new law," said Obama's former drug policy advisor Kevin A. Sabet.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will take about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose passed a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
“We don’t want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a board member.
“Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying for what the community voted against voting for what the state voted for."
There are many questions about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed to Oxford for being a Tory"
Students are not attacked for their views only now.
I don’t remember any time in my life when I haven’t been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my elder brother had been in what I was supposed to be the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, after two weeks of occupying my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to run the History career, I had already made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper stated that I had abandoned because I did not tolerate some college colleagues to have sex in the room next door.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that I had gone because I was forced to drink in squashed cups.
The truth was less fun.
Get out of there.
Yes, I fled, because she had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one single reason, that in the cradle of the supposed illustration it turned out something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe you're wondering what that is all about now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-centered students are undergoing similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative party students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights as homosexuals, disabled people, and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (Graduate Student Group) of Corpus Christi College say they are “often seriously separated, personally attacked, and treated as ungrateful” for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on the Equal Opportunity Committee of their college to ensure that they can freely express their views.
His situation was not favoured by a recent BBC2 documentary titled "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and presenting the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former chairman of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a stick with a silver handle.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" by introducing higher tuition rates.
Luke Black, 20, and vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Party Association, said in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of leftists in universities.
“People assume we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, says this environment is "inconvenient", while 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, an elected president of the OUCA, says the attitude of JCR members towards right-centered people has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as the well-being of members,” he said.
During my first weeks in Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
Hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny former student Margaret Thatcher a "honoris causa" title after cuts in higher education funding.
The atmosphere would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the welcome week to the new university students, when the new students get to know each other and the cathedrals, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that not only did the cathedrals take a bold look at the mob of conservative university students, but they participated in it with goodwill.
The miners’ strike policy, the government’s privatization and opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminar.
At first I had to translate French texts from the 18th century into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Mrs. Wyatt," said cathedral Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Not one of them.
Pitt, a lowly man with a face that looked like a mass of biscuit, knew how to expel bad bile.
“Is it that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French, or is it that they are simply stupid?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt said.
I went back to my room like a soul in grief.
That night I sat alone at dinner in college; then I felt a slight palm on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he kindly told me.
“I’m afraid that’s how it goes.
They're dealing with anyone who's suspected to be Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your dad's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories seem to be laborers.”
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with all that Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted this song.
I became a dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sexual relations?" one asked.
"They're giving each other a kick, aren't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who think like me only after nightfall?
Would I have to become a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History destined for my college.
They hated him for being not only the Conservative party, but also Thatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of the people who wrote his speeches.
I was just out there.
I hated the place because I considered it provincial and insignificant and for its adherence to the Marxist-Determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I began to move daily from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding refuge in my more open metropolitan mentality family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
You didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends have always had an impeccable attitude.”
Her painful eyes began to blur.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just for a joke.
My heart would break if you let it go.”
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another History professor had insinuated, totally serious, that I was an “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "old fools."
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the cage of my college career in Oxford.
At the time, my father was writing two weekly columns in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked with a key.
I was in a state of fear and, five minutes later, my persecutors gave up.
When I left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you'll call me weak cryona.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, who has not only formed 14 Conservative Prime Ministers but, to this day, hides behind an unmerited reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentine prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", a retrospective apotheosis that brings together more than 130 high-seam dresses created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colloquium of a story whose only protagonist is "Il señore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarity and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until next March 3, there are plenty of private letters and photos with the signature of the greatest of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches those personal memories as trophies of his social ascension: from the humble modest of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with the realm has nothing wrong.
“At least they don’t turn off the hills of their furs on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to their chalet in Gstaad," explains "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife, intimate with forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, making a Valentine's Day
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the modist.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner on her floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, everything was seen and felt its spirit.
"To each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the High Costure Week in Paris, in 1995.
“It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Parade of Alcurnia
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-coordinated love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-meter-long passerelle that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the passerelle to contemplate a "auditorium" of dreaming that looks like the masterpieces of Valentino, or a dress he used in the "Farath" that said to Jackyne.
In that audience of mannequins shine names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modist, 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentine's Day is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember him perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a gillette jacket and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he made to me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I prefer him over others because of his femininity, because of his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty,” the former Duchess of Feria added.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and are "donating" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The fashion princess and prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she saw a Valentine.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of getting the age and opportunity to wear one of his night outfits.
The time finally came at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first Valentine’s dress to wear at a party at my cousin’s castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with skirts, draped "corsage" and sketches word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her modist's party dresses with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it's also the set of memories it brings."
The "King of Fashion"
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding costume at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the modist calls his sewing machines) to make that ivory silk suit with pearl embossings, twelve different types of lace and a four-and-a-half-meter tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the high seam of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of high society".
Obnubilated for years with the elite's "savoir-être", now Valentino is his best exemplary.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of his clients' husbands.
“It has always attracted my attention to its refinement, its calmness, its shiny and perfect appearance,” says D’Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The world's toughest craft: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health by loading 70 kilograms of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and another who, literally, works in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their lives by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas emitted from Earth’s intestines solidifies as it comes into contact with the air.
After tearing up large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilograms, she carries them in two bamboo baskets that she loads on her shoulders through steep stone paths.
They are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters above sea level, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb a tortoise step, keeping the balance and sharply measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall through the precipitate.
They know that any transpiration could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who was discharged years ago by the risks of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents per kilo of sulfur they extract
Once up, tourists who photograph them as circus monkeys and, fatiguedly loading the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, better said, its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulfur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in daily life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As usual we charge 70 kilos, we pull out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries out three doors a day.
It takes three hours in each and ends up grinding, but it allows you to add 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhuman effort, it is three times as much as it would win in the field.
"The miners' newspaper is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a bartender on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2) a day and the tajo was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as heavy as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where Javier and Islam are Hindus.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has played three skins in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pass on bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and is irritated by the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
It’s the price you have to pay to get your dream.
“I’ll work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in a more than acceptable English language.
Punished by life, this nice and smart young man could be a hotel tour guide, waiter or receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden cabin with other carriers, it rises every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the middle of darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends to the crater lighting up with a small torch attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs or supply any equipment to carriers, who work on their own and at the same time the weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera charge that, along with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is for the beasts and not for the people,” Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades, protests since he left school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 pounds, he says he will endure working “everything he can” because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged between 18 and 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and sweeps the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... beyond, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, these pains in the knees that weigh and cough.
By balancing the basket over his back, Unainik can now only load 50 kilos to his 53 years old.
Every day, he and his colleagues take 15 tons of sulfur out of the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat road between the males.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth well, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the 30-year-old eldest, also works by loading sulfur.
Time passes, but misery continues from generation to generation one of the world’s hardest jobs: the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame race, stress, and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and believe in life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of a peppermint ad, but despite that – or perhaps because of that – the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (boil) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, houses the hope that with the ad they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill their "national duty."
This is something purely internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing ourselves, so we felt that this was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried a lot of things, like throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do our best to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 Children
What is not taken so lightly is the government of Singapore.
He spends <0x24>1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to <0x24>15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a state-rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2—known as a replacement rate—was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies at the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marrying and forming a family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increased singleness, and delayed marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in Singapore’s birth rate.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to cope with the decline in population has created resentment among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where there is a plethora of barely-disgusted xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for keeping low wages and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has now switched to controlling the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a lifestyle of loneliness and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units get exhausted days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who were previously put in a trap if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center seems to be going to have little effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it,” says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their career, the stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Offline Private is Private Online
Privacy. Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is about the quality of privacy or “the area of private life that you have the right to protect from any interference”.
What is private for a child under the age of 16?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by venting on the Internet situations that you would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys between the ages of ten and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” on a personal level, and “in the key and user name,” when they applied it to social media.
“My deepest secrets wouldn’t go up to a post,” says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“They’re very secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone,” she says.
In FB I upload beautiful pictures or games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t mine, or of someone who’s making the ridicule,” he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked people, crimes, or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he meets the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key of one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just go up them," he adds.
“Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or with my friends quickly,” he says.
Don’t hesitate to respond that you would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn’t listen to anyone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teen has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not to know 20 of the people added to their friends list.
“I’m not scared, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for the address of his house or his phone number.
“If they pushed me or just demanded the bags from my account,” he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying are not alien to the boy.
A friend of mine was being bullied on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“I never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"I just gave him privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or pregnant situations.
I'd do it, if I get sick or I'm tired of it.
“Although I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a bachelor in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it should be understood that the purpose of social media is to inform.
“The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game changed,” he said.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a master’s degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Native and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we’re still learning,” he says.
He comments that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or say to an age that maturity does not give for that."
“Also be selective when what matters most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children what privacy is through questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do it doesn't serve," he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others say about you?
When you tag photos of parties, did you ask other people permission to tag them?
And one more, do they all need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to show them that they have to act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
“One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, equally should be on social media,” he says.
Surveillance
Stuarado Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential for family parents to read social media policies consciously.
Understanding each of the incisions they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to the Guardian, it is key to remind the children of the lesson of “don’t talk to strangers.”
The Unasur Summit ends without making the Lima Declaration public
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven Assistant Presidents.
Efe tried on repeated occasions to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Chancellor and Presidency noted at first that it would be delivered after the closure, but later stated that it would be published on the website of the Government at some time.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by Peru’s president, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
The access of journalists to the information of the summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only in the press room was broadcast the soundless video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the meeting was the list of attending presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media asking for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this is Humala's statement, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South America Summit of Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently required by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which they had previously announced, was also not circulated.
On the official website of ASPA it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities endeavoured to ensure transmission systems for all journalists, but limited the acquisition of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a decision by the Hague Court that sets a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional summit and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear allegations from both sides, in the process Lima presented against Santiago.
“We will comply and execute the sentence that defines the differences we are bringing to this international court today,” Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts,” Piñera said, and greeted Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the CIJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the failures of that international court, following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the absence of Brazilian Presidents Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The President read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries were set for a total of <0x24>17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residency agreements."
Actions are being pushed to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-cost internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters.”
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and see a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
“We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... unifying our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations among neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional meeting he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan couple, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in a respectful way the maritime dispute following a CIJ ruling, questioned by Bogotá.
“Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
"We are going to review all these ways, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
“With President Ortega, I hope I can tell you that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takeover of the country’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc’s Defence Ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on Defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro-temporary presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans “killed themselves in World War II” and in other conflicts, “but now they are practically a homeland.”
He advocated, in that sense, the project of establishing South American citizenship that encourages the member countries of Unasur.
“We have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also expressed support for the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who give cathedral never commit to anything, and instead we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” he said in allusion to Ecuador’s political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he is not regretting that decision because he has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his “deep democratic and human rights values.”
He added that, at the time, “there were grounded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his process was not respected.”
He also criticized the Swedish court for demanding that it be interrogated on its territory for a alleged sexual offence when “Sweden’s own legislation allows it to be carried out by videoconferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that she had a small lung problem, nothing serious," he said.
What there is is the danger of deteriorating your physical and mental health by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“That complicates anyone’s health,” he added.
Correa noted that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a savior to allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a Wiki-founder solution.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of proceedings in different European instances,” he said.
"If Britain gives tomorrow the bailout this is over," he said.
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly permits, and as it has done in other cases, question Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or question him via Skype tomorrow this problem is over.
Correa took advantage of reaffirming himself as a defender of freedom of the press and nuanced that what he does not tolerate is “mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but the bad journalists in terms of profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this regard, he congratulated that these journalists were no longer "nor the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and he said that if re-elected, "it will deepen the revolution to continue on the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto to Paraguay in Unasur at least until its upcoming elections, arguing that the agency “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and legality-coated golpism” because it actually “destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy”.
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that decision is not upheld.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the willingness to walk together.
They need to be processed extensively to overcome them and move on.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the litigation for maritime borders they maintain in the same court of Peru and Chile, and held that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accepting a ruling no matter how hard it may be."
Referring to the possibility that he will be present as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, though sometimes it's quite hard".
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador’s, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed that likely victory, so we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
Winning would be my last term in the presidency and from there we leave public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS Deaths Today Cause Late Detection
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed the result of the test: positive AIDS.
“It was as if I had fallen a bomb,” he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make it “softer,” with no apparent success.
The boy hid it from his family.
She decided to take care of her illness alone and began to report on her; with such enthusiasm she already celebrated her 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG) HIV Unit, which arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him “because he was bringing a cut.”
So, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, still many people arrive when the virus has already caused damage, “hardened” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the onset of AIDS in the world, at least of the first cases reported, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, the scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impact on the immune system that patients report to 200 CD when they start the diagnosis4, with a better expectation of 50 years for those who are not drug users.4
In simple words, the above means that whoever receives the HIV positive diagnosis at the age of 25, under these terms "while being in control will be able to live smoothly until the age of 75," the interviewee explained.
To measure this advance, it is worth remembering that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS has dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths by May this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been guaranteed since 2005.
- Why is there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have had no drug shortage the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their status of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make early diagnosis and therefore have to offer mass detection tests to all people who need it.”
In his proposal, specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to do the test at a particular laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite his short age, was already in the stage of AIDS and is even a complicitary, he suffered from a sarcoma.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, I better come back three times a week,” they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take medication.
To date, his parents only know that he was suffering from cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active, but responsible sex life, I take care of myself and the other person," Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let them take the test, if they were at risk, that among the sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, summarizes the battle slogan for AIDS tonight.
Condominiums behind the counter
There are large gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist who has taken over the cause of HIV.
The biggest one is in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of one or a hundred, and that's fine but it turns out that there are those today who still do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with the sorority and judgments of value of social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which teenagers do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; that the condoms should not be just behind the counters, and that those hundred should be found in public bathroom dispatchers of the places that young people frequent.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
It is not about paying the cheques and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking if there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
“That’s not sexuality, it’s best to approach condoms to those who already practice sexual activity,” he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is 4th national in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections correspond to the sexual pathway, 6% to the bloodway and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since for a recorded case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. Court of Appeals a ruling that ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt achieved via a merchant competition in Mexico, the scenario sets a nefast precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures in favour of survival of the signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the backlash to judge Harlin Hale’s June 15 ruling from the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of an embargo on their properties in Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to Mexico’s leading glass maker to attend the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
By way of entry, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Quiebras Act, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, headquartered in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are the trade contests processed in Mexico.
The first point would involve disregarding international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnationally profiled companies.
In fact, for that purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created, and the American Law Institute was placed as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their parent, would not have achieved the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case where the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose intercompany debts were assessed by the Federal Institute of Mercantiles Competition.
The truth is, in addition, that with the votes of the subsidiaries, the Vitro creditors who fought against Vitro in the United States Courts, i.e. the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 on the back of the severe economic crisis that the United States faced, stamping collectibles into the country.
Soon, the signature of the González Sada family will appeal to the Court of Appeals for the vote to reach its plenary, i.e. the five magistrates, given that only three voted.
In the event of failure to thrive, Cerciorare’s appeal will be appealed, requiring the review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court summed up a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), in which it details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Mercantiles Competition Act, pointing out that the court was disbanded with adherence to the agreements with the 15 States and is signed by the States.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band skull: they get Vitro and they get him to the country.
Balance General
Sleeping for several months the complaints placed on the table by Mexican Aviation unions against the company’s ex-owner, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Aviation Pilots’ Syndicate Association has already found the bottleneck.
The court led by Carlos Díaz Chavez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the employer to extract 198 million pesos from the trust F/589 from IXE Bank, on behalf of Mexican Aviation.
Resources would have been channeled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
Searching for Dragon Mart
Meeting this weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of wall country products, with a calc housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast area to oppose the monumental cosmos that shattered part of protected areas and raises the mother of all the hideouts against the industry.
The ACTA has died.
Undermined by the government a demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-False Trade Agreement, known in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the file.
As you know, the action was given despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by deeming it an attack on freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Basketball Trotamundos Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been linked to the board sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has it.
And it’s that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether he was a minor category player, a National Higher Basketball player, possessed and a leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Vaqueros or Balon Federation president.
"I've put many hats on basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with his faithful wife Isabel for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Kings does not exaggerate by making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia denoting his extensive trajectory, bear witness to it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, the most thrilling treasures are those that remember his passage through the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years as a co-owner or franchise.
“These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether it was as a champion, co-chairman or manager.
They were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships raced from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at BSN.
From now on he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been driving here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a very strong player, 6" 7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was native and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Vaqueros championship with Gausse was enjoyed, but at a distance, as for 1988 it was already a more federal mandate.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executives and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we won the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre-Olympic Games in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we reached fourth place and it must have been bronze if it wasn’t for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
That 1990 World Cup team is the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one of the Pan Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a leather to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Snows, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players suspended by the crash of the Pan-American Mar del Plata, we win gold against all prognosis.
Who has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was certainly Piculin Ortiz.
Their numbers at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculin did.
And that without counting his trajectory in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best boricua leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, that the Ponce boys will only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the Island in the national playoffs.
Right now, children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and arbitrators.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and from time to time go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a scrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predator oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new Dallas season, died Friday afternoon from complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., Dallas producer.
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, representing again the iconic role he liked most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he plays Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he meets an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him to his home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his highest starring.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around a thrilling episode in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risked at gambling houses.
He also helped give the series an audience record at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and turned "Dallas" into the second-most-visited entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s cousin Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to bite her as a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reasons to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be interned.
“I know what I want on J.R.’s pencil,” Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiation he has lost.
Victoria Principal, the co-star of the original series, recalled Friday to Hagman as someone "enormous, inside and out of the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we have been fortunate to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
The recording of five of the chapters for the second season had already been completed and a sixth was in progress, the chain reported.
There was not immediately a statement by Warner or TNT about how the series will handle Hagman's loss.
Oriundo from Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried luck on New York's theatrical stages in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there, she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t put anything there that I would believe was going to hurt someone or hurt them in any way,” he told Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant he became an organ donation promoter and volunteered at a hospital to assist fearful patients.
“I advise them, I give them courage, I gather with them when they come for their surgeries, and then,” he said in 1996.
I try to offer something of comfort, like "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they're going to be fine."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
They begin a course exploring the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible glimpse: The end of the Mayan “long regressive account” on December 21, to which many people have clinged as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charme had no idea what to expect in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal hurricane that some have called "deudarmageddon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-of-time Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charmé told Rutgers-Camden University students this week.
If one looks at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only teacher offering courses on “the end of the world” this semester, in theory the last in history.
At Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, it could erupt a war.
This month, students analyzed movies with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with real-life examples.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to deliver a course, titled only "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the “imminent ruin,” students must study, generate projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Revelation, which leaves students no choice but to work “until the same night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old career student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality, is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing career student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But no student interviewed — and much less a teacher — said they believed in the December 21 deadline.
“Our first project focused on Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredit it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at Temple, West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he pointed out that there is apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise in these speculations.
“In other places people don’t think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course about the "end of the world" there.
“The Philippines are not participating in the end of the world,” he wrote, insinuating an exception from a superior authority.
We have an apology from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years many days of the final trial have been talked about, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will begin to think immediately on the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Some say they plan to go to “the end of the world” parties.
“Maybe you call some friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
