Yesterday I read your letter.
Go to the supermarket once a week.
Can I marry my aunt's husband's nephew?
I believe her.
She was amused by her son's baggage.
I said it was okay.
I have no reason not to trust Tom.
He was the first to help her.
Are the children already sleeping?
We have to wait here.
I'm Chinese.
Tom was not very active.
We cleared the road from the snow yesterday.
I'm not busy at all right now.
Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe you should listen.
He is a brilliant artist.
Come on, boys.
I like your painting.
I waited for an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom's so sad.
I want to share this with you.
Study at the University of Hyogo.
We will participate in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life went smoothly.
No one wants to help us.
They talk very quickly.

It's urgent to go to the bathroom.

You are the highest.
Isn't that funny, Tom?

Don't break my heart.
I don't have any plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We're having fun.
It's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to her about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom was angry.
I'm already old.
I've got the dirty criminal fed.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English at a bookstore.
Tomorrow I go to the bookstore to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What is your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Everybody go.
The giant pandas live only in China.
I'm being followed.
Don't say things like that.
From bad to worse!

Tom was playing football.
She stops beating.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Take off your bike.
I understood it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not an appointment.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
It doesn't seem too surprising.
I don't go to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's insane, isn't he?
Is this cage designed to protect you from sharks?
Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you had called me.
You don't want a job?

I'm faithful.
Do you know how to write in braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You have to become more active.
Are Tom and Mary kidding?
It's a smoke break.
I have no alternative.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than him.
What will he do this summer?
He was irritated.
You've been talking to Shangri-la?
He narrowed down because I washed him.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
She's still there with her, isn't she?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have much appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
Who is your favorite rapper?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's nice to see her so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why is he leaving so early?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell like gas.
I'll tell them that's not true.
Here's a picture of him.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Give me some ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a conference.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for the lesson.
It's a little overweight, isn't it?
Who's the man who's playing the piano?
I had decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all of his income on drinking.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem of your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you coming in?
Tom wrestled her.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When is your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unresolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.
He made the promise to write to me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise my son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I like to be right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot if he drank wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50,000 for this statue. "Who else will offer?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to get rid of it.
Tom hated it.
I rarely do it almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer evening.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not very funny at the parties, are you?
He searched the car keys in his bag.
I really don't want to talk.
So he must be Argentinian.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more cautious.
She's shocked.
He should have done it yesterday.
I am a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your fate is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go there now.
No one wants to help you.
It will be clear in the afternoon.

I thought it was a combination.
What do you see when you look at that picture?
How many continents in the world?
He's good at singing, isn't he?

Tom likes to fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.

Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.

We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still sleeping.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but as you like.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He plays the drum.
It must be hot.

The fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have anything to say?
Scandals!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Take care of the language.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're back in advance.
We've left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
Would you like to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.

They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did you have lunch?

June is not that far.
Why do you hate Tom so much?
You know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
My shoes were wet.
The key was left in the room.
You're leaving me?
You've always liked Tom.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, okay?
Did you want to ask me questions?
Don't play with Tom.
You'll land on your feet.

May all your wishes come true!
She's already done it.
He is an expert with a word processor.
He was at the gate of death.
You're hurt, aren't you?
His table is ready.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?

Now let's talk.
I can't solve this problem.
He hit him in the head.
It'll be a lot of fun.

What did Tom give you for Christmas?
It's very close.
We've seen them.
Canada, a country covered in snow and ice eight months a year, inhabited by barbarians, bears and castors.
Don't come to my room.
Do you hate him so much?
He's a very lucky man.

How do you interpret poetry?
I have the honor to work with Tom.
He started to work.
There is plenty of oil in that country.
You don't have to worry.
I know it sounds silly.
Give me the car key, please.
She's not naked.
I'll show you how it works.
Am I sliding?
Please show me another example.
I cut myself with a knife.
Tom will take care of us.
Where did I put my keys?
Have you ever read the Bible?
We've tried everything.
"Look at that!" he said triumphantly.
I'll give him some advice.
How are your summer holidays?
I don’t like poker at all.
How is your job search going?
I felt Tom was killed.
I was ready to do it.
Tom is stupid.
Mike came back from the library at five.
I didn't vote for Tom.
He was seen crossing the street.
I'm like my brother.
I'll go.
Do you really think it's necessary?
All those who came along the road were surprised.
Who? Who?
Enter your name here.
He's very selfish, isn't he?
I could try.
He lost himself while he was walking through the woods.
How long will you stay?
Tom and Mary are really jealous, aren't they?
They gave an answer to every question.
Please, fill the front.
I came here to learn.
Drink the medicine.
I can see a pattern.
He was unable to attend the party.
Are you still collecting stamps?
It's not for them.

Why don't you wear that hat anymore?
The report was soon known throughout the country.
I love your daughter.
Are you bored like me?
Mary kissed her father on the cheek.
What kind of beer?
We are used to living in a big city.
They are our dearest friends.
In general, Japan's climate is mild.
I had three exams today.
I had no idea she'd come.
I'm sorry, but I'm not paid enough to worry.
Where do you keep your bottles?
You don't understand yet?
Can you teach me how to play chess?
What time should I wake you up?
There's no one here.
You should apologize to them.
I would like to buy a dog.
Layla was wondering where Sami was.
Take it out, Tom.
I was happy at the time.
I told him I wasn't hungry.
Tom's a mess, isn't he?
They said they were embarrassed.
Please take them.
Please, come home.
I like the professional fight.
Tom's hot.
Don't be so formal, please!
Do you think that's a clue?
I don't think Tom's beards are particularly funny.
He does everything very quickly.
Please don't kill me!
I bite my lip.
You're a moralist.
It's always been a hot head.
She likes beans.
I'm having trouble falling asleep.
The relief is instantaneous.
Lida is an intimate friend of Mary.
Please don't interrupt me while I'm talking.
I hope to participate.

She ate an apple.
Do not judge people by appearance.
She's jealous.
Okay, right, I understand what you mean.
You'll be safe here.
Are you proud of your father?
Tom is a bubble.
You have already been to Berlin.
You are too young to fall in love.
You're awake.
Where did Tom put my passport?
Now lie down.
He finally decided to get married.
Can I use your phone?
Can't we do anything?
The "A love B" relationship is neither reflective, transitional, nor symmetrical.
Add more salt to the soup.
All you have to do is scrape the floor.
Don’t give a child more money than you need.
Tom thinks Mary lied.
I'm not gonna talk about it.
I'm a fucking economist.
Tom wouldn't understand.
You want something to drink?
I'm here to help you.
He was too drunk to drive home.
I heard voices.
I respected Tom.
So what happened after that?
She's ready now.
Go play with him.
When it comes to brushing your teeth.
I can't fire her.
He had a shot of anger.
Don’t make noise while eating soup.
For pleasure, go to the supermarket and buy some fruit.
I realized I wasn't ready.
Mr. White went to Canada.
Do you think Tom is funny?
He's not sure he's going back to his husband's house.
I'm going to do a lot of it right now.
He said he wasn't interested.
What does the note say?
I don't have to blame her for my actions.
Mr. Gomez did not apologize for my mistake.
Is he a foreigner?
I think you're perfect.

Assess your progress.
How many runs do these buses have every hour?

It will contribute to this project.
The tree is sick.

Tom deserves an explanation.
Try to think about it.
Are you ready to study Klingon?
Who wrote "The Prince"?
I'll finger this never happened.
Sometimes, a little pride is what we need.
Tom has lost his money, his family and friends.
She lives here completely alone.
She convinced me.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
You kissed him, didn't you?
Why isn't Tom here today?
That should be interesting.
He moved west to Nashville, Tennessee.
I'll call you back later.
Where do you want to go?
Tom knows exactly how Mary feels.
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
Didn't Tom tell him?
He's got me wrong.
Can rabbits swim?
Sami was trying to learn Arabic.
You've become higher.
You're calling my wife.
They'll understand.
He read an article.
She couldn't come because of her illness.
Sometimes he's late for school.
My son is brushing his teeth.
I have always liked this restaurant.
I couldn’t understand what Tom said.
Dogs are territorial.
Tom's playing in the park.
Can anyone open the door, please?
I was just doing my duty.
I want to ask them when their big day is.
Dates to eat for the bird.
You know I love Tom, don't you?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
It's coming at noon.
He's a busy person, isn't he?
Tom asked everyone to leave.
I'm very frustrated.
She cried when she heard the terrible news.
I'm afraid it's too late to say no.
You're important.

I'm right.
They won't see me without an appointment.

Our cities create serious pollution problems.
Tom has a job.
How dare you talk to me like that!
Tell him to leave.
I like Autumn more than anything.
Tom is suspicious.
The good news is that we will be able to help her.
I usually take a bath before going to bed.
What I want is a word processor.
What brought you to Boston?
Do I bother you sometimes?
You want me to leave now?
We're outraged.
I hope you have had a great day!
I'm feeling stressed.
Mary's backed up.
We all wanted revenge.
Tom will never agree.
They're diligent.
I'm sure they're talking about us.
I'm lucky today.
It looks like a daddy.
"Do you have a dog?" "No."
It has a strange character.
Have faith in God.
Promise me you'll help her.
I wonder why Tom isn't here.
Many people thought he was too young to be president.
Tom was wondering if Mary could speak French.
Our train has arrived late.
Why is Tom looking at me?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
How's Tom when he's angry?
It's so ugly.
You're helping Tom study.
Do you like to travel?
Do you like Tom?
I don't want to be afraid of Tom anymore.
What keeps you up so late?
You don't have a wife, do you?
It was sudden.
Just use mine for now.
He risked his life to save her.
We can't be friends anymore.
He didn't give me anything.
His father was right.
Tom is very generous.
Did you let Tom kiss her?
How old could his grandfather be?

Do you have oranges?
Looks like Tom's upset.
I know you've spent the last three years in prison.
That's the norm.
The office is deserted.
He sleeps a lot.
Don't have it on the contrary.
We need to preserve our peaceful constitution.
This is a man dressed as a woman.
Tom is impatient.
Can you call him?
You will be surprised at what you can learn in a week.
Tom has a house with two rooms.
Don't say stupid things!
Give them the keys.
Could you tell me how to get to the station?
It's already good.
I think Tom is flexible.
We'll wait for Tom in the atrium.
I was ridiculed.
It was dangerous.
She was happy with the new dress.
You see this?
Tom has no empathy.
Is Tom busy?
He could die.
It depends too much on him.
Tom is kind to me.
It's not gonna happen.
Tom is home, but Mary is not.
You miss him.
You're different.
I wasn't angry.
Tom's dead.
I know she hates school.
My wife’s daughter has signed up for Facebook.
Sami called Layla for her birthday.
I was very upset by him to be so late.
The princess is wearing a golden diadem.

He's a little jealous.
It weighs more than 80 pounds.
You don’t drive because you’re afraid of an accident.
Send him that paper.

Put your books away.
His days are numbered.
Tom does what he thinks.
The river flooded the entire region.
You'd better fight sleep.
It's really ugly.
I gotta go help her.
The same waited.
You forgot his address.
Were you in love with them?
Hey, did you hear it?
Tom went to France two months ago.
I'm pretty weak right now.
Tom couldn't control himself.
Never trust Tom.
I don't look like Tom at all.
Our work never ends.
You know Tom likes Mary.
Why was it so slow?
We have seen three wars.
The flowers bloom.
Let's go find them.
Do you study French?

What method did you use to quit smoking?
The Morales are in the room.
We went to the beach.
I think they'll be late.
Tom is annoyed.
You shouldn't listen to me.
It doesn't change anything.
You don't have to change.
Oh, look, they're kissing!
I wish he had attended the conference.
Tom was taken to the emergency room.
I have a question to ask you.
Tom called at two and a half.
I live in Osaka.
I'm a doctor, Jim, not a lawyer.
I'm holding this place for you.
Tom didn't know who Mary was.
I won't find a morose.
Today the weather is beautiful.
It didn't matter to anyone.
You're from Urumqi?
Let me take you to the hospital.
We love what we do.
Together, everything is possible!
I want you to be better.
He's not back.
You'd better go and help them.
He ordered him not to give orders.
I think Tom's in trouble.
I'd like you to accompany him.
Have you been to Cairo?
She must've come out.

What do you want to do for work?
We want to know him.
Do you like the songs?
Do you really think Tom is honest?
I'll get married soon.

There was room for an elderly woman on the bus.
What's he doing here?
It's a delicate problem.
I went to see a movie with Tom after work.
There will always be.
I'm trying to avoid them.
No one can understand it.
I'm getting weak!
It's pretty overweight, isn't it?
I never believed him.
I am no longer his angel.
Tom probably won't be shy.
He recites the poems.
She closed a door.
I don't want Tom to do it here.
I'm in Rome.
Tom gave Mary a Christmas present.
I can say you're angry.
She passed away yesterday afternoon.
You're my brother?
We're coming to help.
This guy tried to kill me.
We arrived in New York at night.
Why did Tom kiss Mary?
Come on, don't be silly.
It's a little late for that, don't you think?
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Everyone knew you.
Why did you sign the confession?
I know Tom's guilty.
You only have two options.
Sounds surprised.

Here's an even better idea.
We've all ended up here.
For now, I don't have a plan.
He calls him often.
She's a musicologist.
Why did you give Tom the money?
Kids know that too.
Mary prepared breakfast for her husband.
I wanted to talk to her about something.
We should have tried harder.
Which one is yours?
I just changed my mind.
I said I was hungry.
I haven’t read any of those books.
Liisa was tired of the noise.
Tom was in the garden.
It's permalous, isn't it?
Are you wearing glasses?
Are you sure Tom won't be mad?
Tom will call the sbires.
Please, fill the front.
Tom forgot his umbrella again.
Do you have a cell phone?
It seems to me that he's honest.
Don't turn off the light.
They still live with their parents.
Who doesn't like that?
They used the serum of truth.
You're allowed to do that.
I didn't know what to say.
I'm feeling really good.
Damn it.
This is Tony.
He's rich, but he's antipathetic.
Read the book in a loud voice.
I think I'll go get them.
Where did you trade them?
I asked Tom and Mary their keys.

Tell them we're engaged.
Is Tom in the vicinity?
I need to talk to him now.
I can't see them.
No one's gonna know.
Do you want to do business or not?
Ask for a beer.
