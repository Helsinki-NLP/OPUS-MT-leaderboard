Traffic Flow is a study of the movement of personal drivers and vehicles that are between 2 points and that interacts with each other.
Of course, it is difficult to study traffic flows, as the next 1% of the driver's behavior can't be done with a certainty.
Of course, the drivers generally drive the vehicle at a uniform speed; therefore, the flow of traffic remains a bit moderate and it can be shown a little bit mathematically.
To better present the flow of traffic, three main characteristics have been established: (1) the flow, (2) the density, and (3) the vegetation.
