I really like your website.
I got a letter from my mother yesterday.
I unexpectedly got your letter.
I got your message.
I just met an old friend of mine.
I recognized his face.
I recommend that you learn French.
I was reddened like a tomato.
I turned down the offer.
I'm sorry I went to Australia.
Relax.
I remember you both.
I remember that, too.
I remember the day we met for the first time.
I remember Tom wearing a brown hat.
I reminded him of his duty.
I respect Tom.
I'm going to retire in four years.
I put my ass at risk for you.
First, get these guys out of here.
I'll run faster than you.
I run eight miles a day.
Futok.
I've raised the horses, sir.
I said that, but I didn't mean it.
I told you it wouldn't be good.
I said no.
Thank you. Thank you.
I sat down and looked.
I sat next to him.
I sat down to think.

I should've gotten out of it.
I should've tried something else.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I should've figured that out.
I should have followed your advice.

Will Monday be all right?
Am I understandable?
I clicked a picture.
I jumped into the house.
I ran into the house.
I'm holy.
Is that right now?
Wasn't it enough for you to ruin my life?
Isn't it gastritis?
I sold it this afternoon.
Sometimes I'm sad.
Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.
Is Paris far away?

Is that bird in the picture or on it?

It's been seven or eight years, exactly where you were, too?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have plenty of time to have fun.
There's only one or two things left to put in the leather bag.

I ran into you today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I study for about two hours every day.
I'm studying hard at school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you've already packed up and you're ready to go.
I've probably heard that sound somewhere before.
I swear to God, I'll compensate you for that.
I'm swimming regularly.
I swim two and a half miles a day.
Does your daughter feel better?
You're doing a dangerous job?
Your mother's home?
Is your mom home?
There is no doubt about it.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we get over it.
I'll take your place.
I go to work every day by train.
I talked to Tom a couple of times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
You'll be better off with your sister.
It comes with the love I feel for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
The price of this is two euros.
It might be a problem.
It can be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all this work being done.
He's clearly pissed.
It didn't break.
I wasn't bad.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
The snow hasn't stopped.
It's cold to see if you're coming.
He's not doing anything!
It doesn't matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem so complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese language.
It's like I've been shot.
I slowly realized that I misunderstood him.
It was snowing the previous day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for the trust you have shown in me.
This happened at the beginning of last week.
That's what happened on the day of our wedding, dear.
There had to be a reason for this.
It happened suddenly.
That was when he was out.
It's happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
Everybody's got it.
It doesn't taste good.
I have my own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think every fat person should have a diet.
I think everybody's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I find your regene boring.
I think there's been a couple of movies out there.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I'd be able to kill.
I don't think I could kill you.
I don't think I understand you.
I feel like I'm better.
I think I have the answer.
I think I'll buy it to Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.
I think I'm ready to change.
I guess I need more time.
It's like I've seen a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better.
I think so.
It's very unlikely, in my opinion, that you'll be able to do it yourself.
I think he'll go.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think it's unfair.
I think so.
I think it was Tom who helped Mari.
I think it'd be better if you left now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor could've died.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I think there's someone in the door.
I think there's something wrong.
I find the spiders cute.
I think she's home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think this should be forgotten.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I don't think there's any point in trying to convince him.
I think they did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's enough.
I think this medicine will be good for you.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom was already there.
I think Tommy's annoying.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Thomas wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom will be able to help.
I think Thomas's going to win.
I think we're dealing with it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we're headed in the wrong direction somewhere.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all disappointed now.
I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know the name of Thomas's girlfriend.
I think you'll approve.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.
I think you misunderstood.
I think you should go in person.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think you're doing a good job.
I think you smell nice.
I feel like you weren't convinced enough.
I think you were right.
I was thinking of Tom.
I was thinking if we were going somewhere to eat, I'd make it up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought maybe it was worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head exploded.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it didn't prove it.
I thought Tommy was still living in Boston.
I thought you'd trust me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought it was you.
I threatened my neighbor to kill him.
It hurts!
It hurts, stop it.
I'm under his influence.
It had a huge impact on me.
It's dangerous!
It's a historical color.
It's hard to get into the practice we were talking about.
It's hard to do everyone's favor.
It's hard to do everyone's favor.
I have doubts as to whether it will work.
It's starting to be very late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's time to start a new business.
It is important that we spread our language in every possible way.
Basically, it's your fault.
It's in the kitchen.
It's wonderful!
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to get ready for next year.
You need a little rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke alarm can't be turned off.
That's not the best solution.
That's not the right solution.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not appropriate to talk with your mouth full.
It's raining.
He's still moving.
Wow, it's a very bad time today!
Baromi, dear!
Thirty meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's an easy task for him.
It's yours.
It's a useful information.
It's hot at night.
It is very important to wash your hands thoroughly after replacing your baby’s diaper.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark when we get home.
You'll be ready when you need it.
He'll be ready by the time he needs it.
It will take a while to get used to wearing glasses.
He'll be knocking down soon.
It'll work if I exchange the polarities.
As a result, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I don't need me here.
I'd rather have a shaving.
Looks like you're not feeling well here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
It can be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This can save your life.
Maybe we'd love to try it.
Maybe I'll be late.
You have to wash it.
You need to report something.
It must have been love.
They must have been stolen.
It needs to be repaired.
It never existed.
It shouldn't have happened.
Even though I lied to him, I didn't want to.
I told him I was going to do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tominak not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like it, Tommy.
I'd like to ask you a question.
I've bathed a lot.
I've been in the bathroom for a long time.
I got it.
I was on Route 58.
I was sure you were on our side.
Yesterday, I took my cat to the animal hospital.
I took off my shoes.
I've completely forgotten.
It would probably be cheaper elsewhere.
It was raining yesterday morning.
It fell yesterday.
It's a lot of rain.
I work out two hours a day.
I travelled all over Russia.
I was travelling to the United States on a crossroads.
Actually, it works.
It's really sad.
I've tried everything I can to keep her alive.
I tried to forget.
I was trying to help Tominak.
I trust my life, too.
I'm trying to keep up-to-date.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
It's a big cat.
It's a little early for a drink, isn't it?
That's a boring word.
It's a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least on paper.
A grey stone building.
It's a housewife dog.
It's half an hour before lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a cooking game.
It's completely dark outside.
It's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
It's nice and good in theory, but will it work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's 7 o'clock.
It's already underway.
It's ten o'clock tonight.
One of my dreams has always been to live by a path.
Always the same note.
Environmental Disaster.
It's a messy business, Watson, a messy, dangerous business, and the more I see, the less I like it.
What a shame!
I'm sorry I'm late.
Too bad Tommy's leaving.
It's a pretty big weirdo.
That's a terrible story.
I'm freezing.
This is just as much art as science.
That's the past.
She's in school.
A very dangerous sport, where even a small mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
Money laundering.
That's a strange question.
That's awful.
It was crazy seven.
It was a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
This day is boring.
It's a tough day today.
That's what's happened before.
It wasn't a week.
It's been two years since he left.
That's better.
It's better to locate the garden at night.
It's hot.
Oh, me.
It's cheaper to take a bus.
It's Chinese for me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sundays.
Sunday's closed.
Sunday's closed.
It's cold at home.
It's cold, I'm skinny.
It's cold.
It's cold, why don't you get a sweater?
The bear is known to love honey.
It doesn't matter if Tom did it or not.
That's totally normal.
All right, all right.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep.
It's very delicious!
It's done!
It's not easier to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from a distance.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Marit.
It seemed to me to be an eternity.
It looked like the bus was late.
That sounds ridiculous.
Looks like it was only yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It looks very weird.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's not in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to come together for me.
I think you're being honest.
I think you're wrong.
Looks like we're gonna have an extraordinary guest.
It's a shame to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Honey.
It's fair to get the same pay for the same job.
It's not nearly perfect.
It's far from ideal.
That's yours.
You know, that's funny.
He's starting to get bored.
She's getting serious.
We're gonna have a hard time.
It won't be easy.
You're lucky to see a star.
It's good to be warm.
It's good for learning.
I'm so glad she was able to come.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It is not difficult to come to this conclusion.
It's hard to believe that the weather was clear and sunny.
It's hard to write.
It's hard to find a bed in this city where you can sleep.
Put it in hard words.
Hard to say in words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's lovely.
His head is disproportionately large.
It's high.
The children are already in bed.
Stop the money splashing!
It's warmer than usual tonight.
It's illegal.
That's important.
It is important for parents to stand on one side when the child is raised.
It's important to help those in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to drown in here.
You can't get air in here.
Inability to meet your expectations.
It is impossible to meet your conditions.
I don't know what tomorrow will bring.
Incredible, you know?
That's inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a feeling.
It's just a little bit more.
It's just a matter of time for Tom to get in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's pretty hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
It's nice that you say that.
It's too late.
It's washing today.
It's like an undersea field, and turtles, sharks and sharks above it, like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's awful how he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
There's nothing to do with it.
That's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
It's not as clumsy as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
That's not gonna happen.
It's not the job of Mennad to change Egypt.
This isn't mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not negotiable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It’s not about what you do, it’s about how you do it.
It's not worth smiling about.
I didn't talk to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't tell you.
There is no point in condemning a priest if you do not testify to repentance.
There's no point in ruining the past.
It's raining.
Obviously broken.
Obviously impossible.
Obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's okay if some people think they're peasants.
It's okay if you're hot.
“Three months have passed, and Tomi has already said he speaks French fluently.” “Well, he’s at the top of his silly nurse.” “What’s the top?” “Dunning-Kruger effect.”
Just three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, right?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's like I'm getting out of a mess.
She spread out her wings.
That's amazing.
Pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the aim of these theories of myzantropism is manifest in the assessment of the working class, renouncing imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars it provoked, and in conceiving the essence of the thought, according to which the wars of infinite men are wars.
It's just an emergency.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
Really, isn't it?
That's a really big number.
It's over.
It's rude to ask someone how much they're looking for.
They say the Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they'll be leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit! Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston.
It's so good to stay home!
He's still moving.
It's suicide.
It's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
That's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
The same old problem.
We still have to answer that.
It's time to take our tent tree.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time! Time!
It's time to cure the problem.
I should cut my hair now.
Time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's time to do something about it.
Tom's birthday today.
That's Tom's decision.
Tom's word is against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play the ball.
That's expensive to me.
It's too hot for him now.
Late regret.
It's too late to worry about it.
It's a typical autumn time.
It's a bad thing to get a cold.
It's dirty, corrosive yellow and doesn't harmonize with anything, but at least they don't gase in the dark!
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think.
It is unlikely that anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you whether we go or not.
It's very attractive.
Very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.
It's very fun.
It costs a lot to live here.
It's very nice of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we found.
That's your only chance.
It takes about 10,000 hours of learning to learn a language.
You have to be brave for success.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
He caught everyone unexpectedly.
It took exactly an hour.
It took me a long time to write this book.
It took me more than a month to recover from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to choose a pair of shoes.
It took a long time, but eventually it was found.
I turned into a little squirrel.
I'm lapidating.
Turn left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It's been a tough time.

It was uncertain if he would marry her.
It was an emergency.
In a few days, it's all over.
In a few days, it'll be over.
It'll be over in a few days.
It takes five or ten years for the technology to be ready.
It's gonna grow back.
That's gonna happen.
It's gonna rain for a week if it doesn't stop tomorrow.
This will threaten the well-being of the city.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
You don't need to do that anymore.
It doesn't take much time.
It worked very well.
It works perfectly with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
It's hard to get out of here.
That would be pointless.
It would have been better if it had already been arranged.
It's not courage, it's stupid.
It would have been better if we hadn't done it.

I was sitting in a chair at the patent office in Bern when a sudden idea came up: if a man falls free, he doesn't feel his own weight. This upset me. This led me to the theory of gravity.
I sat next to Tom.

I was with her.
I was still at home then.
I stood in the dock for 30 minutes in the afternoon.

I wish you didn't.
I wish you didn't do that now.
I woke up.
I woke up tired.
I was wondering what Tom wanted.
I was wondering if others would look as much as I do.

I'm wondering if Tom will be here tomorrow.
