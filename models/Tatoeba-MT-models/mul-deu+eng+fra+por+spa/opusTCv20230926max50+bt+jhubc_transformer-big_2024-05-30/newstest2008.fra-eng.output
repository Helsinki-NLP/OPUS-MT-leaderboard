Inflation, in Europe, overlaps with food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 euro area countries was more significant than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, according to the Statistics Office of the European Community located in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the central banks of the United States, Britain and Canada, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the leading interest rate by saying that the decline in interest rates, with the rise in commodity prices and the fall in unemployment rate, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to 2%.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we need to deter" inflation in order to no longer have to intervene on this issue later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record in the last twelve years, and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has begun due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Cereal market shares have increased by 88 percent and the soybean market has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the world oil price increased by 52 percent and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost <0x24>100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1, this year to 2.5 percent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, over the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to double its steering rate in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly in early December. Thus, since 2002, it has currently the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Institute of Surveying) has never found such a low-stakeholder support for 13.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, support of more than two-thirds (71%) against the support of a fifth (20%) for the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP).
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungarian Democratic Forum) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two percent in the entire population.
On some loyal voters to go to vote, the number of supporters from both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the country ' s economic situation to be particularly severe has never been so high, it is 41 per cent and according to the additional 46 per cent the situation is quite severe.
After the more optimistic outlook for spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expects a worsening, and only one tenth expects an improvement in the situation.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, a majority never seen in Gallup’s previous polls, said the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister at all, and 27 percent do not trust the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be addressed without change of government.
While after last October's uprisings, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, currently this rate is only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believe that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of voting intent, 60 percent of respondents answered that they would certainly go to vote and the additional 20 percent said they would likely go to vote.
For comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of respondents would certainly participate, and 15 percent of additional respondents would likely participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to enrolment rights in higher education, 79% would say no to consultation fees, and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stays.
When we look at only the same proportions of people who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of enrollment fees, consultation fees and hospital stay fees, respectively.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly twenty percent
The hypermarkets located in the commercial triangle of Budaörs have maintained the average price increase of 16 percent over the past year as the VAT rate has not increased this year.
Article of Daily Economy (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas Basket also increased by 16 percent on average, with a value increase significantly higher than a thousand forints appearing in all hypermarkets.
Prices, “already flying” in major grocery stores in December, have no longer risen sharply compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items bought well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Basket in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded at least 91 forints, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish have remained almost at last year's level, however, prices for turkey, nuts and pavot have risen sharply.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed data from the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread was found at just 139 forints.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the bottle included.
It only prevents this year, in terms of Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its daily basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent, respectively.
By comparing last year’s most expensive basket and this year’s cheapest basket, we find a 12 percent difference while the difference between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive basket is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noted in last year’s Christmas prices.
This process made trade perplexing, hypermarkets could not visibly determine what margin to apply to products as they were unable to predict the impact of price changes on consumers.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he risk losing a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in daily basket prices has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints above the 2006 value, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was higher by 1,630 forints than last year and the prices of the cheapest also increased by 1,284 forints.
As we approached the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months daily consumer goods prices rose by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH’s data: for some essential foods, the Institute of Statistics found a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, for flour and eggs.)
According to the Daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already quite expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have succeeded in accepting the brutal price increases by multinationals as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they are constantly recording good years.
According to our experiences, most customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-term foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, major queues formed at the box offices of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased dramatically.
Now, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the misuse of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overcrowding of medical staff do not help to block infections, says the chief physician of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also saving on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed at János Hospital Traumatology Service.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected in a man hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured in a serious car accident left the hospital but soon after he had to return due to an MRSA infection and since then the doctors have not been able to perform him an important operation because of the bacteria in his body.
As of 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National System of Nosocomial Surveillance, said Karolina Böröcz, the head physician of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Knowing that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two-thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSAs, i.e. staphylococcus aureus resistant to methylline-oxacilline.
One third of people carry the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their nose without developing a disease.
SA infections (such as angina, amygdalite, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a good antibiotic-resistant bacteria that will rapidly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicemia, in elderly patients, with low weight or with a weakened body.
According to the director of the hospital János, there is nothing special in MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
Above all, we should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we don’t find MRSA only or we don’t look for them, Tibor Nyulasi said.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the care staff put on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics suitable for treating them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, but infection can not always be prevented.
Sample sampling is not fashionable.
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances are not favorable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistance pathogens, says Karolina Börocz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and residences for the elderly, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases only see the day if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, the chief doctor of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to target antibiotic therapy, in other words microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient care and basic care, Karolina Börocz said.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, to wear gloves and protective masks, but significant gaps are detected in hospitals also in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient can not always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in the end of the epidemic, patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, Karolina Börocz said.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are observed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or then the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government Project Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for social security boxes, which is why this infection is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to the published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multiresistant pathogens (such as MRSAs as well) as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness.
The official finding on the fatal accident caused by the 22nd arrondissement commissioner was drawn up.
It can be ruled out that the 22nd arrondissement commissioner, who has resigned from his post since then, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven in a state of drunkenness or dizzy, Attila Morvai, a spokeswoman for the capital's public ministry, said on Friday.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which has already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd arrondissement police department crushed a 55-year-old man who faced him when he turned, with his personal car, on Kossuth Lajos street in 22nd arrondissement.
(By the way, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not an mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code a car that starts a turn should let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to the hospital.
Following the accident, the Commissioner resigned and asked for his retirement because, according to the police report, the accident greatly disturbed him.
The investigation into this case is carried out by the Budapest Investigation Attorney General.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner had cooperated from the outset with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
An additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
Mr János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Mr Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements worth a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million in Budapest on a credit line to support education, transport infrastructure and the environment.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, with a loan agreement of EUR 100 million already signed by the parties concerned the remaining EUR 200 million.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB approved a total amount of EUR 300 million for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million could be used later following the extension of the credit contract.
The parties have signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope first as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the project of subway line 4 was also addressed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible amendment of the initial contract once Hungary has finalised the details of the subway financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has allocated a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its appropriations at the EURIBOR interest rate, with a grace period of 8 years and no commitment commission.
Bulgaria, the paradise of the EU real estate market
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans little cited in the past.
What, or who bought on this EU market that is always the cheapest but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular destination in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sables", the "Coast of the Sun", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly looking for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balci.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the inexpensive corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, the commercial and office surfaces promise the highest damping rate.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus being a priority destination, after the summer and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the Bansko corner.
According to analysts, people who buy a building in Bulgaria are simultaneously looking to change their lives, their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltan and Cypriot investors are also present. On the shores of the Black Sea and in the most renowned ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, the proximity to a large city, shops and generally that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December, Bulgaria has been cited as one of the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who purchase in the hope of achieving a medium- or long-term plus-value.
The price of the capital’s buildings is constantly increasing as a result of increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially outweighs the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Six Percent Hungarians
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Water, the meetings of professionals end on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the ministers' negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol emission reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, vigorous discussions are being held on this issue between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, they did not want to discuss exact figures, but were ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is to see if developed countries are committing, without reducing emissions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol-defined aid fund will be managed by a 16-member board likely under the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) said.
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as a flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the "post-2012 adaptation agreement", and it was ready to also reduce their capacity to develop them to 30 per cent of the world's largest countries and, if so, the other countries.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries signatory to the Kyoto Protocol had aimed at a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and the total of the 15 EU members of that time took the commitment by 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, recalls the Ministry of the Environment press release.
The issue is great in Bali because the long-term international climate policy agreement must be implemented within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments of reductions under the new values of which the international agreement has been obtained, the international agreement of change, the agreement of the Kyoto Protocol would not be subject to change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in Earth's average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
The units of the British Army communicate, on the video sharing site, recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of becoming popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has become passionate about YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan are loading video sequences on operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken with the help of miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are monitored at the air force operations headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to London or the countrymen charge them over the Internet.
The political message is unavoidable
Air Force troops have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this path and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and it communicates videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Ministry of Commonwealth (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces also have their own MFIs in Iraq.
Mission in Afghanistan.
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were posted on the net for recruitment, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make the public aware of the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements made on television, Gordon Mackenzie, a defense consultant, told the BBC. On the other hand, it also inevitably carries a political message, as it specifically justifies the well-founded government by media operations.
The Americans played a game
The army is concerned because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site which also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about the present losses, but they never cling to the blood.
In addition, many videos had already been posted on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently been packing for loading these videos.
Americans do the recruitment a bit differently using the free downloadable shooting game America's Army. In this game the player can place himself directly in the place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas Tombola and Bennetts in the Ministries
Mónica Lamperth, the Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking beans and coffee.
Another department will organize a party with live music, another will enchant the officials with a tombola and offer a glass to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas ambience, concerts and buffet, so the power is fun.
Public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organised by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the Ministry’s employees who will be invited.
On Christmas, orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the atmosphere by the end of the year.
Compared with the other departments, the National Development Agency (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320.000 forints and, of the six hundred gross employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
During this party, the ambiance of Christmas will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NF<0xC3><0x9C> Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (OIT) building with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost a million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NF<0xC3><0x9C> is invited to another Christmas party which is organized with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, a bid management company.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to reach the person responsible.
Costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NF<0xC3><0x9C> but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, who, instead of a Christmas party, held a ball on the occasion of St. Luke on December 7.
The ILO has not made them pay for the use of their rooms.
The ball numbered five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister’s words of welcome and the dinner was followed by a dance evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening outfit was not at all mandatory at this dance.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Communities are preparing a feast.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónica Lamperth, the Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to a year-end working meeting.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have coffee and eat beans, the press service said, and the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his collaborators to have a drink in the classroom of the Ministry of Local Communities and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large room, where 436 employees are expected.
It is expected to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of János Veres, the PM’s employees have been celebrating Christmas every year in the same way.
No planned festive atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the minister's presentation but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas holiday will not take place.
The reception will take place at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the Woods of the City, and according to the Ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, it will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are initiated by a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not celebrating Christmas at all, the respective press services reported to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike gather
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers’ Councils will form their strike commission on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating the indefinite strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protests will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the health box law, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams as rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 13:00.
The League’s Syndicates will announce on Friday afternoon the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers’ Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be formed, serving as the coordinator of Monday’s actions.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protests will be held and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop working indefinitely if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in Parliament on the Health Insurance Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Box Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is voted, the strike committees will meet and then decide to take action.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Treasury Act will only take place late in the evening, or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, major traffic jams are expected: the railways will stop working for an indefinite period of time and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for the strike, the list of these is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report making the strike for an indefinite period of time, others have declared a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the M<0xC3><0x81>V (Hungarian Iron Chemins) and the Free Trade Union of Roadmen (VDSZSZ) failed to find a minimum service agreement, and, as Christmas holidays approaches, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, the public transport of Budapest will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., the Budapest airport between 7 am and 9 p.m., the Industrial Electricity and Thermal Energy Syndicates of the League will strike a four-hour strike for two hours, the Syndicate of the Professors and the Syndicate of the Profesors
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternately, the Health and Social Sector Employees Syndicate (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be established from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the functions that deserve it to be transferred to the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Roads Syndicate (VDSZSZ), attached to the League's Syndicates, of the Ministry of Economy and Transport's proposal for secondary railways and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard increases country risk
According to the Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the Hungarian Guard’s activity, formed last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarzózáczárt Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning,” the company notes that, in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that “short-term aggressive ethnic confrontations can occur as a result of the exacerbation of ethnic tensions already existing between the Hungarian gypsy and non-gypsy population.”
The research institute added that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is likely to provoke this situation, is the main reason for this.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: “Public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groups that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Tsiganes and the Hungarians.”
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are getting stronger and aggressive conflicts are more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activities of the Hungarian Guard "have significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, particularly with regard to the country's confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
They recall that as a result of the increased publicity given to the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and far-right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, calling themselves the “national self-defense association”.
“The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization while publicly declaring the preparation of their members for defence missions (catastrophes, national defense, defense of order), armed, if necessary,” they said, in addition, by evoking the politicization of the impunity.
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method that, based on the resentment of political society and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions from a civil perspective.
The emphasis on civil character and association status therefore serves only to avoid legal traps in the registration of these associations in court, but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk compared to neighbouring relationships.
“In recent months, many neighboring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk, and ultranationalist political actors in certain neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard’s constitution.
This affects the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, the political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, the constitution of which was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many disturbances of Roma that erupted in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the source of the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the UNBN decided to form a guard, saying that the organization’s goal is “national self-defense”.
According to them, over the past 17 years, gypsies have “terrorized” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, the Political Capital recalls.
They added that the initiative had sparked intense debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the constitution of their own guard as a resistance signals an increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the Political Capital Risk Warning.
At the request for information from the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on the risk change, they inform the public, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days, the number of which will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and in the United States either.
Hungarian law distinguishes national and state holidays as well as holidays.
The rest days are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year ending and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, especially so that the awakeners can rest peacefully.
In a year, we have eleven red-marked festivals.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as well as October 23, which is the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1 is the day of labor and on November 1 and 2 we remember the members of our family and friends who have died.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, at Pentecost and at Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases or there is only one working day before or after the red-marked holiday.
It is true that we pay the price for extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on the substitution days of the days before or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and all employees employed, to officials and to persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions running uninterruptedly and in service, by their vocation, and also to rest days.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost all over the country because, according to experiences, the majority of people do rather overtime or take vacations that they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between the new year and the new year.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around the work day to allow employees to stay at home for four consecutive days.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday 2 May.
Another change is foreseen for October 23: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
In contrast, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the New Year’s day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can terribly annoy colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that almost annoy us more: these are things that “decorate” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we are accustomed to these problems or face the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing problems to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you’ve been called to the marketing service,” a colleague told you.
Did you miss an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the matter is arranged with excuses.
Before you have painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There’s nothing more annoying than wanting to take a folder, an office tool or the phone and you can’t find them anywhere.
Do you remember the other day you put the graphene on the desk, but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you accidentally find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's office?
Don't take anything to your colleagues without asking or they're right to be angry at you for pissing off their property.
Do not bring back envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and you need them right away.
Do you take care of your colleagues' privacy?
There is no good way to stop pots that are spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (assumptions) about your colleagues’ privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don’t abuse his or her trust!
Enter the information you share and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you saying you're sick for no reason?
When you call the office and you declare yourself sick under the pretext of a tearing headache because you feel bad or you think you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your final missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you’re not going to work or that something might happen that would force you to stay at home, don’t forget to warn your boss and colleagues to avoid being surprised by your absence the next day.
Freezing, enrichment, telephone
You're drowning in your work, but the enrichment of your colleagues robs you of it brutally?
Did you become, unwillingly, a witness to a conversation on the phone that you would have better not listen to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with chills, chanting, loud conversations (which you lead over their heads), beatings, loud words, or loud dissatisfaction.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you blaming others for a fault?
If your work is not done for the set time, you forget to send a mail or important message, don’t blame anyone for this!
Don’t put it on the account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has presented disadvantages for others, fix the fault!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in your office?
Putting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don’t fit in the office!
Don’t put on comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don’t be overlooked, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing up properly, and if your function requires it by wearing beautiful and stylish clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you are no longer interested
We move slowly into the usual cap in the morning.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'm raising the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones all the time, then a female choir comes to join it like a real jewel.
Mr2 diffuse the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
Hungarian music life has not spoiled us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the cap becomes different if you listen to Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few new interesting productions born from the Hungarian digital underground are gradually beginning to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of garage rock breaking the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and played himself in the Yonderboy group before he started his own path, perhaps because “there is no room for two feet in the same shoe.”
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alliance of jazz, electronic dance and pop music, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
La saison de Ferenc Türk).
The formation playing at the beginning in small clubs began to be known to a larger audience when wan2 magazine cited their first album of 2002 among the 50 most important discs in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would be competing as well.
Zagar and his group have undoubtedly become “trendy” but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The band reacted properly, it released a new and better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, may open new paths for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from the former Pecs group of Balázs Zságer.
We are well there with the reference to flight but next to aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, rock and roll impact.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the album's debut at Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a true tube for the radio, Mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, who recently broadcast popular morning-to-night music, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So it's all right?)
hvg.hu is the questionnaire in Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube pushes me to ask a question: is your music still a music for a particular layer?
Zs<0xC3><0xA5>ger Balázs: The term music that refers to a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial and sincere music.
Alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only for sale and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be honest as well.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit, regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Overseas, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only young people of ten or twenty years, but also older people.
They follow much more closely the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, I’m glad to see more and more people come to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important in concerts or mutual influence already works, but it is perceived only in the unimaginable changes of the moment.
Now, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the audience's expectations, you wouldn't be interested anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow Yonderboi's example?
He worked alone and had a career in the West.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find tracks in our music.
Rather, we are team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it deploy.
In the beginning, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are several to leave his band and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the palm tree of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, Wings of Love takes first place.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style, did you consciously open up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the most difficult themes discussed throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
The six-member choir was composed, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0xAB> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This track had been around for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought something was still missing in this song.
The string of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same melody that the girls learned later at night.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time, but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There's no solo (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they don't have a single role, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than music, so the music just accompanies their singing.
They were behind the scenes as well.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is of only technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes, or, we just have to let these wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the music creation process, we had more difficult pieces when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, gradually, everything got set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I’ve already “released” this record.
Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader scams at risk of billions because of its inferiority complex
A concealed fraudster.
This is how his former employee, the French giant, designates the Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komer<0xC4><0x8D>ní banka.
The bank lost almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion due to him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equalize his colleagues, and who, in addition, can not be considered incompetent at all.
Unlike all major banks, he has acknowledged the American mortgage market crisis in time.
"He's fragile," his superiors told the police.
However, taking into account Kerviel’s statement reported by the French media, including Le Monde, his transactions produced a profit of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The Crisis Beyond the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the U.S. crisis to win half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, given to low-income clients or those who had encountered difficulties in repayment in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he did a good job.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion.
“As soon as I gained my first half a billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel said, adding that he had, of course, nothing left for himself.
In the whole interrogation, he confessed to having falsified the reports so as not to be detected.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange began to be interested in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything doesn't have anything
Was he afraid to be discovered?
Pretty much not.
“I thought the simple fact that I got 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them.”
Where does his willingness to take such a big risk come from?
He did not reach his position until gradually.
He had started working at the Société Générale in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around <0x24>51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader assistant and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of <0x24>90,000.
Yet he knew he would never win as much as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
Looking at my university course and my professional and personal career," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after his entry into office, he won his first major success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he earned half a billion euros by betting on the decline in this title during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone
“It was like a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I was winning, they seemed to close their eyes."
This is when the start of the year strikes.
He loses a billion euros in a single day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion because of him.
And how did we find out about it?
He became suspicious because of his holidays.
“Last year, I took only 4 days off.
A trader who doesn’t take a vacation is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to another,” Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has an opportunity to raise <0x24>365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the years to come, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech kroner) to the Czech Republic.
This represents about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns as part of the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit for the most part, up to 150 billion.
The Transports programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion SEK next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Businesses should get financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new more effective management methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the most successful beneficiaries of EU funds among the new members.
Court Confirms 20 Years in Prison for Former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaragua Court of Appeal on Thursday confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he was convicted in 2003 for a <0x24>100 million fraud (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released and was assigned to reside in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be imprisoned again is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officers, or they will leave Germany to finish his sentence at home, or they will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved government money to foreign corporation accounts in Panama.
These were fictional societies, and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that Alemán had created to fund his election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
That for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford to refuse it.
Contrary to the tumultuous debate that preceded the vote of the declaration of distrust to the government, this time nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies has adopted this law without any problems, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a sort of paradox.
Whether you like it or not, every chapter and every article is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is part of politics, although hidden behind the competition of power opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that’s why we pay more attention to it in the media.
Politicians’ disputes are much more interested in opinion than abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered from three evils that the current budget is not able to settle at the same time:
The first is the large share of the mandates imposed by the law, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" uniting the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M parties.
The second is a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle, he said, is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the state budget deficit that is the biggest drawback.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real delay bomb is the shortage of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued bonds in turbulent times, indebted to their municipalities, in order to obtain new sources of investment, except for the money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits.
In recent years, they have been able to reimburse these debts by the mass sale of shares of distribution systems, including those of energy, obtained by the state in the context of privatizations.
Nowadays, they no longer have that source.
If we only look at the official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through for several years, just like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD does not fail to anticipate.
This was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they owed more and more money to the state.
Other countries, with some exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have handled their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that essentially falls on previous governments.
We are one of the countries that, on a global scale, are the least endangered by poverty.
Therefore, we do not need massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have become unnecessarily inflated, just in recent years.
Although some of the absurd populist expenditures approved last year before the elections have been eliminated, if the age limit for retirement, as well as reform of the pension system, will not take place any time soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats distributing mechanically the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary expenses to be repelled by mandate expenses.
The <0x24>70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments hadn't dispensed all the money they could.
If we really do not want the policies in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give to this fragile coalition of governments, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what happens to be taken in taxation and taxation.
Only the latter will enable the gradual attainment of a balanced state budget.

Banks Want to Resolve the Crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of England, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than <0x24>100 billion will thus be placed in the currency markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
As an example, the US Fed will send <0x24>40 billion to auctions and, in addition, it will provide <0x24>24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
It is the first time since the attacks of September 11 that individual central banks of states have decided to take concerted action at this point, aimed at preventing, or even mitigating, the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of Economic Advisory Group wrote in his report to customers.
“Central Banks’ concerted action has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost <0x24>60 billion due to unrefunded loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for billions of more losses.
“If the central banks have chosen this approach, it’s that they have to really appreciate what can still be done,” said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The central banks made this choice after failing to lower London’s interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual loans, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and England had repeatedly lowered their interest rates during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as a further interest rate drop,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks’ approach will not help conjure the crisis, as it does not solve the main problem that is the fall in the US real estate market.
President Klaus: Ecologists’ Debate is Incredible
Global climate change is expected to be particularly detrimental to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
This time, criticism fell on the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying and the reality.
“The debate is not structured at all, it’s just a rocket of words, replacing solutions to current problems,” Klaus said.
In the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared also in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions."
Now, interested people can read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he still, in his opinion, has enough provisions to write such a book.
Indeed, he is an academic who is able to follow and appreciate scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following thesis: the climate is constantly evolving, the changes of it are therefore normal, there is not a shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, so the effects of the current changes are not too important, inefficient, cost-effective, inefficient, and not too severe.
Even more so, having the experience of a totalitarian regime, it considers it unacceptable to impose inverified opinions on others, which it feels is a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he repeatedly explained that it was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integral environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profits they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people have failed to renew their driving licences in time
Six hundred thousand drivers left the deadline to expire and failed to renew their former driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day people can still request the renewal, so the authorities are in the process of issuing them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid license will take the road.
According to the authorities, they did not renew their driving licences, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While municipalities report a drop in the number of applications for renewal of the permit, the authorities in the capital are invaded by applications and the number of applications for renewal of the permit has been increasing this week.
The City Hall satisfies about 2,000 customers per day.
There's a tail of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the release within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who fail to renew their driving licence by the end of the year and take the road without a valid licence will be subject to a fine as of January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also deal with the offence using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2,500 crowns.
According to old information, even a person who was not going to circulate was liable to a fine.
In doing so, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1,000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's license is, according to him, a document that people can decide if they want to have it or not.
It is not like with the identity card which, she said, must be valid without exception.
People who do not want to drive should re-enter their driving license.
All you need to do is bring it or send it to the relevant municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Individuals with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
The Court has reduced the sentences of detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Kon<0xC5><0x9B>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, former police officers accused of connivence with David Berdych’s gang, will be serving 13 and 10 years respectively in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague has thus definitively condemned them by reducing their sentences of 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Originally, detectives from the Department for the Fight against Organized Crime were sentenced to 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the High Court is conceivable.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is only waiting for the first-instance verdict at the moment.
However, in other trials he has already received sentences of more than 16 years in prison.
He can't get more.
In January, the District Court found 19 people guilty of holding, and today the High Court was dealing with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the accused, since the beginning of the investigation, questioned the charge by affirming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police, after an agreement with Berdych among others, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang handed over 30 percent of the larceny to Opava and Kona<0xC5><0x99>ík.
The prosecution is about the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Basically, armed robberies, in most cases of which victims have suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited weapons.
During home searches, the police discovered illegally detained pistols, guns with a steel core, a laser direct gun or a machine gun.
According to the allegations, the gang has been enriched with tens of millions of crowns.
With the exception of nearly twenty men from this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other robberies by hand raised Berdych and a number of other people.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves to the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived at the court.
The main hearing has for the time avoided Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who currently live in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The cost of child replacement: <0x24>12 million
The lawyer of the injured families Igor Veleba wants to get a compensation of 12 million crowns plus expenses from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>.
<0x24>3 million for each mother, <0x24>2 million for each father and <0x24>1 million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
That is why the lawyer of the Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál Hospital does not at all agree with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a claim, it is very high," Dostál said at the hearing.
“To be able to make an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report whose opposing party has ordered the drafting.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total should not exceed hundreds of thousands,” Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov’s family demanded a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Center in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress on different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better supported by men, although they were faced with remorse for not being able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, they say, remain less serene in the face of the traumatic experience in the present and in the face of what is happening right now, summarized the contents of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the <0xC4><0x8C>ermák in P<0xC5><0x99>íbyslavice and Veronika at Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
In late October, Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Governor Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il handed each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the error of the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are obliged by the Civil Liability Insurance Act.
In the event of a failure, they have to go to the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for help from the manager.
Until now, the courts recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polivka and loss of the Kingdom of Wales (le Royaume de Valais)
Bolek Polívka and lose le litige au sujet de la marque Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské králikství (Royaume de Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava regional court, it was he who had used the title King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko for the first time, but the project was put on hold by the team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, the former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today’s hearing.
Now, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
“The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasitizing on Bolek Polívka’s popularity,” Polívka’s lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comedian.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is of the same opinion.
"There's a job behind us for almost ten years.
Searching for money and focusing on events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize on our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title vala<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> král (King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohaty had crowned him king in 1993.
But at the time, this had nothing to do with the plan to set up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of showing the passports of the Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Království.
From a humorous action originally came a business and a lucrative business, followed by the creation, by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, of the company Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské království.
In 1997, Polívka accepted that his name and signature should be cited in the passport and even offered the holders balances on the price of visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> made use of the nude idea, published by Polívka in the mane<0xC5><0xBE> issue, for commercial purposes only.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka and certainly helped the project Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské králikství," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was formed by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, which devoted themselves intensely to the project.
Collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, assumed by singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ulaková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polivka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, requesting that the court reject today.
What could make the case clear is the tournament envisaged for the throne and half of the princess.
There should be a new king.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
“We don’t want to go fast.
It would be like the parade of the kings in Slovak.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polívka can, of course, register,” Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I’ve never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its operating qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the speed change, the driving and also the quality of the manufacturing could, in many respects, be classified as lower than the average.
Now there is on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which, she, is much better.
Even more so, as the combi named SW goes a step further, I have nothing left to think about.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I was complaining, for example, of space for the head on the rear seats.
As the complaints end here because the Combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be comfortable in this regard.
Let's see quickly done
I'm going to talk about the inside very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so stylish.
The seats are comfortable and the time when we could complain about too short seats or backpacks is over.
The lateral guide is also significantly improved with respect to the model 206.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the body is also noticeable there.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the already mentioned head disappear.
A closet in the closet
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage support.
I have to assess this as very accessible (also thanks to the rear pivoting ice) and a rather easy clutch.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not overwhelming and can be extended while being able to hold objects quite heavy.
But let's stop at the volume.
This makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure compared to the competition.
Apart from the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If you compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlada Boleslav product, it is found that the Peugeot remains very substantially behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or loading a buggy, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to highlight the advantages, I would mention the remaining cashier bottom after the reverse of the backrests perfectly right, or a very low leg.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, that’s what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatchback work.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by <0xC5><0xA0>koda, which often gives the impression of having an exhaust barrel blocked by a scissor, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the fares
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for everyone.
However, one must be aware that a pretty well equipped car has been tested, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a Otto 1.4-litre engine that rises to 329 900 K<0xC4><0x8D> is still plausible.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
Now, we have in addition airbags head, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of rear windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
That’s a lot, but try adding the extra equipment to the Fabia’s price and you’ll get a very similar figure.
There is only one option left to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is bad
The number of children originating in Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing the remainder to be concerned about the development of local education.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of indigenous peoples turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where the remaining conflicts of opposition and immigrants of Slovak origin are beginning to intensify, illustrates well the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, gossip and gossip between students have transposed into parental relationships.
The situation went so far that police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who hit a 10-year-old student with an iron bar.
The accused defended himself by claiming that the boy had insulted him with racist words.
Police were also forced to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two teenagers.
The young girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
“When we got home, a young man climbed up the bus stop and started scratching on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then he discovered his butts,” another unpleasant adventure described a Slovak student mother.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the survivors went to qualify conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between indigenous peoples and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70,000 Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can be achieved if you make the right choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all-inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or drinkable cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will find this list not only in its entirety, but enriched.
But there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the base of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and transshipment site of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and carried to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the U.S. (especially under the ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950s, circulated on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
Stars of the show business and politicians from across America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be able to mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, as the once imported jigoli and fiat have long since been rotten, in such a salty and wet climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is substantially decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by fans of small trains.
The cane had come home from the plantations spread in the candies on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how you can see small locomotives running there whose contemporaries are only elsewhere in museums.
Where to take his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
There is no need to write long about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise, remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that anyone who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Vinjales in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
An exuberant vegetation grows on a limestone soil.
Mogotes, limestone balloons and rocks rise in candles from the bottom of the valley, and since fertile land has taken hold in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetative carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco of the best quality is probably grown.
You can find the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman’s Chilean episode was filmed.
Trinidad
The ancient city was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the market that the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought it glory and wealth.
Wealth has been embodied in the beauty and vicinity of this small town.
Colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountainous massif, is a place so far apart that even in the 1950s, there was no road connecting this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
Nothing was built, and that’s why nothing was demolished, everyone just had a roof over their head.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is worth going to see also interesting places in the surroundings, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which animates after sunset and where the music is only softened in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this borough located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads leading there from Guantánamo must cross high and steep mountains and cross a landscape almost without signs of human activity.
UNESCO has listed the East of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
It produces the best chocolate, at the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after Columbus's passing) and from the hill where the old fortress and the current hotel El Castillo, you can see several mountains table, of which El Yucque is the most famous.
About coffee, rum, cigarettes, mountain massif Sierra Maestra, Troyes Bay and the island of Pinos, Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, African religions practiced by their descendants.
Only, as we say, it is better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, Americans say
The lack of troops and necessary equipment, according to the United States, influences the operation of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission in Afghanistan is not taking place as it should, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing opposition on the part of the Taliban, the eight States involved are also discussing plans for the future and the coordination of the Allies.
While the U.S. called for greater activity this week through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the United Kingdom prioritizes the strengthening of the Afghan government's authority and the intensification of development assistance.
“The development in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the residents to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Eighty-nine percent
Afghan insurgents’ activity is, according to U.S. military data, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in Helmand province in the south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, almost a quarter of them in the south.
But according to the United States, the Allies have reached their absolute limit both in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Concretely, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
“We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop made similar speeches today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about eighty percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo, which lasted three days.
Who is passive
In recent months there have also been conflicts between the countries involved on the question of whether all the allies are actually doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are committed to areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
This week, the British tabloid Sun described the German soldiers as cowardly.
"The Afghan scoundrels discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented with photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went into counterattack by publishing a photo of a British squad during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to <0x24>1 billion in 2009
The burden of a government debt exceeding 84,000 kroner is incumbent on each Czech.
The total debt rose by the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
Thanks to a better-than-expected development in the state budget, the ministry reduced the projected sum to 152.8 billion kroner.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
During the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
As of June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed its data on state debt dating from the beginning of October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 kroner is incumbent on each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has indebted more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it seems that, thanks to a lesser deficit planned for next year, one could exceed the border of a billion kroner only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one billion kroner,” Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimir Pikor’s prediction is similar: “We could exceed the billion at the time of 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget which is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I don’t expect this change,” he said.
Debts are Growing
State debt is constituted by the debts of the central government and is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
State debt is financed by Treasury bonds, rent securities, direct loans or, for example, by loans to the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt has increased this year from <0x24>38.5 billion to <0x24>719.4 billion.
The state’s external debt has increased this year from 1.7 billion kroner at the moment to 123.3 billion kroner.
The debt of the so-called negotiable state reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and as of June it decreased by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average feasibility of the state debt has risen to 6.5 years.
“Total debt has increased annually from the first to the third half of the year by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a far too high figure.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly by pension securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad for debt to grow, but on the other hand, it indicates that there will be material to negotiate when retirement reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better than what we expected
It follows the 2007 strategy of government debt financing and management that the government had planned to lend 159.2 billion kroner this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to better-than-expected changes in the state budget, the ministry reduced the expected sum to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is essentially made up of the state budget deficit, which is apparently going to reach 76 billion kroner this year, instead of the 91.3 billion kroner originally planned.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion kroner, the reserve of 10 billion kroner for the payment of pensions, the financing of state pension securities for 43 billion kroner and the repayment of European bonds of 1 billion kroner.
She appeared today before a court in Khartoum for appointing a pelted bear
The British teacher judged in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday evening by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting students aged 6-7 give the name of Muhammad to a pelted bear while any representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was subject to a penalty of whistleblowers.
The 54-year-old British teacher in office at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with violation of Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following complaints by parents of minor offenders.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the class pellets bear.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of the children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said Robert Boulos, the school’s director.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children out of 23 chose Mohamed as their preferred surname.
Muhammad is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any labels with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be offensive to a religious faith, “I just regret that she asked the children to “vote” her name.
Opinion shared by many students of the instructor who describe her as “very attentive to her students” and “who never talks about religion in class”.
Remember that the surname Mohamed is also the second most given surname in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the Prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They failed on Wednesday to reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbians and Albanians of Kosovo completed a sixth and final meeting in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their divergences over the future status of the separatist province.
“It is regrettable that the parties were not able to reach an agreement on the status,” European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We don’t expect violence immediately, but we’re entering a very difficult time,” he said, adding that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of Mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90 percent-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last session of negotiations since the Troika was charged with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to the Security Council in Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of Kosovo's administration, Westerners believe that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina says she is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not act in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," Kosovo Autonomous Authority President Fatmir Sejdiu said at the hotel in Baden, where these "last chance negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, a former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has expressed his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations.”
"Domino Effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic considered that a compromise was still envisaged, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of the province's independence.
Belgrade said in particular to fear a “domino effect” in a region still weakened by the 1990s wars of independence.
“For Serbia, it does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that "the parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made "in consultation" with the Westerners.
Bush breaks deal between Israelis and Palestinians
President George W. Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference, which he held on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately engage in negotiations to find a definitive settlement of the disputed 60-year-old between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the “road map” for peace that they accepted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, headed by Abbas, would be aimed at “conclusion of a peace treaty that resolves all outstanding issues, without exception, including the central issues.”
This call covers the three painful problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be “global and in-depth” and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others.”
In turn, Olmert has pledged to make the upcoming talks "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementing his "vision of two Palestinian and Israeli states" that coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment to Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saoud said in an interview with Saudi Arabian capital daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened, on Sunday?
As every time in this different type of fact, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to early investigations by the National Police Inspectorate General (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 5:00 p.m., Louise-Michel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention, but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without gyro," a police source said.
A Kawazaki green motorcycle, “not approved, so not allowed to circulate on the public road” (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated “with great excitement”.
“She hit the police car on her left, after a right-wing priority refusal,” a police officer said.
Alcohol control performed on vehicle occupants turned out to be negative.
The condition of the car (before detonated, star-studded windshield, shock-studded windshield) bears witness to the violence of the shock.
Very soon yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for “involuntary homicide and non-help to persons in danger” to the IGPN, co-ordinated with the Departmental Directorate of Public Safety of the Val.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, was waiving the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the police version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, some sort of scratch, probably caused by the frost on the floor, showed that the two vehicles remained locked up as long as the police car managed to brake.
Vehicles have been seized and will be the subject of technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel that police officers would have left the places very quickly, thereby not providing assistance to the two young men.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also remove “every serious fault” regarding this point.
“This is an aspect of the more difficult investigation, which requires more investigations, on which one must be very cautious,” a police source said.
Liberation met an eyewitness from the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows that looks exactly on the stage.
“We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to take them away,” said the witness.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely ugly policeman, who was drinking.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently with the certainty that the people present from the unexpected situation of the youth, the policemen were taken by car by colleagues arriving at the scene.
According to the witness, the rescues arrived “about twenty minutes after the police left.”
They also performed cardiac massages, in vain.
“I will not let you say that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the state of emergency was set up two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses said.
The latter responded by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers have charged and wounded lawyers.
Several would have been arrested.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court bar lawyers called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other demonstrations were expected to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday gathered support from religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "urged the people to send flowers to judges who have ruled against the state of emergency and those who have already been devastated by Musharraf.
“Musharraf’s promise is no longer true.”
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly targeted by the exception measure proclaimed Saturday evening.
In the coming days, she was due to speak on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election on 6 October in the indirect vote.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was defeated and replaced.
“Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a "civil president" after the emergence of the state of emergency, Information Deputy Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
His resignation of his military uniform was expected by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf was assigned to residence by his deputy chief of the army.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Today, more than one in three (36 percent) pregnancy is not planned, according to a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, according to Ined.
However, the liberalization of contraception has allowed for better “control of fertility,” according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated in the near month for a couple out of five and if possible in the spring, season considered the most pleasant for having a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel, indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools “bricked” by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical part that soon hosts European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of appointment pit for laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a 17.5-ton solar panel power generation module, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in position on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the re-deployment of the module's solar panels, which are 76 meters wide.
And that's where one of the panels, which spread like accordions, was damaged by a cable that stuck on about a meter.
The deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally supposed to make a check-out of the Discovery shuttle and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go scooter at the end of the 30 meters length of the remotely controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalkers in NASA.
Large, resistant, very smooth, it has very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor was charged with “operating” the “injured” solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he sectioned the faulty cable and installed sorts of "attacks" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained close to the Sas and, inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey can wrapped with insulator to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and “bricked” by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his tools and getting back into the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts are returning the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock market
The EADS share is currently falling sharply on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the Aeronautics and Defense Group announced it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS is currently losing 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to revise its operational performance forecast for 2007 as a result of delays caused by the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which conditioned the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to offset the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion euros, including more than 1 billion for Airbus", the European manufacturer's parent company EADS said.
Due to these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBITs) for 2007 when its quarterly results are presented next Thursday.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
For the record, EADS’ operating result dropped by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, that of the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The Choice of Status Quo
There will be no suspension on Sunday at the exit of the polls: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days after the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today addresses voters a televised message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the head of the list of united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is announced overwhelmingly.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be seen by receiving foreign ambassadors, simply delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want the most honest, transparent and open elections, the most open elections,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from accountable.
It denounces a campaign of pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov says that “there have never been such a dirty election, even at the time of Eltsine.”
After the crackdown on the protests last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus"
Behind these unsuspended legislations are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to get to know each other.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot hold a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and of the all-powerful united Russian party who would elect the government and the president?
In any case, both in the legislature and in the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet homoeticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny,” says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society has been delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin reconnected with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic ease,” says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “resign completely to personal responsibility” which they had briefly proved after the breakup of the USSR.
“What good to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: “What is good to think about?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fate of the 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archives, stored over 27 km of line in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only accessible for “humanitarian” purposes, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an ex-victim or its right-holders.
The eleven states in charge of their management – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, and the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out “particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health of forced workers,” says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, had objected to the openness of these nominative documents to the public, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been assembled after the war for a practical purpose: to find the civilians deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, if necessary, to provide them with proof of their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Commerce Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The EU foreign ministers had given their green light to the European Commission last April to begin negotiations with the aim of signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) (ASEAN 60 years after the Middle East).
The EU is India’s first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s 9th trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will overwhelm both economies" and "India would improve its access to a prosperous market of 450 million Europeans," Mandelson said.
Europe is still the first or second European market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner First. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services" and for "regaining the pre-tenths of euro", said in a statement this week to the European Commission's "Danièle Smadja's decommerci".

Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was concerned about alleviating the current return on credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at a base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"In order to alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its common market share during the planned period.
The bank said 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) would thus be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time the BoE seems to market liquidity at five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done within a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it is “ready to take other measures to keep interbank loans on a daily basis in line with its base rate.”
The interbank rate per day on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, a higher rate since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the amounts put on the market by the Bank of England were accompanied by a significant penalty rate that had dissuade banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the pound price compared to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more favourable rates and with more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss articles on the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "nest" (session at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined about a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Bureau of the PS including the 50% increase in the premium for employment, the recovery of the floating TIPP, a cheque-transport or locaene.
UMP and NC having voted against the consideration of the articles (180 votes against 115), the sitting was raised at the end of the general discussion, which resulted in exchanges, sometimes vivid, between majority and opposition within a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
MP Jean-Marc Ayrault has announced that his group will represent all of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill that the Assembly will consider next week.
A new festival is coming to fruition
Following many rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who has inspired, neither more nor less, the current movement of festivals in America,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is expected to take place from August 8 to 10 on a private 500-acre farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as “the most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and were working closely with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
"Unfortunately, we have enlisted in political lobby because of the current administration," said Charlie Jones.
Fortunately, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after debuting in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of <0x24>9.8M and <0x24>11.3M in 2007.
Both festivals are held in the urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours rather take place in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both the impression of a country festival to the European and urban to the American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event,” said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but claims "that they are interesting enough to allow us to invest in such an event and host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the capacity to host the festival is “very large,” like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said invitations were made to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of press release.
“Vineland will taste rock, but the music will be varied, in the hope of attracting all kinds of viewers,” said Charlie Jones.
Its C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award at the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faced the Terminator
It’s not easy to draw Hollywood movie plates in Montreal when no one but Terminator opposes them.
This seduction mission is part of the functions of a delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the “Governator”?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best,” he said.
The Race at Festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority, however, is the promotion of cinema from here on out.
The Oscars race has begun.
It will be a matter of all West Coast festivals, whether it is Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present Quebec films, to highlight them, and to make sure that the directors make interviews.
The Dark Ages had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks after the closing of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in hopes of the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year the experts are not as sure as it is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December in the stock market generally has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties prevail in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock market taking momentum in the last weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market feeds on the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in view of the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially in terms of the long-term value of fixed incomes, by the short-term.
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have rather lateral behavior, not volatility-free “particularly because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions.”
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
“That’s not the best thing,” the expert assures.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock index, has lost almost 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuance that things will be a little different this year as he believes the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution Day (December 6th).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and “that’s why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be caused based on the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the credit crisis on the market.”
The analyst hopes these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximums.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that “this year the big values are back for him.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, said the increases would be due to the banking and industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in the event that they put themselves in it.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” the expert explains.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do as well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only on two occasions December was a low month.
The authentic end-of-year rally took place in 2003, an exercise during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the breakdown of the technology bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a 6.68% increase.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for now the Ibex has increased 8.36% since January) and whether it succeeds on the computer at its end-of-year rally.
The People’s Bank will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The People’s Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the popular brand Max, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish agencies, as it is the first group to decide to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20:30, and to open on Saturday from 10:00 to 20:30.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its subsidiaries, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He is about to conclude an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to join or not this initiative that coincides with trading hours.
This is precisely what the People’s Bank is looking for.
Attract autonomous customers who circulate through these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 offices across Spain in about 18 months, as this is not the opening of new offices but a renewal of those already existing.
To this end, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the customer profile of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new, more current design, with brighter colors.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, the bank’s chief commercial officer, said the renewal would not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group
The People’s Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and the Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and with apparent success, according to Rivero.
The People’s Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand of Mundocredit, which specializes in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero says.
For now, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with a staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've gotten there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegate of Telecinco, yesterday expressed his satisfaction, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect of his joy: “The thing that hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have decreased less,” he said.
However, he emphasized the fact that in a weak market, ' we have fallen less '.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54 percent increase.
This gain stabilized its loss at 15.66% over a year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of capital) and announced by Vocento (with an additional 13%) thus reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which gave up 1.52 percent yesterday and accumulated a 40.5 percent drop since January, costs half of 2,193.46 million.
The value of other publicly traded communications companies is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that ' we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as Giuseppe Tringali, the company’s delegated advisor to Telecinco and Publiespaña, the company that manages the group’s advertising.
In order for this announcement to be real, the TV channel is expected to record a 3.6% increase in its advertising billing for the current year compared to the 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antenna 3's net revenue increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenue increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for Telecinco’s best relative development is the important payout it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated a lot more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those to whom we have already awarded titles with 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is currently giving signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its Telecinco profit estimates to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in expected revenue growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenna’s earnings forecast by 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5 % in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force on November 1
Along with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of Congress on the amendments incorporated in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulation to develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
Representatives from different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MEPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best possible regulation to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activities of organizations for the effective functioning of markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, at a time when it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial consulting services for both specialized social and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFIs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems to the regulated secondary markets, which are in competition with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment service firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management, and requires them to keep a record of all the transactions they perform, in order to facilitate control by CNMV.
In passing through the Economic Commission of Congress, several amendments have been added, one of which highlights that titled debts will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has proven itself with what happened with the high-risk mortgage debt of the U.S.
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management took advantage of to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after, in 1977, was approved, the royal decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend its services of product marketing and attracting new customers to different investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increases by five-tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on the evolution of prices in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policies of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing comparable data in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method as that used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information about which is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice-president and minister of the economy, Pedro Solbes, said the increase of 4.1% in the IPC in November is a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential about monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged from the data announced today.
Virgin plans to raise <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock over three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion) since it entered a crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, it amassed some record deposits above <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a figure that has fallen gradually in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its customers and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the government has offered and will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion until it reaches the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for its flagship advertising campaign in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Association's offer, which includes three other companies, including her favorite to save her from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard today arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the municipal police chief were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May’s self Juan Morales, current right-wing MP, and until then municipal councilor of the mayor, who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the ‘manager’ of this plot.
Officers continue to monitor the municipal premises and those of the Urbanism Council and the possibility of new arrests is not excluded in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As the SER Chain indicated yesterday to the lawyer of the 'popular party' deputy Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving Morales's home with important documentation in his possession regarding the plot.
In addition, according to sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged settlement of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people detained.
Bono agrees to be the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party’s nomination for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the top of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be the General President of the Socialists in the Congress.
The Spanish Socialist Party’s organising secretary, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced this during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of that party with Zapatero.
The chief executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the La Mancha politician will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over Congress if the socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who on November 15 made public his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic context.
The former prime minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the forefront of politics since he left him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, even though citizens already know who will be the vice president of the economy if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the president of the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or screaming" and make it "more and more like citizens".
“Sometimes it seems unfortunate that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times.”
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how to do" and he didn't want to pretend he was already in his position to not fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents could consider "domination".
Climate Propaganda
Since the Movement against Climate Change is subjected to merciless persecution both the skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
This is especially the case for a leader of the movement who is the president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach requires him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain's leadership in the European Union's failure to implement the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-execution, in what sectors it has occurred, and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be obliged to do, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and pay to save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of businesses and individuals.
Up to one-fifth of the fuel suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to Zapatero so lecturally dangerous that he insisted on denying it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have an impact, committees, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that don’t speak, who don’t complain and who doesn’t demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is merely a purely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we are moving on a bicycle or refreshing ourselves with the range.
Mayor and head of local Totana Police arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Spanish gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the mayor and a hotel contractor suspected of possible urban crimes, sources said today.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where at the moment many agents have met, who have also appeared as the municipal councillor of Urbanism and the municipal management company of Industrial Sol and Housing.
These three rulings are in addition to the six rulings made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 houses, after the last payment of the commission.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which Totana Tribunal No. 1 has instructed.
The first six detainees have now moved to a court order.
According to sources, Totana’s former municipal councilor and currently an independent parliamentary member of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the former wife, owner of a property agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councilor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the pots were made.
The investigation was carried out by the Central Operating Unit Urban Crimes Group (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in detainees-related companies located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas and Tozana.
Thus, a single person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known winery company in the region, which may have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana which have been requalified and its project is expected to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the parking lot of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the construction of the building.

Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.
Article 2
Our Finnish correspondent provides us with the commentary yesterday in Finland’s most important newspaper (certainly the head of PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that it appeared to be book-burt of the black curiosity.
"The content of the Philosophy course has appealed to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor's student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Educational Adviser in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that professors adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper and he stated that studying Nietzsche is not necessary in the basic course of lyophilization.
Article 3
A colleague passes information on the introduction of the Criminal Code on Internet Downloads:
A. The download of a song would be a passible offence of a sentence of six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 is only considered a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for the download (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a battle than to participate in the traffic of compact disks.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a three-month to one-year sentence (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and CD trafficking would involve a six-month to two-year sentence
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, under section 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films by authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the real thing then someone is exaggerating.
Article 4
My treating doctor spoke to me about one of his articles on strange research titled, 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less.'
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out through tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers observed that when the two people assumed they were getting the same paycheck, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion would require so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been implacably prosecuting war criminals in the Balkans for eight years since the public ministry of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed -, former general Ratko Mladic and former leader Serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic, are still in prison.
Their names are on this list whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'Carla's List' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York, who is prosecuting the criminals and prosecuting the criminals who have been raped.
What insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, involves significant expenses that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the driver's license, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange becomes responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in case of accident.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established by taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of driving licence, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
This is why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of accidents than their prudence.
Similarly, using census reports, companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
For this reason, the driver must carefully study the situation to choose the car insurance that best suits his or her profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, it offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 have to face various disadvantages at the time of signing a contract with an affordable insurance, as may be the low driving experience and the old age of the driver's license.
While the ideal for being well-insured is insurance at all risk, other more economical options exist.
The most anticipated drivers can opt for any risk insurance with franchise, so they get insurance coverage at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of contract implies that the customer pays a part of the amount of the sin.
“The portion of the amount of the damage that the customer will pay will be determined based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be low,” said Luis Noguera, Spain’s First Europa manager, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A advice.
If you are under the age of 25, try to be cautious and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the insurance price in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic fee that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses,” explains Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25, this becomes easier for drivers when signing a contract with insurance, as the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
This is why it is better to choose an all-risk insurance with a franchise.
"Young people can't normally enjoy the experience acquired before after an accident," said the director of the European company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, after the 'fear of the novice'.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is better that he negotiates insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest accident rate, because the increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a free-of-risk insurance (may be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
“They have a more relaxed drive and they have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchises,” judges Luis Noguera.
For retirees, insurance at all risk with franchise is preferable (when it is 150 euros), or extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, so it is essential to study the insurance that is most appropriate for us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth of the finals
The Milan AC and the Celtic Glasgow will be on their way to San Siro next Tuesday in search of what they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a zero match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six points, and who receives Benfica who does not pass four points.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan AC is due to compete in the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on December 13 this month looking for a place for the final on December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the null match at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although both teams will try to get out victorious, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning the final it would remain a better one in the octagon and crosses itself.
A defeat by Gordon Strachan’s team might be enough to rank if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn’t win, but she won’t be able to computer only on it because with nine points the game is back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won in the third straight (2-0).
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hopes of qualifying for the eighth of the final for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Until the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in the event that the Celtic would lose, to qualify for the eighth of the finals in order to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is the last and without opportunities to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, since the group disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before they started their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver.
Around 20,000 people have exhausted tickets to attend the concert which was the subject of a video in which is told the story of the band that became angry in the late 1990s.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that resumes their major hits as well as two new songs, ' Headlines ' and ' Voodoo ', which EMI releases in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls came on stage showing the bracelets that 'Posh Spice''s husband had offered them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the crowd filling GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Prior to the start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the show."
' Sporty Spice ', who was part of the group in 1998 "due to the differences between us" and which caused the group to dissolve two years later, also expressed its nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings changed, the feelings for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm happy to have made a decision," Chisholm said at the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been arranged and we appreciate each other a lot."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last showed up in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane of Virgin Airlines.
Upon their arrival at the airport, an army of baby sitters awaited them.
They have five sons and seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will be exhibited in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas issue between Russia and Ukraine is triggering an alarm.
A gas price dispute between Ukraine and Russia closed, thus increasing the risk of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by gas pipelines, and each pipeline is carefully monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase the transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two caused a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian-owned gas-providing monopoly company, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would mean for Ukraine a 40% increase in import costs from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all of our arguments during the talks, reminding us that we are a country that transits most of the gas,” Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters.
“The fluctuations in gas costs would undoubtedly be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused the disruption of supply of Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, resulting in an increase in prices.
Russian gas accounts for one-fourth of the EU’s supplies.
Russia has the largest gas reserves, although most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies of gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must monitor its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health must improve the controls to be carried out on its extra-Community employees to check if they have criminal records, the monitoring committee said.
The warning of the Auditor General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health does not have any specific data on the number of overseas people employed.
His report nevertheless highlighted other decisive checks, correctly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The Auditor General has carried out checks on extra-Community personnel following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor serving at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after dark with his jeep, in the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October, as suspected of being involved in various car bombing attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will need to carry out pre-employed checks on overseas personnel, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experience, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out checks on criminal records, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside the UK.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor-General's report now states that the committees are required to confront the Office of Criminal Past Control, thus allowing employers to undertake controls on various countries.
"While we have found that certain staff information has been well verified, it is not always done," the report said.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health is conducting most of the pre-employment checks he would make himself, but he also added: “Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure adequate information on some overseas staff members is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
"The report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities said they employed 1161 people from overseas, consisting mostly of doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor-General stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, in part because of problems relating to the identification of staff members with an indefinite term contract, who may or may not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current health authorities' inspection procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and pre-employment control system for staff members from overseas health services.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, allied with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment checks, and valid for all employees, including,
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the biopic on Joy Division’s latest singer, Ian Curts, has won 5 awards, including best film, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to the star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was engaged in the role of Curtis in the film, which is directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Madame Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal"
Daniel Craig, the Bond star, won the Variety award for allowing the British film to be under international reflectors.
The awards were distributed during the ceremony at London's Round House.
Control relates the success of Curtis with Joy Division, until her suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black and white film, which was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot with a budget of just <0x24>3 million.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first as best director and the second as best beginner.
Rock has also been awarded Best Documentary Award for the Julien Temple film on Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The award for best actor was given to Viggo Mortensen for his performance of the driver of a Russian mafia boss in the thriller based in London directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, renowned for his coriace character interpretations, won the Richard Harris Award for his remarkable contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old filmmaker, who has made films like Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award in honor of star Harris, starring in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to cinema,” he said.
“I’ve been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was admired in front of this great current actor, I was extremely honored.”
The independent film Oscars, better known as "The Bifas", are awarded by a jury of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and bosses include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia has revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells handling an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on ecclesiastical and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the missile smugglers' cells.
Al-Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following a failed Al Qaeda attack in 2006 against Abqaiq's largest oil site.
The newspaper citing a statement from the interior minister said 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 of the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of ecclesiastical and armed forces.
The government has asked the ecclesiastical leaders to do more against the Saudis headed in Iraq, to join al-Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and the Shiite Muslim government allied to the United States, considered hereditary by the hardline of the Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiastical leaders have collaborated with the authorities to support the royal family’s policy that dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by calls against the Saudi pro-Western government by Saudi leader Osama bin Laden, have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and power supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months," the spokesman for the interior ministry told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized into a “media cell” aimed at promoting “takfiri thought,” the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against unbelievers and apostates.
Among the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing the militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus has certainly been a pleasant planet to live.
Data from the European orbiting spacecraft showed that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, unlike previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation associated with slower rotation led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is waterless, devastated by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface hot enough to melt lead.
The findings of Venus Express, the European Space Agency's probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the potential future of Earth due to catastrophic climate change.
Fred Taylor, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, said: “We are beginning to understand why Venus’ climate is so different from that of Earth, even though the planets in them are virtually similar.
“Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that, billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, possibly even with a habitable surface.”
Uranium enriched seized by the police.
A kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people had been arrested and that the material was currently being analyzed.
It did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the merchandise would be worth <0x24>1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he wasn’t on top as a presidential candidate to answer a snowman’s questions.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates have finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have registered their questions submit them to candidates.
On Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as the one from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, questions and answers reflected much of the conditions of the Republican party, the candidate for the next election.
It is not known on what criteria, the CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest on a single topic, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the strongest topics for Republicans.
CNN has asked some voters to call when they hear funny things: The government has seen increases in approval when candidates speak out grossly.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who leads the major early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as New York mayor.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly ferocious when asked if they were willing to promote "amnesia" (providing regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have managed to deepen this issue.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, it may be due to the fact that they have begun to fight immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
In general, candidates, at least on immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, coupled with the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears of the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other topics were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in the content of the Bible in their entirety.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not about to believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, – in a pole position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – was not expected to declare that the death penalty is painful although necessary.
When we insisted on knowing if Jesus was in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to present himself in the election.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious search for grants conducted by Libertarian Ron Paul, and the sighs during Wednesday’s debate.
These two emerged from the bottomless pit, thanks to the fact that the two party defenders are unable to agree on who is the most well-known and more traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party in a timely and convincing way thanks to a message of success on American grandeur bringing the leaders closer together.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which he dims; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no juicy extra marital toe.
But here’s a revelation that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 (<0x24>1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle Gordon Brown would have fought well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister stepped back in his election draft, stupidly insulting British intelligence, declaring that polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown had transformed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The re-purchase of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on the edge of the crack, has shown a shortage of guidelines and a mediocre judgement in case of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against military spending cuts: they proclaimed that being a defense minister is for them a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of misguided donations on the part of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and his former chief of surveillance) made them resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don’t like politicians, and they don’t trust them, but they generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even rule for a long time, when he runs the risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the cabinets of ministers are balancing; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and with no more purpose.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he wished to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
Problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions taken when he was British Treasury Chancellor.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long investigation into the party’s funds “of cash for members of the House of Lords,” voters might think otherwise.
But Mr. Brown's difficult situation is not so tragic as it looks.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to realize Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies of always, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of politicians' big donors are clear, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, without knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the head of grant collection who spoke about doubtful donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests that he was aware of these moves, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival to the government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has made half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, resorting to an inquiry committee on the subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been broken, it's from the police spring.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Public Life Standards Committee, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the finances of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead him to renounce his particular financial relationship with the Confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter like Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to reconquer the voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate unwavering integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Will the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see snorkelling snorkelling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that credit card losses could reach <0x24>99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in costs and insolvency rates, which measures the non-recoverable or non-recoverable shares of the balance sheet, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took <0x24>1.4 billion in its consumer credits, in part due to the weakness of cardholders.
It’s still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historic average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in U.S. law in 2005 on personal bankruptcy caused a sudden drop in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of records (and therefore insolvency rates) could increase even if conditions of bankruptcy were met.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly indebtedness that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of broadcasting for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct link of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exists: consumers may prefer to increase their debts now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flows than to the value of the assets, and therefore the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily result in a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to credit securities issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority to repay the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This, in theory, should reduce the risk of a rapid resumption of actions.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all loans,” said Gary Perlin, CEO of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a consequent decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Be careful of the back rows.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who had to go testify their roles in relation to a fraud committed by Enron’s former financial director, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially declared themselves innocent of the seven allegations of alleged fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to get rich despite their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout the UK due to two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, their case remains a matter pending for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 led Fastow to understand that he was the subject of a government investigation into Enron's debacle.
The allegations against the bankers, nicknamed the "Natwest threes," claimed to have come to Houston in 2000 to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, who helped him trick bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest from the subsidiary bank for <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The bankers paid <0x24>250,000 to Kopper as interest for this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow had falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay <0x24>20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth these <0x24>20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the allegations, the bankers would have earned <0x24>7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned <0x24>12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endured a six-year prison sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released after paying a <0x24>1 million bail each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously the seventh largest national company, in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debts or even offer its bidon speculations as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of dismissals, more than <0x24>60 billion in market value losses and more than <0x24>2 billion in losses for retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former President-General Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of the company.
Skilling has been sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were overturned because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
Not in Moscow, not in Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without a stopover from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at <0x24>54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
“Even if no one really needs so many seats, because it’s more of a family-use aircraft or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires’ Salon, an orgy of consumer stimulation, for four days, which is held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to stir the interest of the new wealthy Russians for their diverse products, ranging from acajou yachts to diamond-filled cars such as 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer scrutinized a bright orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second-largest private jet market.”
“Thanks to a boom in oil, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas.”
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 70s, the Japanese in the 90s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s largest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth <0x24>282 billion, according to Forbes listing the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the wealth is made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires worth a total of <0x24>670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank reported that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all there,” said Nicole Marais, a spokeswoman for Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She participated in the fair for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Soho’s Jewelry Group.
“Women are all well-prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the living room, on Sunday night, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare to be as their clients, millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Melle Yumatova, who was wearing a high-seam dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The salon seems primarily aimed at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to do the queue in the lids to come up to an immense warehouse where are exhibited Cadillac Escalades, platinum canyons, Mövenpick ice creams, our billiard tables and customized pellets apartments.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (<0x24>44.57).
“Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal Dutch porcelain factory stand Delf, in front of a mural of Raimbrand on blue tiles, handmade.
"It is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers said here that Russians with old capital (10-15 years old are too old according to Russian standards) have already switched from shiny logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the fair.
In spite of this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaires or tourists, are looking for the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he had sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton embedded with gold yarns.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the director of sales of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with last cry alarm systems, also said he sold to a Russian millionaire, the bright orange Porsche, for <0x24>170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, for <0x24>55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs <0x24>22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of oak leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will definitely keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’d already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more than you might think.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company has erected four stands representing British telephone cabins, filled with mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karriev, the company’s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire fair.
Passengers stopped to launch lots of tickets, asking their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this fake wealth or poking a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unauthorized Surgeon Suspected of Homicide in New Jersey
It was the eve of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston was looking through the glass bay of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and observing an ambulance that had just stopped at the White Cape Cod gate on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stopping,” Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's where I realized that someone had died.
Authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture executed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, which the police have not yet identified, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo’s death, but they are confident that the results of toxicological tests will take time, but should allow for the mysterious death that has saddened Newark police seniors.
Melle Arroyo has been the Assistant Director of Police, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker, and hardworking,” McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a phone interview on Wednesday.
“It was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done anything to protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons, aged 14 and 11, as well as a granddaughter.
Eileen Walsj, a spokesman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine whether Mlle Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgery.
“This is an opportunity to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
Authorities said they arrived at her house at about 3:00 p.m.
and found Melle Arroyo on the couch.
She was declared deceased.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh could not confirm whether Melle Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to understand if a part of the house was used as a medical cabinet.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Melle Castro’s home where a fanned rosemary rested in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian was barking in the back.
A blue pot called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, was poured into a hangar, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two all-terrain bikes hanged on the sides.
McCarthy said that since her arrival in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Mlle Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandoning her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and again when I left.
“It was embarrassing.”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower the rates associated with the effervescence of the global stock market.
Shares exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would try to calm credit conditions, subsequently lowering interest rates promoted by the US central bank’s vice president’s calming statements.
Stock markets explode in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, president of the Federal Reserve, said those who decide must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their shares in the agitated financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure the irritable markets given these new credit-related tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulence has partially “inverted some improvements in the functioning of the market in late September and October.
In the event that this harsh turbulence would persist, it would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that subsequent interest rate drops could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news on the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil have been accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will fire 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the losing bets of the impru.
Only 20 jobs are planned in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average increased by 331 points, or 2.55% ending to 13.289.40, while the biggest index, S&P 500, increased by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points or 2.7% to 6306.2 adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3%.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit difficulties in markets was highlighted as a result of the strong demand for a sale of monthly tri-fund auctions by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the FED and the ECB and inject subsequent funds into London's financial markets causing credit tensions has caused the monthly "Libor" lending rates to British banks, causing their highest growth since November 6 to 6,9 per cent.
England faces a call for judgment against critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are facing two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 drummer for England at Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more importantly, in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the President of the Selectors who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President General of England, begins to fill out a national timeline to become a candidate.
The one who won’t win the No. 6 backsard will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is too.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to get to the top of his profession while another will never get beyond the lower level, sometimes by lack of luck more than by lack of skill.
It is not just cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time to get Bopara out?
Is it fair compared to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee “tubby”?; both, new executives who have earned good diplomas, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless they give him at least one chance?
The numbers have their importance in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricketer one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full form and continued to practice.
Anderson took 32 first-class goals in 33 laps to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
Whether it's Shah or Bopara who will play at Asgiriya Stadium, it's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and succeeded well in the first, with five goals and 40 useful turns, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer under the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double-stroke was still against the 100 A.
The probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start at the 88 Test innings in Bombay, 32 cents first-class versus six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah only made ten rounds during his two innings against the Caribbean in May during the Test at Lord, his Middlesex player town, and that, the immediate rejection by the teams when Vaughan is back in shape, claiming his place for the next game, seems to have afflict his boymba so vivid efforts.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing frightened him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently landed on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, England’s sponsor.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, although the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching him from a distance, to ask him if he had seen this.
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his shiny allure allows him to do the services that go to him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could this be the real art of selection?
I would be willing to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, it will be him who will play this weekend.
The buses bring people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, throwing out these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hoped the city would return to normal.
Some have come back to fight the militants who have removed them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people in Damascus transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
“They say that the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated area of Amariyah, returned home with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-aided militia had allowed him to chase Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him to return home.
One of Jordan’s newcomers is the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after it encouraged citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.”
"That's why I'm coming home today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many say they have been attracted by the growing calm of the capital since U.S. troops arrived, and in view of continuing training of well-armed “citizen groups” and collaborating with U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say they were forced to return due to the visa problem and the decadence of the capital Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three children, expressed suspicion that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to restrict the entry of people into the country.
More than two and a half million people have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
“We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” said Sunni retired.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decline in violence may be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were expelled from Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring fighting back.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in terms of vocational training, and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, for the 50th time, I explained to a non-Sarrois that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-deception, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of the Sarre, which is ranked fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, high schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies there with a double or even triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high level of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the country's children to higher schools in a higher than average number - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
“In Sarre, we take advantage of the professional training system,” says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in training at IW.
More than one in five young people earn their degree in a professional school, so the Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
Due to the number of inhabitants, the double-course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one-third in recent years.
That's why the Ministry of Education of Sardinia has forced higher education to a marketing campaign in the engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout the federal state.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of nursery is free of law - a model that in the meantime other federal states copy as well.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether students’ performance is improving sustainably.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the number of at-risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Sarre has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are getting better.
And in spite of the Saroes, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise points could be gained in this area.
Because the neighbor's language is mandatory in high schools - even if Sarrois are not French.
Chávez Rules the Watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon do tic-tac differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will bring up the half-hour chronometer in the South American country.
Chavez became a cartoonist in Spain.
As the official Venezuelan newspaper reported, due to a new law, the clocks will be set in less than four and a half hours of the universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, as a result of a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe would remain president of Colombia, he would not have any relations either with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
“I can’t, already just because of my dignity,” Chávez said, rushing to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger of this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw to Chávez the mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe had “cracked Venezuela’s face” with this decision, Chávez criticised Sunday.
In Spain, Chávez is also in every mouth.
A new mobile phone ringtone is raging in the country: “Why don’t you shut up” is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by King Juan Carlos of Spain who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was annoyed by the constant interpellations of left-wing populists and told him to shut up.
A decline in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjunction, according to a forecast, a real under-value of the wage threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to see a real decline in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
“The fault lies with the low wage development, the increase in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices,” said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Conjunctional Research.
New charges could also be incurred with respect to the employee's unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected 3.3 percent drop in unemployment insurance for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the SPD politician.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion in food prices and hydrocarbons had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3.0 percent from one year to the next.
Venus is the Earth's hell twin.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like Earth than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbulence at the poles, similar to those that appear on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that there are flashes on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" today brought evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: lightning flashes on Venus explode at an altitude of about 56 kilometres of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in "The Magazin in Los Angeles".
According to the famous theory of cyprin, lightning would have made life on Earth appear: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: “If there was life, it must have been at a very ancient date in history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be little living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes with temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the hellish twin on Earth, but it remains a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of Venus Express in November 2005 was an important step in Venus research, as no more probes were on the way to exploring the planet since the 1980s.
According to the researchers, the latest research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the points in common with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than were supposed at first.
Thus, in addition to the wind turbulence already known at the north pole, the researchers found a cloud turbulence at the south pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth's hemispheres in winter, wrote a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spatiale and Cosmic Physics.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet classified as a night or morning star orbits the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns on itself much more slowly: a Venetian day lasts 243 days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, barely recalls Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
On both, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has fixed itself on Earth in the form of carbonate, it constitutes most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler calls for the end of the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellor.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for the attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and sums up the large coalition of chlorine the dispute over the welcome of the Dalai Lama.
“We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue,” Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the welcome of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensible foreign policy balance, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against the accusations that it would organize a new China policy.
The German Chancellor has not taken her distance from the traditional policy of a single China.
“China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the Dalai Lama’s reception and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier complained in particular about the CDU's "forward policy" in foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's reception at the Chancellor's office, virulent irritations were felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only dismissed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to the Spiegel, also froze the dialogue said of the foreign ministers of the two countries' strategy.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the Dalai Lama’s reception was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in its official functions, Wen Jiabao thus supported the Chinese position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama would show that it is trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, which also includes other present-day provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fighting with police, shooting, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be implemented so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in the streets by violence, the German Interior Minister demanded.
Burning barricades, crackers shooting at the police with hunting rifles: after the severe uprisings of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We need to make sure that a social explosive does not become a form of violence in our home too.
We must take this seriously,” he told the “New Press” published in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to get out of it with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federal states and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This will not only affect the integration of immigrants.
“From integration summits to conferences on Islam, this shows its first successes.”
However, it would be too early for an end to an alert.
Schäuble points out, at the same time as in the German suburbs, that there are no sociological or urban problems as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police over the past nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings burned down.
This is what the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded of greater efforts to integrate the German government.
Taking into account the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would still be a need for action.
Kolat stresses that the proportion of unemployed young people under the age of 25 from immigration would be higher than the average.
First and foremost, there should be more room for training.
Kolat insisted: “We must give young people a perspective.”
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration also don’t want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, “But we still have to be careful.”
“Youths should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.”
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter flew over the area with projectors.
Postal authorities reported three arrests as well as a few cars and garbage.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces ensures calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the town.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 policemen were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the disturbances overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a car accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the prosecution's early findings, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the Angela Merkel empire.
The chancellor’s entry into the utopian scene shows that the coalition ended it with the bottom – and there’s nothing more to expect from her.
In which country does the Chancellor live right?
After her disappointing intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that should ultimately be governed by it.
The accusation of focusing too much on politics has been pushed back by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It’s provincial, she said, and showed only by there that she doesn’t want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it has made everyone aware of the exact extent of this accusation.
There was neither concrete interest nor little feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a weighing politician, who runs into foreign policy and even stays in the vicinity.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, she again and again welcomes the agreements of Heiligendam, but does not say how climate goals will be achieved in our country.
Even, the praise of itself - having so little modesty, the CDU leader would have refused it even two years ago.
Now it cramps itself into all-made formulas, that growth would touch people.
It destroys her image of a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional phrases for that.
In this regard, the number of times she makes lapses when it comes to family allocation is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a half-accurate phrase.
It sits on unknown ground, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Branch Attack
In the Youtube debate of Republican presidential candidates, both favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney face a tough offensive battle – and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already exploding on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refuge for clandestines," Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
The former governor of Massachusetts was accused of employing unpapered immigrants, and the former governor of Massachusetts responded by saying, “I would say his own house was a haven for clandestine people.”
Candidates are on the offensive: as the Republican base also has no official favors, the eight presidential candidates use CNN debates first and foremost to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are barely more than fans.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power," McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also vigorously taught by Vietnamese veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign range from time to time beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Common Room in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are denied, applause moves into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites are once again revealed.
“I made a mistake at the time,” Romney said, apologizing to the base and the television audience for having been a supporter of abortion in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani passes into a flowing node when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigned as a civilian for the first time.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
Thus, eight years of military domination ended.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was invested for a new five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and to act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his post of chief of the army to his trustee Ashfaq Kiyani and thereby plunged to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after he took power by a bloodless putsch, the former general now reigns for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By retiring from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on November 3.
Already shortly after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus meet another requirement from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers in his ranks, rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the tribal area of northern Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghan border.
Krautrock's dads are back.
The German supergroups of the 1970s rejoined: the three members of the Harmonia group again took their console at a concert in Berlin.
For their return, recordings of their great hit "Live 1974" appeared.
Already at that time, they were much more known abroad.
The intended sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced at the evening poster.
Each has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle of a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old boy who owns a laptop and a guitar.
To the right, watched by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, among others even a beat.
And sometimes this is inadvertently added to a piece of traditional music.
It does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that Harmonia is playing again has provided some emotion among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to disclose it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name reason in the collective memory of the pop, but in no way in such a lasting way that this group has been so painfully missing for 32 years.
But why would the German not also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the 1970s?
Especially since what is mistakenly called "Krautrock" has always rained more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, the room saw the questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in pan-gyrical praise, the surprise had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory is already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and that during this period, the power of impact felt was much lower than what was subsequently assigned to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the basement below the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly settled in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile in the Forests of Weserbergland.
There, in a former Weser farm, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Commune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tortured as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
In the garbage there was a fan of the choral Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many kept Harmonia away from it.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered from material misery.
The harvest of the dead wood was not for himself alone in search of himself.
The CD "Live 1974" that just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as well as someone who thinks to remember.
Rother emitted at that time the desire to force Harmonia to practice from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and secured his existence with albums such as "Flame Hearts".
Cluster revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe Griessem's live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its label Greenland set the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as a German intrinsic contribution to contemporary music.
New! had already been removed on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of Cultures of the World in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of Krautrock influence would be determined with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase flies in the room amidst the singular sounds: “The only true music, you listen to the future.”
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the room of the farm.
The projections of other black and white images of bazaar wired tools are used to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are once again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and to the battery, to pull out the instruments of unprecedented sounds thanks to the self-built effects instruments.
Nowadays, electronic music resembles electronic music.
All three of the major technicians.
Even the choir of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we crawl and whistle under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought after in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the leakage of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is now no longer annoyed by it.
But what goes best for you will be covered carefully on the stage.
Where does music start and where does it end?
This can tap on someone’s nerves (?) or give away fugitive moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Killer Peace", two films address the Balkan War again.
But the two don't convince.
Either the projects rely too much on action and on the nonsense shooting exchanges or on the contrary they are too lamentable.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news is that the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but that’s where, in the back country of the Bosnian war, actor Richard Gere is found.
Lastly, we had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many cute and futile roles in women-feeling films and too many press conferences on the topic of Buddhism made her eager to show up.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch "The Hunting Party" anyway - when the hunter becomes the hunter (why should today's films be as long and confused as collective locomotive driver conventions?)
He delivers a magnificent depiction full of eyebrows: at the bottom, his character as a war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has long spent his best moments behind him, but who has left himself in his backyard, even as old as a monument.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with German production "Killer Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless sequel to films missed on the Balkan War.
“Killer peace” can be quickly processed: the film tells of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from the Kosovo francs, in which one of the two falls in love.
While it is welcome that Serbians are not presented here for once as the sole cause of all evils, this film as flat as a television film is lost too quickly in the action and the exchange of nonsense shots.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can look at the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why there has never been a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioned to track down the high war criminal "The Frog", might have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both at the same time Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go on small teams in the forest, to accomplish something that the military can’t do and for both males, it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you simply don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as he introduced us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian assassinated later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, achieves that NATO, the CIA and all the prize hunters of the world have failed in five years: catching the criminal of war just for a slap and the slap.
It is so bad that the International Court of Justice of the Hague should be seized of crime against cinematic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects Americans and French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt in a sufficiently intensive manner due to secret political agreements.
But the good and the bad are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionately, I see the front veins swollen, clearly: how tired it is to be evil."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tummy heads, but they suggest how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been any good movies about South Africa before.
What’s worth every time: when a star draws on a crisis home or on a minefield, it comes out something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arquette, “Jenseits go Grenzen” with Angelina Jolie or “Blutdiamanten” with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
In any case, it’s still decades before Hollywood can make a good holocaust film with “Schindler’s List.”
Some movies still have to ripen - those who today value classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have never been unanimously celebrated at their time as masterpieces.
But maybe today we know too much about the conflicts of the world, where every hecatombe comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And that ravished the writers the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Dictator" have actually become as good as well because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don’t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have a sarcastic and distant artistic look at the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "The Lemprier Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It only depends on the fact that some things never change."
"The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrible way, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust raises criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The resignation of the mayor with Hamburg's nomination for the Summer Olympics has hit politics and the economy with virulent criticism.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games on the waterfront.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of opportunities.
The chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday an abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
Recently, no other project had deployed as much motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
“Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures.”
Schmidt-Trenz calls on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new, longer-term starting point, "which takes as starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his previous statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It's not Hamburg who decides on a nomination for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December, regarding Munich’s nomination for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means to us that, in the time we had planned until 2028, we will have no chance.”
However, the dream does not belong definitively to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust’s statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to run for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
Abandonment of the nomination would be further inconsistent with the statements of the head of the Senate at the plenary meeting of the German Federation of Higher Sports Schools.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's candidacy at the 2015 Universiade as "not a substitute" at the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Sports Schools had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD fraction of the mayor blamed the Senate for not using this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grasbrook has been denied by the Senate for years because it played the Olympic card and ruled out the construction of housing," SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD has always demanded for the Little Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and a later use of housing, the CDU would have focused exclusively on the "Event factor".
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg, for its part, would have raised great enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, broke against Leipzig.
It's not Warhols' boxes.
He who connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
A large part of the eighty "Type Stockholm" Brillo-Boxes listed there are counterfeit.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 circo-boxes a few months ago, the internal researches of the Moderna Museum in Stockholm lead today to a disenchanting result - one of which is a great one of the "Cents of the world, made of the 1995 'Brillo-Boxes': the six "Brillo-Boxes of the Modern" part.
The ancient history is enclosed, a deconcertant chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes, based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powder soap boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were also not exhibited at the Moderna Museum.
Witnesses of the time now speak of about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have been legally entered into the history of art and auctions, as authorised Andy Warhol's Original Brillo-Boxes, under the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than <0x24>100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum mistakenly claimed later that about a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then be handed over to him.
In fact, the 105 boxes of Hultén were produced in Malmö only in 1990, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that date, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, head conservator of the Moderna Museum, examined, besides the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Swedish private collections, of which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed with a white apple and pinned with a pink print.
The texture of the copies dating back to 1990, on the contrary, reveals that the painting was directly applied without a layer of background on the laminated panels, using a paint roll - moreover, it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board''s 'Cause of the Arts' in New York, so will be the decision of the Mux'sesse in the other Modern class.
Already in July, the Authentication Board of course announced that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
But since then there has been an inexorable silence.
The rebels in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers abandon, the same ones who had retreated to a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the president for corruption and election fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
Loyal soldiers in power had just before attacked the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been interspersed in the building for hours.
Approximately half of them stood in court on Wednesday because of a failed putsch attempt in 2003 - among them Trillans.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse with about 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen, who were normally supposed to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favor and had joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal troops in power looped the sector around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough of it," Trillannes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who was in command of the Elite Unit of the Scout Rangers, said other units of the army would soon join the march.
Critics of the regime called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila has been the theater of the attempted mutiny of some 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurgency broke out almost 24 hours after the army refused to join it.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14.46, as the company said on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a ransom.
The option would remain open to further increase the participation in Versatel.
This move is aimed at accelerating the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, it is said in the market.
Yesterday, United Internet had already acquired nearly 10 percent stake in the mobile phone company Drillish.
As part of a capital increase, Drillish has listed 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
United Internet purchased 5.15 million for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.1 million.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile telephony products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesman said.
The two companies founded the joint-stock company MSP in order to absorb the Freenet competitor.
At the moment, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent participation at Freenet, and not use their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
The two companies, however, would leave all the options open, in particular to increase participation in the Freenet SA, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
Poker still hard to predict on Freenet, which has lasted for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers linked to a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet and Drillish Holding had a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It has now been agreed that Drillish will bring about an additional four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
