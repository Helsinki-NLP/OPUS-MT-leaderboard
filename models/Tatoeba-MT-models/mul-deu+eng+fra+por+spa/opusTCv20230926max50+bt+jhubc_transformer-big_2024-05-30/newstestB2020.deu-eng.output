Fire extinguished in a French chemical plant
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. This was reported by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire erupted at night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was on the run with about 200 Lögen.
The fire could be stopped.
Anrainers were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are manufactured. The factory is part of the company sobrisogenet, the lubrizol was the safety of the US-Milliard.
About 400 people work at the plant. In the past, the chemical factory already provided headlines - for example, when in 2013 a leak developed the gas methanthiol and the surrounding area was heavily polluted by faul eggs. In 2015, after an operational accident, about 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the wastewater system in the city.
Woman Announces Her Job to Search for Her Missing Dog for 57 Days
For two months, a Washington-based woman searched for her missing dog - and for this, she additionally cancelled her job. Border Collie, a seven-year-old, had been removed from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. For 57 days, the dog was missing any trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left dog Katie in the hotel room while they were going to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thursday's dog was in panic
In the hope that Katie might stay somewhere else in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door has been opened.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But from days to weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake", which announced her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The Tears Flow"

We were looking for the neighborhood and suddenly she was flying away. T. they hadn't stopped her dog, they "wouldn't let me go, I just hugged her.
Losses in the Bundeswehr: machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The remainder is in most cases unclear. The opposition speaks of a "terrifying" extent.
Weapons and ammunition have disappeared repeatedly in the Bundeswehr - many of them without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has suffered the loss of 39 weapons, 39 pieces of weapons and almost 20,000 ammunition. This is evidenced by a list of the Federal Ministry of Defence classified as a covert issue.
According to the paper from the office of the Secretary of State of Defence Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one piece of weapon and 3474 gun ammunition have reappeared so far. The still missing weapons and pieces of weapons are four weapons of the type MG3, six of the type GGh3, six of the machine guns of the type MGh3, one of the Tyhtol.
The extent of the gun and ammunition losses in the Francz were found in the Bundeswehr was "horrible", said the left-wing member of the Bundestag Martina Renner. This was all the more true, as in the course of the investigations, Muzitl was hardly found to have been recovered.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves Iranian port
More than two months after his arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship monitoring data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and was given to the Iranian port of Raraten. When the port of destination was left in Emihael.
The tanker was actually released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters, and the shipping company said it wanted to wait for an official announcement from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was charged on July 19 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the sea route of Hormuz with violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran had been detained in the face of the disputed, temporary arrest of an Iranian oil tanker in response to Britain's response.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the seas. The tensions in the region have increased immensely in recent months. The trade shipping has increased between the United States and the United States.
Merkel respects the courage of the people in the peaceful revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the commitment of the people in the DDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the peaceful revolution. In the fall of 1989, brave citizens had stifled the then DDR regime, Merkel said during a rally at the party of the Thuringian CDU-Fraktion to the German parliament.
Musk sets delivery record
Tesla Quartal may keep a record, but despite the delivery boom, there have been losses in the electric car group.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk gave his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk’s circulars said. The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customer. To do this, Tesla will have to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked it: Tesla’s shares went out of trading with a plus of over six percent. So strong the price has not moved in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be produced in the current and coming quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom.
Mystery Solved: That's Why We Can't Kiss Ourselves
A kind of braking in the brain prevents people from sneezing themselves. This was found by scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday night. While only progress has been made on the question, why do children go so far as to fight the Ki so hard?
Finally, it has also been shown why approaching a whispering hand alone triggers laughter before touching. This lies on a deep layer in the brain, which already triggers laughter when waiting for the whispering.
Previous research has shown that rats with "laughing" in the ultrasound area react when they are squeezed by humans. This "laughing" is conveyed by the part of the brain that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch
So far it has been assumed that the brain can differentiate between self-touch and touch by others - which is why humans can't chill themselves. However, in the experiments on rats, the researchers found that laughter has become unpleasant, as well as the activity of the subject area of the brain itself, even if the brain's brains are unpleasant.
But if you pass the self-touch and the touch of others at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat’s brain can’t distinguish between self-touch and the touch of others. The new findings suggest that the people can’t get close to a large cell in the brain itself.
The rats were also trained to kitzel on their own. In the experiment, they sometimes broke this initiation early, showed escape behavior or horror. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of children. The ambivalence of kitzel is a reaction similar to that of rats and humans.
Catastrophe: Great fire wiped out in French chemical plant
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. The Normandy prefecture told AFP on Friday that the fire had erupted in the night of Thursday.
According to the authorities, no substances that endanger health should be released. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The firefighter was on the run with about 200 lögensch.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes, buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to Lubrizol company by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The plant belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly stringent safety requirements. Around 400 people work in the plant.
The chemical factory already provided headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 a leak developed the gas methanthiol and the environment was widely smelled of faul eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city’s sewage system.
Brexit: Johnson Criticized by His Own Sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first meeting in Parliament after the lifting of the forced pause on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country on October 31 without an agreement from the EU, but Brussels should not accept his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement.
Speaking about Cox, who had advocated for Britain’s stay in the European Union, the prime minister said: “The best way to honor Jo Cox’s memory and make this country one again would be to carry out the EU’s withdrawal.” Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Reminder of the attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a memorial to the victims will be unveiled on Saturday in Norway. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: die Eisenrosenen) consists of about 1,000 iron rose sculptures. They are reminiscent of the Anlogen in the Roses of the Taudens.
The project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will now be unveiled in the same place - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims.
On July 22, 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first ignited a car bomb in the Oslo government district and subsequently shot down dozens of participants in a holiday camp on the island of Utöya of the youth organisation of the Social Democratic Workers Party.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" detained in Iran was able to get back into the sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" detained in Iran since mid-July is back in international waters. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, according to the shipping company Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now flying to Dubai for medical examinations, Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell said. By noon the ship left the Iranian waters. "Glad it's over," he told Swedish TV.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law," it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker on July 19 under the charge of failing to comply with the regulations of maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members had to work together professionally quickly, keeping them in check according to the circumstances and keeping their family in check, said Siennell.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar following the arrest of the "Stena Impero": there was a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, placed on the chain in early July.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Mutual measures, it was a trade deal to get rid of the "Stena Empire", London vehemently rejected.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the seas. The tensions in the region have increased tremendously in recent months. The trade ships between the United States and the United States have become more intercontinental.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans are plaguing the Iranian leadership to want to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects that. The United States was withdrawn from the international nuclear deal in 2018 alone, which was supposed to prevent Iran from joining a nuclear bomb, and at the same time the U.S. economy and its economy.
Due to the dispute over the “Stena Impero” and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of the trading ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the road of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran wanted to join the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protectorates for the security of the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
In view of the criminal charges imposed by President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, the government of the United States has forced foreign producers in the People's Republic to re-dispose themselves of a country that is not a global leader, but a global leader of Asian companies that considers their product to be a leader in the United States.
But now India itself is in the focus of Trump. From Haudegen in the White House devalued as "Kingdom of Customs", America has withdrawn the trade advantages for 2000 products in early June. The US is viewing India prohibitively high tariffs, and demanding a better market value for other cars.
On the world map of trade wars, the ties with India are obviously just a by-the-counter spot. America also considers the world’s largest democracy through its security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China’s claims of power in the South Indian Ocean, against India, against India, and against America’s backdrop of security.
However, the problem lies in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development is a difficult one in the Socialist Republic of India. Even among modes. Its reformist now aims to quickly address the bureaucratic irresponsibility of the many peoples and to keep them in the wrong state.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, in India, in the first five years of the mode, a lot has turned to the better. But in trade policy, this does not apply. Of these, internationally inspiring companies are not so competitive as to target new foreigners.
In the West, the modes of the nimbus of the energetic reformer depends on the economically radically renewing of his country. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister is too well aware of what western managers are saying.In the core, the "India First" and the "First" will become the "First" Advocate."
Conquest of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to be buried in Paris next week, according to a report. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the cemetery of Montparnasse in the south of the French capital.Instead, the AFP news agency was reported to have a family called the family.
Targeted to the competitor: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships
The world’s top has long been in the target, but in the cooled-down Khalifa International Stadium, the heart-warming scenes were still taking place. In the first run of the men over 5,000 meters, Jonathan Busby started to swing down the road dangerously. He could barely stand up to the target, and the sun was still on the beacons.
"I just wanted to help him here. Everyone in this situation would have said that he was going to do the same thing," said Dabo normal after the race in the Mixed Zone, when he was completely unexpectedly attracting the attention of the gathered journalists on me. he just whispered to me. he just said. he didn't want to talk about his heroinity at all.
He did this in the evening with emphasis - and much more intensely than he thought. Because this heroinetat will remain in memory. Because Dabo left his competitor Busby even the lead in the goal and voluntarily did not take the last place of the end of the world. It only took the end of the Seufeut - by the way, it took the last place of the world, with this good five minutes of the barepite, the <0xC3><0x84>thi.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, joined to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. Although according to official data, he was disappointed with 18:10.87 minutes, he himself was still disappointed: "I just didn't want to run at 17:55 minutes. Best time was at least 18 minutes".
Million Masks: Egyptians Get Ready for Wild Protest Day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible government-critical protests. On Friday, an increased police presence was observed in the center of Cairo. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
Already in the past days, the police had reinforced their road checks and partially searched pedestrian phones for news and photos related to the protests, hundreds of which had been arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, however, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, it appeared to have come to protests with hundreds of participants, but they turned against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who accused the critic of corruption and mismanagement.The critics of the moham, who accused the Facebook of "braunting a country with such an open protest against the political leadership, had not given it in the years in Egypt.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise, according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) had more than 1,570 arrests on Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization have not been able to respond to these cases.
Arrests arbitrary
Many people have been "voluntarily arrested" "just because they were 'at the wrong time in the wrong place'," HRW informed the detainees, citing lawyers, but the charges against the detainees range from the fact that their lawyers have been detained.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country, blocking Cairo’s websites and online services to block further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Shipping dealers should be able to give returns more easily
For online retailers, many parcels are lost. Around 20 million returns land on the trash. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando how they can donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While companies could not be exempted from sales tax on donations of goods, the ministry said on a question from the Greens-Federal faction, about which the newspapers of the Funke-Medien-Gruppe reported on Friday. However, traders could use the market value of the unsold returns.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the German citizens would send back every six packages on the Internet when ordering. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the trash. They would donate to the companies, according to the current legal situation, a rate of interest, then additional money to the revenues, then the revenues, etc.
Green Group chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify that companies can evaluate non-sales products accordingly and donate to non-profit organizations free of charge. The companies should not rely only on the market until they can be paid for the other, also for the online donation.
Banksy Art at Auction: There Has Never Been A Better Time To Sell This Painting
Streetart-Star Banksy's famous work, "Devolved Parliament", is due to be sold soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work emphasizes "the reshaping of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the UK capital until it will be sold on October 3. It will be sold at 1.5 million to two million.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the southwestern part of the UK, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-exposed the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the "Parliament" was renamed the work, which formerly "Devolente" in "Devolente"
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had delivered a hard-hit with the opposition at the first sitting of the House of Commons after the Supreme Court suspended a forced pause by Johnson. Johnson wants the Brexit, which has been postponed twice on October 31, even without a deal with the EU.
This is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in southeast England, he painted a picture depicting a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a knife. The work is seen daily in Verreerete the richness of thousands of Lk<0xC3><0xB8>r and others in Köaher.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's violent verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, compared to the 2016 election campaign ahead of the Brexit referendum, the current controversy we are going to be a "walking in the park" (we are going to be confronted with the EU's "passion in the park," said Dominic Cummings at the outset.
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them of "trafficking" among others, alleging that he could put MPs at risk because they could become targets of murder threats, he dismissed as "humbug".
Cummings said the only way to restore peace would be if the MEPs finally respected Britain's decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were upset that Britain still did not leave the EU three years after the referendum.
Faced with the uplifted mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect to each other," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the UN plenary.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said at the UN General Debate in New York on Friday. "If it goes bad, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations should have blamed the "Katers for our responsibility.
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of which around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India was part of the Spashmir region of the Kashmir region.
Not even a bottle of water
Protesters in Cairo demand the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
In response to the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. With sharp ammunition it shoots the population, more than 2,000 detainees gather in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners already inmates there. Protesting in Egypt was an approximate time of the year, as in 2013.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, hopelessness and the feeling of being drowned by the own government drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi has not been able to handle, no matter how hard it is against Diesa Wider.
Nowadays, one third of the world's old oil market has lived below the poverty line. Since 2016, the world's currency has always lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is at ten percent. In fact, in the supermarket, if you want to buy more than one bottle of water, you have to decide who you're going to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola, or the military.
T<0xC3><0x9C>V tests at the terminal: BER-Chef: No more "showstopper" for capital airport
Two months ago, it was checked to see if the complex plant splitting in BER fire protection works in synergy. The operators are satisfied with the progress, but the turf is not yet finished at BER.
After extensive Tüv inspections at the terminal of the future capital airport, operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year, this is certain, said supervisory board chief Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the supervisory board.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful test, but also said there are still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many details, but we don't have a real show stopper." He assured that the schedule until the start-up still contained buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve is no longer expected to be too large. The construction completion indicator is now due to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year it was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of shortcomings in power cables are still to be corrected; the T<0xC3><0xB8>v wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the commencement of the flight operation, there is still a need to work intensively on addressing the shortcomings," it said in a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there is a lack of evidence, less new cables. There is also no release for all the dunes on which the cable trams hang. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal still does not work satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke cutters, which will run down in a fire like a canvas. It should not be spread out under the engine gas. It will not have to spread under the new fire.
Problems with fire protection and other building defects as well as planning errors delay the opening of the airport for years. Originally it was supposed to be in operation in 2011. Costs have increased from two billion since the start of construction in 2006 to an estimated 6.5 billion euros for next year.
As the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the operators are planning to expand the airport, which is why it is expected to attend a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on October 18, as announced by the chairman of Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new CEOs. Finance manager Heike Fölster is switching to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, staff manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has fixed the airport finances.
Chemnitz: Drug vending machines exploded - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and for that he chased several vending machines in the Chemnitz area! Now the perpetrator is finally in prison!
In the last two years, the number of explosive cigarette and parking ticket vending machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply.
After two detonations at the end of May, police arrested a 33-year-old German on the Civil Road and Further Road in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations for carrying out explosive explosions in a unit of action with particularly serious theft conducted by the Chemnitzer criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old confirmed itself."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now witnessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman said: "With the confiscation, he has apparently financed his addiction to narcotics." Only four times the bomber had blasted parking ticket machines on the street between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage incurred is at least 60 000 euros!
The automaton bomber is now in custody, and the police investigations against him continue.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further machine guns in Chemnitz and neighbouring districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the price struggle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA "represents the commercial control over" of all Eurowings flights from Vienna, confirmed by a statement on Friday.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa airline Eurowings will thus be dissolved de facto. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel.f. will be renamed as Eurowings personnel.In Salzburg, the Eurowings will be renamed by Germany, and will be renamed the three of the Eurowings.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA rotary cross and network planning, the spokesman said. The flight times will be adjusted on connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the rotary cross Vienna and on the other hand, to exit decentralized traffic from the Bundesländer.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings serves in Vienna only as a "Production Company" for the sister group AUA. Thus, among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but not primarily with Eurowings device. The aircraft should be equipped with the A. Terfere A. The aircraft should be fitted to the Euro-Augmented number A.
A price fight broke out at the Vienna airport after the Niki-pleite. Ryanair's daughter Laudamotion announced only on Thursday that the fleet will be loaded into 16 aircraft in Vienna next summer. The Irish low-cost airline will send four Ryanair jets as a carrier, such as "Kryontleung", which will be shipped to Wiesen and the crews in case of Wiws.
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary’s campaign announcement that Lauda will override the AUA in five years, responded on Friday by AUA Chairman Andreas Otto: “We will remain the number one on site, in five, six or ten years.”

However, it is certain that the marriage of number nine to the British throne and the real estate estate estate will be a similar big party to the marriage of Eugenie to Jack Brooksbank on October 12, 2018.
Study on the Causes of Heart Disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the legacy of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the heritage of 9,000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to trace the causes of cardiovascular disease in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking area, the University Klinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne-Stiftung supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland are the Hochgebirgsklinik Davos, which belongs to the University, the Zürligt Foundation and the Zinterich Foundation.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diets are among the main risk factors that can be influenced by cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only known to be inadequate to the interrelation of genes and external influences.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known to cause possible disease-causing changes in DNA — so-called mutations — and about 200 are added each year.
According to the initiators, the five-year project is aimed at developing new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the investigation of kreuea and other people’s diseases, including neurological disorders and neurological disorders, according to Stefan Lelanken.
The chairman of the Kühne Stiftung, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), said that there is also a strong willingness to use the data for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the foundation in Davos has been treated in Hammer in particular allergies. He has been treated in Hammer and now will be able to biocircumcise for his biosurgery, and now will be off at the medical center of the Carcampus.
The biosamples of healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, according to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world.

Nigerian police release hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 boys tortured and abused from a Koran school. According to residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered that some of the victims were still underage," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo told him.
The boys were detained under the pretext of being taught in the Qur'an and being "improved"; in fact, the guardians were detained by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions," Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children under the age of nine, were detained by their teachers.
According to the Quran school existed for about ten years. Residents had been alerting the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents had been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Quran school. Sabo said that they had not seen. They had been stuck with the work of the children of the Poliah.
In predominantly Muslim northern Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often flawed state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee relief agency, more than 40,000 people have fled in the last ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police free 400 children from school
Police in a school in northern Nigeria have freed nearly 400 students from dreadful conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
The children were discovered there on Thursday following a statement in an Islamic-style school, where the conditions were "human degrading" and officials arrested the head of the school and six teachers after the liberation campaign.
The children, all boys, were held in their school like slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. TV images showed weakened and injured pupils in a noticeably poor health condition.
World Cup: More allegations after Messis and Klopps
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, FIFA World Football Association celebrates the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honour and thus a record.
After the captain of Nicaragua said he had never voted in the world football election, accusations come from other countries to the FIFA. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious justification.
In recent years, FIFA has shown itself to be a challenge: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of its president, Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, after the FIFA World Cup election, it was not until now that the suspected and the suspected nationality of the national was unresolved.
However, after Nicaragua’s captain has already complained that he has not voted at all, Egypt is complaining that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account.
FIFA apologises to the extent that "the signatures on the election forms were submitted in capital letters and therefore not valid" and has contacted the Egyptian association several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan's coach is also surprised.
While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association indicates that trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as much as it was ultimately assessed: with Lionel Messi in the first place, and with Madanese in the first place, Virgil van Dijk in the second place.
Nicaragua captain Juan Barrera had also raised allegations: "I did not vote for the <0x23>TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in his name.
The association's announcement came on Friday: true, but of course it was not intentional. The polling documents were "incorrectly" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the list of the Nicaraguan Selection". Hepitizi said in a statement that it was "offered" in the case of the association, but it was "offered".
The other cases are now being examined by FIFA in an investigation, but he stresses that the election process has been externally supervised by advisory firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers.As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp of the World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine-Affair: High-ranking Republicans Vote for Official Investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly pleaded for an official inquiry against U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the inquiry is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Wherever driving can be handled, it will be taken over from here, the wheres where, it will be determined, the best of the facts."
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former vice presidential candidate Joe Biden. "By the years in Ukraine, he asked for a "scooter" in Bizut.
The Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump for the Whistleblower affair, but few have noticed discomfort because of it. Scott’s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. The moderate governor of Virginia’s Loews had a statement against Loews and the politicking of Trump’s remarks several times.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, spoke out for the inquiry. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the ground."
As governor of the US states, Scott and Baker have formally failed to speak in the proceedings against Trump, which will be decided in Congress. Therefore, their statements are above all symbolic. However, the first senators of the Republicans have also been critically advised about the situation.
The case could be triggered in the opening of a lawsuit against Trump, which Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced to do so, and accused him of misuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the removal process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could endeavor a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on an actual removal of office falls through the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have a majority of experience.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete, 31, was arrested in June after her rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees were illegally boarding the port of Lampedusa. After few violent protests and international criticisms, her home was also re-invited by the Austrian Alexander van der Bundessprecher.
Now new heavy charges against rockets will be heard. Thus, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3" but the suspects have not been arrested in an admission camp in Messina, Sicily.The suspects could not have said that even "the Italians" could not have been arrested in the press.
The police reported in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped, tortured, and even murdered. These were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A. Hizwalige (26) and Mahmoud A. were systematically expelled from the country.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they can't know exactly who's coming on the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They're coming without passports," said new builder. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing from Libya. Therefore, it's very important that the "fishers are also going to be more likely to be there.
Italy’s former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini immediately apologized for the rocket, which is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk sets delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
“We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog “Electrek”.
The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk’s circulars said. The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customer. To do this, Tesla will have to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked it: Tesla’s shares went out of trading with a plus of over six percent. So strong the price hasn’t moved in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be produced in the current and coming quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom.
U.S. Budget Dispute: Only Bridge Financing Again
The new fiscal year will begin in the United States on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional funding until November 21.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump have agreed to raise Trump’s spending limits for the 2020 and 2021 budgets, the United States is still standing before the new fiscal year, which begins on October 1st. The United States will be closed on October 1st, and it will have to be closed on October 21 without spending plans, and the Senate will have to reopen on Thursday.
Shutdown Discarded
Preliminary funding is now available to the federal administration at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the spending plans for the fiscal year 2019 ending on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws in time, which can not be used to provide the resources of the various departments and authorities on bio.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate also has little ability, ten of the more than twelve spendings.
The ghosts are primarily prepared on the topic of resource allocation for the area of homeland security and border security. In the Senate, Republicans apparently try to force <0x24>12 billion for the wall building, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats have been distracted by the project over the Milli-Gegens and the other in the wall building plans.
At the wall building, the ghosts divorce
It is currently unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the coming seven weeks is an extension of transitional funding beyond November 21. Even a shutdown is not excluded.
In view of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the consequent danger of a shutdown, ideas to automate the process gain popularity. The proposal, p. 1877, to avoid shutdowns, would automatically reduce the funding of the federal government to the federal government.
France allows artificial fertilisation for lesbians and singles
In France, women and lesbians living alone are also expected to be exposed to artificial fertility in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted with a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to claim in vitro fertility.
The proposal still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. Also the French Bishops' Conference is against the renewal.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as a "chance" for society. It represents the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the cost of childbirth should be borne by all artificial fetuses.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband is further prohibited
The National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected an amendment to allow the widow to have access to the sperm of her dead husband. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artificial fertilization of a "post-mortem" was allowed. In Germany, in the course of the procedure, there was a "post-mortem" infestation of a skeleton.
On the other hand, many members of the La République en Marche (Republique en Marche) by President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had expressed their support for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They also stressed that if their husband died, she would be a widower to her children.
The initiators of the amendment, which has now failed, consider it unfair that a widow may in the future fertilize with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner.
Until now, artificial fertility in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They have to be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the maternity leave will continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertility is theoretically open to all women - it is still often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation payment: calls for air tax for Unis become louder
There is a lot of flying in colleges, which is why the country wants to make a climate tax in the future. The Rectors say they do not have money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The colleges should also be restricted when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratensschule
The discussion on climate change on flights from universities and colleges is still continuing to take place in the course of the summer break, and after the conference of the country's directors has been skeptical of the fact that it was not the first time that Kaursten had responded to a similar initiative from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans had now been given support from a July-Schoolen-Day.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB intelligence service, the detainees were reportedly fishing illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had already been arrested. But at that time there was an exchange of shots between the border guards and the boat crew. At that time, there were three Russians, there were shots, there were not shots, and one of the North Koreans.
The communist North Korea suffers from a chronic lack of food. The North Korean fishermen were thus travelling in Russian territorial waters, where the coast guards of Russia are conducting patrols according to their own data to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 ink fish confiscated
During the re-inspections, 30,000 ink fish were discovered and seized on the boats, as well as three fishing boats and two motor boats were seized and brought to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from domestic entrepreneurs, and thousands of North Korean fishermen have been temporarily detained there this year.
The head of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the far-eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with prohibited narrow-masked synthetic nets in Russia. These would be 200 simple nets, with these would be placed around the years, they would also be able to provide small living things from the sea.
Only 18,000 more in the future: U.S. lowers asylum threshold
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives at the White House.
The world’s richest country is shooting at asylum seekers: As the Foreign Ministry in Washington confirms, the threshold for the legal entry of refugees will continue to be lowered, especially in the future, for threatened believers and Iraqis to receive asylum.
The U.S. government wants to lower the historically low threshold for the admission of new refugees once again. In the 2020 business year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people will be left in the country.
The administration of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the readiness for asylum seekers from all over the world in recent years, with much higher admission limits under the predecessor of Barack Obama.
The summit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980. The U.S. Foreign Ministry still described the U.S. as "the most compassionate and generous nation in history", a wording that strongly appeals to the US president's use of the language.
A "responsible treatment" of refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their homelands to help rebuild there, Trump said. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of approval from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of dispute is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to shut down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency State. Whether there is a timely link between the current action and the current internal political developments in the US capital is unclear, under the possible threat of drohesentsen, and the current state of Amruensky is unclear.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees in the future, people who are persecuted because of their faith – and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and who have been at maximum risk, as stated in the statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States.
The U.S. wants people from this "northern triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries. In this context, the U.S. has first signed migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to enter the U.S.-South border.
Court orders release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
A female orangutans were transferred from the former Buenos Aires zoo to a human monkey capture station in the United States at the request of the Argentine judiciary. The "Sandra" born in 1986 in the Rostock Zoo were not directly granted the rights of a "non-human person" as a "person"; therefore, her release was not granted as a "non-human person" - only by means of Anmígender, and was forced in Doland.
The 53-kilogram-heavy human aphid is not able to adapt to life in the wild, so it is expected to live in the future in the open hedge of the Center for Great Apes in Florida, where 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees are already housed, including "Bubbles" of the U.S.A.S., 40 of them must be in the front of the "Bubbles" in the Florida.
"Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr zoo in Gelsenkirchen after her birth in Rostock, before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process of "Sandra's" fundamental rights has helped to transform the zoo from Buenos Aires into a forklift and transforms it into an eco-friendly park.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 metres in 46 minutes
The extreme mountain climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new husar race in the Italian Alps at the almost 3000 meters high Grand Zinne.
Without a grid, double floor or other aid, the Swiss forced the 550-metre-high north wall of the Great Zinne in a new record time.
Covered with jeans, T-shirt and supported only by absolute freedom of dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb, so he undermined the old top score by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important northern European walls.
Nike Benefits from New Online Marketing Strategy

Net profit rose to <0x24>1.4 billion in the past quarter (nearly <0x24>1.3 billion). That’s directly more than the customer’s base is 25 percent more online than in the previous year, with all the brand’s share of the new service being the same as in the strategy.

Lifelong stadium bans due to racism in Italy
Due to racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club has imposed a lifelong stadium ban against a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been slammed by the fan on Instagram. Jesus was then posted to a fan. he was. he was there. he was 28th with his private news, he was going to <0x23>roma, he was going to the club to take his magrecis.
The club responded late on Thursday. He reported the fan's account on Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma supporters will never be allowed to visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly, Italian fans chant racist accusations against black players of rival teams. "We can't have any racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation hasn't improved in rafting. In the case of Atafanto, the situation hasn't improved, and that's very serious between the bergachen and the statgachen, and one has to identify the responsibility.
But there were also recent discussions about the fans of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now confirmed 38 random fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are being charged with severe blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigations with an ad last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders were supposed to be behind the black trade with tickets. They had “militaryly controlled” the ticket trade for the fan basket and were supposed to have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole eras are thought of with clumsy designations. Take a closer look, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective feeling of life of young people?

Iran-US conflict: Rohani talks about ending sanctions - Trump opposes
Iran's President Hassan Ruhani spoke after his return from the UN General Assembly of an alleged U.S. offer to lift sanctions. The United States, in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, had put an end to all sanctions on the Internet, said Ruhani.
However, US President Donald Trump opposed his Iranian counterpart via Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed against him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had insisted that a meeting took place. "And America said, 'I should have lifted the sanctions on,'" he added.
However, no one can predict the outcome of the negotiations in the light of the current penalties and the "toxic atmosphere of maximum pressure" and the outcome of the negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is intended to deter the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. Donald Trump's US President-Emmanuel Macron was in a relationship with the UN President-Employed
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftermaths
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a short time, fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. The Turkish vice-president Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged accordingly. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake on Thursday shook the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and triggered panic in the million-dollar metropolis Ok. Now the government intends to deploy a commission to defend the country.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly constructed residential buildings collapse - among other things, dirt made by the many smaller earthquakes, which regulate Istanbul.
City planners such as the renowned architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas registered in the center as a place of refuge have been built for a long time. It was not until the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August that the Istanbul Building Engineer’s Chamber had warned that he did not estimate a Mill in Istanbul.
The epicenter of Thursday’s earthquake was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometers, as reported by the Afad Disaster Protection Authority. A smaller aftermath caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were brought to the district of Silivri for security reasons. Some students were crying at pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolitic Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth Plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest people. The earthquake in 1999 was more than 17,000 people. There were more of them near Istanbul.
Scientists fear an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. The earthquake on Thursday hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private individuals have so-called go-bags packed with all the necessities to stand next door, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wanes. When the next big earthquake is coming, it is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). Two of the scrimmage centers in Istanbul (Akom) and in the Mizinar district of Avbenga.
Warnings for aftermath in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users reported panic. Buildings were waking up. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Hemisphere. To be able to call on the people, to be alerted to the erbletten, Kerem Clinic, via Twitter warned.
According to official data, the time of the quake is 13.59 (local time), just minutes after the first quake, there was a quake, which was reported with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale, according to CNN Turkey.
It was only on Tuesday that an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 had shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Marmara Sea west of the million-dollar metropolis, the Afad Disaster Protection Authority announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that provided headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually release - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now, making it more likely, he told CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a bigger earthquake," Ersoy told the broadcaster. "Sooner or later the big earthquake will also come."
Already a few weeks ago there was an incident - the quake was also a source of great concern in Istanbul. Also, in Albania, there was a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 people injured. Also on the lake this year, the earth had been burning.
Parliament: New explosives in Ukraine affair
Two shattered documents provide new explosives in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible deposing process, the U.S. Democrats see themselves reinforced by two: the major complaints filed by an anonymous whistleblower about a phone call from Trump himself and his plight with the Plaw.
United States: United Airlines passenger detained in toilet - flyer redirected
A United Airlines flight was rerouted because a passenger was locked in the toilet, and the toilet door was blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline said.
During an unplanned interim landing on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour had been locked in it, US media wrote calling for other passengers. For the further flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to weigh the maschies.
In an online video, which is supposed to be from US media flight 1554, you can see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working to open the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?", says a man in the video, he's a man, he's been an off-duty. The airline has all the women at the airport.
The Kakerlake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes a Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous story “The Transformation”, British success author Ian McEwan, 71, wrote a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Cockroach" (Original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zürich) announced. This is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who in his earlier life was not ignoring or hated as a man's will.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once, if Brexiteers in high positions can only do the catastrophe of a no-deal."I can only call on him to do what: "I can borrow from a no-deal.
The story first published by Kafka in 1915 is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "turned into an immense mischief," gradually being excluded by family and society, and finally goes to the bottom. "Ian McEwan tends to stand in front of Kafka," to describe a world that is diop, the ko.
EU invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9.5 million in Austrian railway infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary will be provided with ventilation brakes to reduce the noise load caused by freight trains. In addition, sections of the rail connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna’s Neustadt and Sopron will be modernised and electrified.
This is intended to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, according to the EU Authority, which is funded by the EU’s “Connecting Europe Facility”.
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31
The German tour operator Thomas Cook canceled all trips until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travels could not be made "for insolvency-related reasons", the company said on Thursday evening.
These include bookings of the Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>GER TOURS, Booker Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. As it is said for travel starting from November 1, 2019, the company has left it open.
Thomas Cook in Germany had joined the board of the British parent company and had filed an insolvency application on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>ger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs around 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to send money back to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad that are still hosting Thomas Cook vacationers will receive money from Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer required to make extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without the presentation of separate invoices, hotels in the resorts are now expected to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman for the German press agency said. "This applies immediately and subject to the condition that individual travellers will be told by Thomas-Cook on request from these hotels or will be sent to Zahder immediately.
The insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who were forced to pay their accommodations on their own, some of whom had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The Deutsche Reiseverband (DRV) and the Bundesverband der Konsumentenzentralen (Bundesverband der Konsumentenzentralen) had sharply realized this.
How many hotels are affected will be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesman said. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschal-Lubber were still on the way from Germany. Zurich Germany has cancelled the holiday and return of the Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the payments now announced to hotels by Zurich Insurance will only help travelers who are still on the road. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly only on holiday, it looks bad. The company would also announce payment on Thursday night. the companies will also be canceling all the trips until 31 October, including the bus.
As far as travel starts from November 1, 2019, the company left open. In accordance with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said. In principle, Zurich insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel has been stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could be informed on the Kaera website about the possibility of reimbursement of the price of the trip and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosives in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued the engagement of Lady Diana. In Africa, he now walks directly in the footsteps of his mother.
With a blue splitter protective vest, British Prince Harry set fire to a mine in Angola and destroyed it.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the site of Dirico, he produced the ignition circle on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the Savannah landscape, without any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has more than 1000 oil feathered to the countenance, it has more than 100,000 min.
On the fifth day of his African trip, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same bomber, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to return the way she had gone at the time. The images were taken around the world by Princess Diana Min in 1997.
Harry, 35, and his wife Meghan, 38, have been on a ten-day African trip in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town since Monday.
Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In reality, however, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had always said that he would not have a third suspension of the Brexit negotiations until he was guaranteed to do so. But what statements have been made by the polarizing Britain has been heard from forever. The latest judgment of the Supreme Court in the UK can be passed by a judgement of the Supreme Court of the EU 31, which can be passed on to the court of the United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson considers deal to be possible
Meanwhile, while visiting a hospital, Johnson said that he would support an extension of the negotiations in the event of a non-cleaning by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna keep the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best of all, with a deal, I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And the time runs through the Brexit negotiators in Brussels could gradually run from it. John Primers and the British Negotiators still have about six weeks of time to prevent Britain's exit from the European Union without an agreement. However, even the recent talks did not come to an end.
U.S.: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States is still known to have risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this regard. The USA has already reported that, according to the U.S. Department of Health’s European Health Agency, LDC has reported.The study was published in the “New England Journal of Medicine.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
The video was shared millions of times by Mohammed Ali in online networks. The builder and actor living in Spain calls for a "people's revolution". For this Friday, he will have to protest against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian part of the economy in front of the military.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. There was already an increased police presence in the center of Cairo. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. Already in recent days, the police had been hanging out with the photojournalists and the police had been on the road checkpoints of their guards.
On September 20, the protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, protests were made with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted strongly to it. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW), they were arrested by the Human Rights Watch (HRW) in 2000.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to ban further protests against al-Sisi. The general has been governing the country since 2013, after he has rejected the democratically elected presidents.rejected the Islamist presidents, harassing activists and bloggers in Islam.
"Ocean Change": Herved Fuchs of Greenland Expedition Back
Polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. He was welcomed upon his arrival in the harbour of Hamburg by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg with the race night "Malizia" across the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had studied and documented the effects of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He has waited years for the young generation to sign up. It has been known for decades that the Earth is warming. Still, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often happens with the exception of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of global warming and the deterioration of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, it was measured with a drone of Greenland glacier, it was measured by measurable glaciers, and with nero.
For his "struggle for sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans", the Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the framework of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who are interested in the survival of the oceans, the Arved Fuchs is a great example of the year, says the Lord Skiris.
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>430 for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: This seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The invoice with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>80 drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases are detrimental to Rome's reputation, and we are urging the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the association of guides in Rome, told the Roman daily Il Messaggero.
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant quickly came. The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified. However, this is not to be taken from the invoice. Even a drink fee of up to 20 percent of the invoice is normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could actually face a resignation procedure after the turbulent revelations of the past days, the Democrats want to check this with their inquiry in the House of Representatives now as soon as possible - the case is a case of weeks.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj is allegedly counter-pressed. The indictment of the whistleblower, who has brought the conversation out of concern for national security and about the democracy of the United States with his complaint. Finally, in order to politicize one country and to use it for the other, he has acted against the Ukraine's use of the monsters.
The core of this project is also to be understood in the now published transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reproduce the full text. But the phone call of July 25th is only an episode of a much larger story, in the center of which, besides Trump, is mainly personal.
In fact, from the point of view of the public in May 2019, the story could very well take its beginning, when the New York Times reports of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He is going to meet me in Kiev with the right of the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer is not going to say to me - we know very well in Kaulinen, it is going to be for us, with the "We want to be a delicate" in time.
The lawyer and former New York mayor appears to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies attached to Trump’s counter-candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton has conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics at the time said he was never a cause for Russia’s prosecution in these US investigations.
This is about exactly the investigations of which Trump was going to be so prominent on the phone with Selenskyj in July.The version of the family of Giuliani and the president is: the former vice president and currently promising candidates for the presidential election.The presidential candidates of Obama, the presidential candidates, the presidential candidates, the presidential candidates, the presidential candidates, the presidential candidates, Joe Biden, the presidential candidates, and the presidential candidates of Ukraine.
In fact, the process was a bit different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian prosecutor general should go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. In addition, even under deep-corrupted gestures, Obama was accused of reprimanding.
Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp Disruptions: Social Media is Down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, Germany, the UK and Spain are mainly affected. On the website allesstörungen.de users report that Facebook has not loaded again since about 15.30 pm. Also Instagram does not send the error message untilher. Whatsapp was unable to load even if the content could not be retrieved from the skent. A

Polish Scientists Rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on their way by a hoseboat and several miles away from their base as their engine failed. They were fortunate in the accident - less than an hour took the Chilean rescue helicopter for the rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we received the message, at just ten o'clock we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the hoseboat."
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NEVER charge wirelessly
Practical, but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should still not be used.
Since recently several new smartphones have come to the market that support wireless charging and are selling very well - especially the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Although wireless charging of mobile devices is not extremely convenient, it is not very convenient.
Higher temperature adds to the battery
The researchers also warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. This is because of the significantly greater heat development. Lahetur is the lahetur. If you charge a cell phone perfectly by cable, it will have the 30th thing on the phone. The battery will heat itself up to 27 degrees within three hours.
Capacity and Lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature of the iPhone is still a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. That's why every single degree of battery plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery is not only limited to the capacity, but it also has a battery that is not too long to stand for the phone in general. It's not too long to stand on the phone, so that the battery life of the battery falls off.
Practical
The technique is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a suitable charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery should be charged without any annoying cable salad and hard-to-reach plug-in sockets from Apple. The technology can be used in case of Qi, because it is made of energy (is close to the standard inductive).
Everest Savings Photographer: 13 Eight Thousand in Six Months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the world’s 14 highest mountains in just six months, with Nirmal Purja, 36, reaching the tip of the Manaslu in Nepal, setting a record.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14,800 in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: from him a photo taken virally in the spring of mountain climbers standing on Mount Everest Serpent.
The image of the mass extinction triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8,848-meter-high mountain and the highest summit of the Earth. In May, 11 climbers had died in the conquest within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the siege of the 14th century: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking Mount Xixabangma in Tibet. The reason for this is called bad weather. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that the Nepalese government wanted to talk to China to raise him.
Four dead elephants found in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned".
The four bodies were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old, according to the police spokesman. An autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers, on whose land the animals had previously kept themselves harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed annually by elephants. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
In Sri Lanka, only some 7,000 elephants are estimated to have been killed, and the death penalty is theoretical.
British Oil Tanker Detained Leaving Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is leaving the port city of Bandar Abbas by Iran more than two months after its siege. This was announced by the naval service Bandar Abbas according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had the right of the sea tanker flying under the British flag on July 19th, firmly under the command of the Gulf
Management by Thomas Cook in Criticism
The Economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to investigate the plethora of the travel giant Thomas Cook comprehensively. It is intended to deal with the salary packages of the Board of Directors as well as the question of why the British government did not like to make a financial leap with the company that is struggling to survive.
Experts say genes are overestimated in the risk of bowel cancer
The role of genes in family increased risk of bowel cancer has been apparently overestimated so far. To this end, researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) in Heidelberg are coming to this conclusion in a current study. Other risk factors such as individual-risk factors have the habits of family-based nutrition, the habits of the patient.
Elon Musk to increase Tesla shares
This was written by Musk in an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday by the industry blog "Electrek", a strong demand that allowed Tesla to book 110,000 orders, Musk’s circulars said.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the public quickly, and Tesla will have to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went out of trading with a plus of over six percent. So strong the price has not moved in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95'000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be produced in the current and coming quarters. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit spans are low. Despite the boom.
Will the British government circumvent Brexit law? Johnson restraining
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson keeps a secret about whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the last law passed by Parliament against unregulated Brexit. On a similar question, he only said before journalists on Friday that his government will adhere to applicable law.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal deadline should no agreement with the EU be reached by mid-October, which Johnson criticizes as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU harder.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday expressed the suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political skeptics" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural sketch that postpones the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU's withdrawal.
Johnson said he aims for a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran apparently increases uranium enrichment
Iran’s President Hassan Rohani has raised pressure on European contractors in the fight to save the historic nuclear deal. “Unfortunately, European states show disability or lack of readiness when it comes to concrete actions,” Rohani told the New York Times on Thursday, in a press conference at the UN conference.
The conflict over the international agreement on the prevention of an Iranian nuclear bomb, which contained a counterpart of the promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations, has led the U.S. to withdraw from the agreement in 2018 alone, to react to Iran’s “maximum pressure” and to a new policy change in the course of the attack.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least preparing to use the centrifuges installed in early September, and Iran is preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges, according to the IAEA.
Perhaps the Europeans are not ready to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of US sanctions, Rouhani allegedly, but there will still be further talks that hopefully bring a solution.
Rohani continues to oppose Iran’s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on a major oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the municipality changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the U.S. assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Initially, the U.S.-backed Anwerts had not been known to have done what they had to do with the Huttirs.
"Those who raise such accusations must present evidence to Prime Minister John Rohani," said, but the European leaders did not know that during the UN General Debate. Instead, Mr. Merr could have called on Emman to say that the rebels in Yemen, like the rebels in Tayron, could not attack the Tayronists in Yemen.
Before possible talks with U.S. President Trump would first have to lift the U.S. administration’s far-reaching sanctions, Rohani demanded, calling on the Washington government to shift to a policy of “dialogue and reason”.
Comet from another star crosses the solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This has only been achieved before. The comet allows for conclusions on other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named after its discoverer at 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The most distant comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in the Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it was not a system of our unknown comets, but that it was also a comet.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object seen during a flight through our solar system after 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017.
2I/Borisov gives astronomers a rare chance to get insights into a foreign solar system from close proximity, before it disappears at no time. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to that of our own system, David, typometer, as the US astrophysical Institute of the Canaries reported, which is the equivalent of 15,000.
According to the analysis, the comet was on a so-called hypervelocity that took it out of our system, and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) said, and it was also responsible for the designation and categorization of our interstellar bodies, it was traded under the system of the interstellar C4, which was the number of its interstellar discovery of the catalog.
Astronomers are fortunate: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has been seen already in the air. Thus, the researchers remain many months for research. "The object will reach the highest professional brightness in mid-December and then only beowell until April 2020 will be seen with medium-sized telescopes".
Several observatories have already taken the visitor in sight. For example, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined in a first study the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Recordings of the Gemini-Kowai zeservum.
Researchers from the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar swing star, which provides a sort of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object could be similar to that of other objects, similar to that of comets of our solar system, and similar to that of which we are similar.
The discovery of two equal interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.How often, however, it would be difficult to estimate how many such spot visits are possible. It is still difficult to estimate one of the visitor’s missions.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part space probe Comet Interceptor (German: Comet Interceptor) on a standby position 1.5 million kilometres away from the Earth. According to Esa-Director of Science, Günther Hasinger, it is intended to either visit an intercontinental system such as one of our own, or one of our own, uncontacted, cos.
First landing at Beijing’s new mega airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the People’s Republic, the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital has landed the first passenger plane of China United Airlines, a special honour for the captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are expected to be completed annually at the new airport, and by 2025, there will be already 72 million. Chinese President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's most recent prestigious project will also be considered because of its six-story structure.
The complex has four starting and landing tracks to be expanded to seven later and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had said several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 - and considerably smaller - has been postponed ever since. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger plane landed after four years.
New Surfing Plane to Fly 2030: In Four and a Half Hours From London To Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours of operation definitely - of which the UK Space Agency dreams of UK Space Agency. To make this work possible, a special drive for the supersonic flight of the 2030s (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine could be the "Screaming" of the US-Breathing Engine, the 20th, the zifordstelten, Sabre), the company from Reaction Engine.
In order to advance the project, the British aerospace agency wanted to work closely together with the Australian Overarching Agency. A flight from the British capital of Virley to the Australian metropolis will take about 20 hours. At the time of the start of the program, Concord was the only aircraft to be used in the US for the transport of passengers. In 2000, the Concorde was used for the operation of the New York-America from 1976 to 2003.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport", writes Reaction Engines, among other things on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel with a speed of speed of Mach 5 - it can also be used with a speed of speed of up to a speed of up to five times as fast as the speed of the sun.
Revolt in Washington: Trump Wants to Track Anonymous Employers in Ukraine Affair
In the Ukraine affair about the US president’s potential abuse of power, Donald Trump wants to track down possible and undisclosed positions in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump told U.S. embassy staff in New York on Thursday, saying the person was almost "a spy" and had been treated "a bit differently" in the past than today.
This was assessed as an attempt to intimidate employers. The event was not actually public. However, several U.S. media circulated audio cuts from the speech on Friday. Democrats responded furiously to the president’s statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday announced preparations for a lawsuit against Trump, based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official, who had made serious allegations against Trump and the government’s central government.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants information from several government employees, according to the US president, “using the power of his office” to achieve that another country interferes in his favor in the 2020 US election.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyi at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is in front of the election for 2020.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of concealing in view of the Ukrainian phone call: the leading government staff had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. The system was removed. As usual, an electronic wording protocol was written out of the house and was written on the back of the phone.
The identity of the informant is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was supposed to be an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the topic, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called "whistleblower" has disseminated second-hand information that would have proved inappropriate. Therefore, there may be no spice or tips at all.
As Trump expressed in New York about those who were supposed to have provided information to the whistleblower, however, he provoked outrage. The president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, responded with concern and complained that Trump’s statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
The House of Representatives has been conducting several investigations in various committees against Trump and its surroundings for months, and in the face of the allegations of Ukraine, Democrats are now conducting investigations with a new impetus to launch a possible resignation process against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a schedule for our investigation," said the head of the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. Trump sharply attacked ship, threw him in a wrong picture of things, and once again demanded the resignation of the chairman of the committee.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy sector, who were mostly working under democratic but also under Republican presidents, said in a statement published on Friday that the investigation initiated by the Democrats was "unnecessarily used by Trump for a possible de-officialization process".
There is no precise timetable for the further proceedings. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could endeavor a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual resignation of office falls through the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans are still facing the majority of the U.S. Senate.
VW Operations Council: Jobs are being ‘scratched’
VW’s plans to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concerns the car manufacturer’s operating council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by 10 billion euros by 2023 by two billion euros. Of these, 500 million euros will be added in this year.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between companies and the Board of Directors in 2016 already provides for the removal of 14,000 jobs in Germany by 2020 alone. In principle, a job can only be dismantled at the automaker until it is proven that 20 jobs are required.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from the board of directors, jobs in production that are not actually available are being decommissioned by a different way - i.e. bypassing the official course, so that free-standing regular jobs would often not be reoccupied.
In these cases, the operating board has no way of forcing the relocation. In the meantime, many jobs are lacking in personnel, the work density is increasing, the concerns of a gradual extinction of the vehicle factories would be greater.In this way, it could only increase the concern of the world as well as the fear that the parts of the vehicle and the production of the other vehicle could be adapted to Europe.
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more globally and centrally control new projects. This also reduces costs and accelerates decisions - behind this is the goal of increasing productivity and therefore the competitiveness of China. From China to China, we are in the process of making good decisions. Production manager Andreas Tostmann said on a manager.
For example, for the first time since 2013, the cost of production per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told reporters that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be introduced in Wolfsburg on October 24, will not be reduced by 1.1 hours after our Wolfsburg event.
Twenty hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg plant is the only VW factory in which new vehicles are produced. The plants of Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture new componentsP. For Wolfsburg, however, VW-internally the Faust rule is that it is necessary to build only 700,000 cars per year in order to meet the requirements of this plant.
As production manager Tostmann announced last year, however, a million cars will roll out of the gang in Wolfsburg "perspectively". This is intended to enable the bundling of the golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is being reequipped to be the location for the e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan were last declining. Therefore, expectations are now resting on Golf 8. It is expected that despite all efforts to build the e-mobility of Wolf-Brussels, the first thing to do is to build the e-mobility of the city.
Voodoo forced into prostitution: human trafficker condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six suspected traffickers have to go to prison for this.
On Friday in Bochum, six alleged Nigerian traffickers were sentenced to imprisonment and imprisonment for up to eight years and three months. The defendants had thrown young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitute. In order to comply with their demands, they had to force them to commit adultery.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought with the help of Libyan smugglers in hose boats over the Mediterranean. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed to various brothels. The alleged smuggling costs of 25 000 euros were deducted from the average of the day.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the enclosure and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on Bordelle in the trial. "The work made it difficult for women to work physically and mentally," Judge Isabel Hoffmann said at the trial.
The verdicts are on the commercial and gang-wide inclusion of foreigners, human trafficking, supply and heavy forced prostitution.
UFO calls for talks with Lufthansa
FIm's ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa group has again threatened UFO with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "inform on October 14 on the labour struggle measures in the LH group", UFO Board of Directors Daniel Flohr said on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to discuss the negotiations with the UFO for months.
At this point, UFO now looks back on a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the requests. The company confirmed the decision and examines, on the other hand, Ufo's remedies, I say, and I think that a second court vs. the other court.
In August, Lufthansa had also filed an application with the Federal Labour Court in Frankfurt to have UFO’s status as a trade union reviewed by the court, arguing that the company had not employed a representative board for months and was thus unable to fulfill its role as a tariff partner.
There was a fierce leadership dispute in the Spartan trade union, during which numerous members of the board and the board of directors resigned, including Nicoley Baublies, the long-time trade union chief.The UFO had already started a strenuous stance on the question of the end of its leadership in the case of Kabin.
Easier Entry: Saudi Arabia Announces New Visa System
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but that is to change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract international tourists in the future. By 2030, it wants to increase payments to international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission said.
“The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,” said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is difficult to access for tourists so far. Visas are usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrims or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arzkonservative Kingdom expects more revenue from its own tourism business.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. In the aftermath, national oil production drastically broke down, the oil price drops to the height of its old production.

Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, extraterrestrial species, non-sustainable timber attacks and the growth of cities are the causes of the threat, the World Nature Conservation Union (UICN) reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 species known in Europe.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "potentially endangered", "strongly endangered", "extinct in nature" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct".
Eberian and Wild Rosskastanie Threatened
In Germany, Eberisch (Sorbus) is primarily threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway, or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild common Rosskastanies. They have been considered "dangerous" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the whole of the Balkans mining moth. They are not very much of a threat to the Europeans. They are naturally growing in the 1980s in Nippoa (Nizzault) and in the south-eastern Europe.
Strawberries and moose are also at risk
At the same time, IUCN scientists created new European red lists for molluscs, rodents and molluscs. More than one-fifth of the molluscs and molluscs and almost half of all mollusc species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly a matter of the destruction of the wild, and the velvety, in which is an important part of the velvenous and velvenous.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, director of the IUCN Office for Europe. "We need to address the impact of these people on our ecosystem and our ecosystem."
Earthquake in Istanbul: 34 injured reported
According to reports, 34 people were injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged, nearly 200 aftershocks since the earthquake the previous day. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake on Thursday shook the marble region in front of Istanbul and triggered panic in the million-dollar metropolis.
Now the government wants to use a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. Over the past 20 years Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disorder that marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian Earth Plate.
One of the worst earthquakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük, southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
As early as Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul, and the authorities called on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.

Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press release, some banks are expected to face the cost of travel provider Thomas Cook’s plethora of high depreciations on outstanding bonds and loans, including Credit Suisse, the Financial Times reported in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make a total of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.8 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion) depreciation on their books, according to the report.
Creditors of bonds would have to buy depreciations of <0xC2><0xA3>900 million to <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion and lenders between <0xC2><0xA3>550 million and <0xC2><0xA3>825 million. The amounts actually to be depreciated would probably be at the top of the bandwidth, an expert told the newspaper.
The losses of creditors at the end will be shown as a result of the insolvency procedure. A person close to this procedure did not shed too much hope. For example, the about 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook's Markauf in the United Kingdom, as well as Thomas Cook's hesshouf.
Rackete reportedly brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were supposed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't exclude this, but we don't even have secure information about it," said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea Watch, Ruben Neurichttur.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators have been arrested in the refugee camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the new builders said they could not come over and override their refugee organizations.
On June 29, Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa and a ship of the Italian financial police raided. The day the three suspects arrived there as well. The captains are being investigated for aiding illegal immigration.
U.S. warns federal government against Huawei
The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the federal government to trust Chinese network equipment company Huawei.
We believe the risks are too high," Pai told the "trade magazine" regarding the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national security law” that obliges any company “under Chinese law” to follow the instructions of the security authorities.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties of such requests," the FCC chief continues, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to require suppliers to make a "declaration of trust".
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, e.g. with technical solutions, reports the "trade paper", referring to its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology consists not only of hardware:
It is the software that is important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It is “very hard to imagine” that a government agency “no matter where it would be able to verify every single update in real time to detect security risks,” the FCC chief continued.
The Chinese company Huawei is making close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership relationship is opaque, and the employee company that is allegedly owned by the company is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the "Handelsblatt".
The U.S. is reporting findings that government employees have been placed within the company. Pai was recently in talks in Berlin to advertise for the position of the U.S.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A giant firewall illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire has been erased after hours - the cleaning could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and children’s cribs remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday, the competent prefecture said. The Interior Ministry had called on the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to the smoke. Injured there was no one. Farmers, farmers and breeders became uprooters of the three.
The fire could be completely eradicated on Thursday night, according to the prefecture. There is still a risk that odor will spread after the erasure, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters, as well as 90 police and gendarmes were deployed at the site.
A gigantic black column of smoke had previously emerged from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which manufactures additives for oil. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored, according to the authorities. In Seveso, near Milan, Italy, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the region of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told BFMTV that at first there was no "high toxicity" found in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river, dust dams were contaminated.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 2:40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause was initially unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called for greater investment in Germany to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany has to invest now, the earlier the better,” Le Maire said on Thursday evening, presenting the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weak, the minister warned.
We must not wait for the economic situation to get worse in order to make the necessary decisions.”
Those countries that have budgetary gaming spaces for more investment should act, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the minister added, referring to his country's high national debt, which accounts for more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. France's national debt must be "stabilized" and "reduced", Le Maire said.
France has repeatedly appealed to Germany in recent years to make more public investments to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to tackle its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax reliefs of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 billion for households.
As a result, the French government is responding to the protests of the Yellow Vest movement, which is expected to drop to 2.2 percent, as expected by 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson rejects question on Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticizes Parliament’s “capitulation law.”
Parliament is back, a law is urging the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit, but critics fear Boris Johnson could use another slippery hole.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson keeps a secret about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the last law passed by Parliament, which is supposed to prevent that. On a similar question, Johnson only told journalists that his government will adhere to the applicable law.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal deadline should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October, which Johnson criticizes as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU harder.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday had expressed the assumption that Johnson could try to use "political skeptics" to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural sketch that the entry into force of the law.strength of the EU's entry into force on October 31" is best with a statement after the EU's exit, and the European Union's move to the "Johnson.
Meanwhile, Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings said he saw the political debates about Brexit as a "walking in the park" and proved confident that the sought-after EU withdrawal would still take place: "We will enjoy what we are going to win" before "we won't say we won't fight at a time (Rem.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now acting as a chief strategist at British government headquarters Downing Street, behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister to a blatantly unprecedented situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very great rock photographers. But it does not always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (pockets) immerses deep into the whole private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was apparently proud and excited when he presented the image band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "<0x23>ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the immediate magic of Polaroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, some of which are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries" for the first time.
There are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course, you still see a lot of things in the middle: your man Paul.
There he always dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, phones in the bathrobe with a bag on the head or wears unshaped moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but not outside of the lighthouse. She told her at a farm in South England or in Scotland that she had been told by a latte on the BC, and in Scotland she was a normal BBBBB.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s footage is certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: You have to figure out if a great photo happens before you. And then you have to cut it at the right time," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it could just have been a bit of a photo, it would have been a whole different thing.
The light, the composition, the picture cut and the colors are true, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but in addition to all the anecdotals is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes can be perfected in the way of the 50-year-olds.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from neighbouring countries despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop imports of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there,” Erdogan said in New York, where he had attended the UN plenary.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems with imports of Iranian oil, as some companies had “returned due to US threats.”
Nevertheless, Turkey will “continue our relations with Iran, particularly on this and many other issues,” the Turkish president said, who has repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The U.S. has been pursuing a policy of “maximum pressure” towards the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. The U.S. says Iran is pursuing a secret nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the breakdown of Iranian oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran, and in recent months tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
U.S. Government to Restrict Admission of Refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the admission of refugees. The U.S. State Department on Thursday declared that the annual upper limit of a resettlement program should be reduced from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. This corresponds to a cut of 40 percent.
The U.S. State Department said the U.S. would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overloaded.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted because of their faith – and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs maximizes.
At the 1980 program, refugees from UN camps around the world are selected and relocated to the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the program. Already the current Trump upper limit of 30,000 was at, k is the lowest of the US.
"This is a very sad day for America," said David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee, which would further damage the U.S. leadership role in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to restrict immigration to the United States - both legal and illegal - strictly. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the upcoming fiscal year. These figures are separate from the relocation program.
Donald Trump: "Come close to a spike"
U.S. President Donald Trump has looked at whistleblowers in the spying affair, and whoever has accused the informant of abuse of power, "comes close to a spike," Trump told a U.S. news conference in New York on Thursday.
When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about the controversial events in the White House, he replied, "That's coming close to a spike." Then Trump added, "You know what we were doing as a spike, and we did it in the old days."
Observers appreciated the last remark on a possible allegation of the death penalty. The Democrats strongly criticized Trump’s statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. It was also an attempt to investigate a congressional investigation into a possible prosecution, prosecution and prosecution proceedings against him.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a complaint now published that he abused his office to request interference from another country in the 2020 U.S. election. In particular, it is best to talk about his possible disputed telephone conversation with his Ukrainian colleague, Mr. Trump, and Mr. Vladimir Selensky in his speech in the summer of Ukraine.
It is not yet clear who the whistleblower is himself and his informants, but according to the New York Times, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst for the CIA’s foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat: Baby and small children drown in Aegean
People try to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece again and again. The boats are often too small. Seven migrants have been killed in the fall of a hoseboat, including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the fall of a hollow boat. Among the deaths were also a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were subsequently rescued from the fleet by the crew of a passerby.
Among the victims is said to be a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Assistance Unit (UNHCR) 17, they arrived on this route.
The Who Breaking Concert
A U.S. rock band's The Who concert ended in the middle of a performance in Houston on Wednesday evening (local time), and on the eighth song, Daltrey said to the audience, "I think I should leave it alone, I should leave it alone."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey could "not really talk now". Townsend promised the audience to come at his expense at a compensation concert, but an appointment is not yet fixed.
The Who cancelled the performances scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, which are due to be retrieved at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
All of a sudden cancellation: WeWork shakes real estate markets
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office renter.
Within a few years, WeWork will grow from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Tenants need to fear billions of revenue.
The crisis of office renter WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance of the market in the world’s newest real estate markets. The company had just a few days ago suspended founder Adam Neumann as its boss, shifted the planned stock market trend, and with the sale of subsidiaries and values from New York, the company has joined the company’s "private jet for the finances" and the management of the company.
WeWork is now planning to lease large office spaces to new companies in the long term and rent them in part small units to members in the short term. This can be done by single freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has always been one of the Millennials with this business, the Millennials, the Millennials, and the Millennials.
According to the "Financial Times", WeWork has now concluded lease agreements with durations of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than <0x24>40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate brand.
Calculations by economist Dan Alpert Büyder from Cornell Law School in New York According to Büyard, where WeWork rented out of Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the last 24 months, weighed up almost 300,000 square meters of office space. In the last 24 months, weighing up in the US, in the same way that in New York, the new contracts of WeWorks were in this time.
Even in the UK capital, the balance in the real estate market could shift noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the principal tenant, in a deka for nearly 100 million euros purchased last year by the savings fund provider in the central office.
Many landlords have rebuilt their properties for the requirements of WeWork only with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model more profitable soon, the owners of the property would not have to write down a part of the expected billion-dollar income.The long-term income of the owners of the property would probably have been the special income of the reserve.
Russia arrests many North Korean fishermen again
In recent days, a total of 262 other fishermen who had been caught illegally fishing in the waters have been arrested, according to the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB, Interfax, according to the Interfax news agency.
Only ten days ago, 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested. Previously, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it said. The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
Accordingly, the North Korean fishermen were travelling in Russian territorial waters, where the coast guards of Russia are conducting patrols according to their own data to protect their marine biological resources. During the renewed controls, more than 30,000 ink-fish were detected in the engines of Begetok in 2018. In addition, two ink-fishes were detected at Begetokboo and in Nakods, and after the data of Dersch.
The Russian Fisheries Authority has also complained that it did not issue fishing licences to the North Koreans. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been temporarily detained there in 2019, according to media reports.
The head of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the far-eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with the banned in Russia. they would not be 200 masked synthetic nets. they would be put around, with these would also be the small living beings themselves, and they would be engulfed from the meholer.
Three members of the Russian Coast Guard were reportedly injured during the arrests last week in Moscow. According to the FSB, a North Korean who was also injured died later in his injuries. On that September 17th, the Russian border guard set up the second one, and the first one was a North Korean.
U.S. Bans Ex-President Castro
The U.S. would have imposed a ban on the entry of former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. State Department justified this in a statement on Thursday with Castro's involvement in "grave human rights violations". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean's 100-year-old party, it is more politically imprisoned, and wants to be in the system of the Cuban state.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also blamed for human rights violations there by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The violations of human rights and the use of violence in Venezuela" are the responses of the Cuban regime to the earlier Kubadu.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had issued a ban on entry, among others, against Venezuelan government and the military. For months in Venezuela there has been a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition. The United States has imposed a series of sanctions against Maduro's government and the government itself to impose a series of sanctions against him and his colleagues against him.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro’s closest allies. The socialist Caribbean Island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of doctors sent. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence officers to Venezuela to help the government in order to repress helpers.
New Climate Protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement plans to reopen actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world. The start is due to the time shifts in New Zealand and Australia, before the protests move across Europe to North America.
How big the worldwide claim on this Friday will be after the record-breaking participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday over four million people have been on strike for the climate. This Friday we do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. A tweeted in her 70th birthday, so far it has been in the framework of the 38th.
In particular in Germany last Friday, the rally was very large. A good third of all the protesters around the world - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates from Fridays for Future. This time they were also on a small list of people in Berlin, in Klitenburg, and in the Netherlands.
At the age of 15 at the time, Thunberg had stood before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of their country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. But in a short time, the Fridays-for-future movement has emerged.
Together, they call for greater ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threatening climate disaster, and in particular, according to the Paris Agreement, global warming must be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived in New York just a month ago after a two-week transatlantic meeting with a high-sea racing yacht, where she had last participated in climate protests and UN summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the United Nations with her Stotehooters. She gave an emotional speech in which she expressed her support for her enthusiasm for her live chatting at the State and the Heid.
Russia bans smoking on balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the Emergency Ministry said on Thursday in Moscow, according to the agency Tass. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who still smokes has to face a fine of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette is to spark a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, similarly burning candles fall under the ban. It is no longer enough to grill meat spices on the balcony.
Attack against cybercriminals - Investigators lift servers
In the fight against cybercrime, German investigators have for the first time picked up a large server provider for illegal stores on the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach, on the Moselle, through which international criminals operated their operations.
This was reported by the Attorney General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night in a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects were said to have been the operators of the world’s second largest darknet drug market, “Wall Street Market”, which the investigators had smashed in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016, a cyber prosecutor-general was arrested.
This was the first time such a host has been developed in Germany, it said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
During the access campaign with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and in the neighbouring country. They have been the result of almost five years of investigations. In the afternoon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New World Climate Protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go to the streets again today for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world.
Protests are planned in at least 65 cities in Germany, including in metropolitan areas such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Yüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protesters <0xC7><0x80> Who are Thunberg's backyard men?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoking factories that warm the climate. More surprisingly, a 16-year-old girl calculates the power manipulating the manipulating men of this time Meipulates the mirror around the nose. But what is the point of her own storytelling?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg has put the masses in motion and brings young people to raise themselves for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young man has created a collection of children and young people to win it for himself. It is possible to learn about this world, and in 1212, this young man has created a nickname for himself.
But there's a very good side of this? Why is it also necessary to share a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has a wealthy PR manager at her side. At the same time, she has published a little of her mother's book, which has been sold to her, and she has sold it to her far from the point of view.
This is where the ghosts differ: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially in saving the world? Is it still authentic that certain circles of people work together with world-saving brokers during the world-saving action? Any position that can be taken in the end can be taken from a critical point of view, from a different point of view, from a different point of view, which is always reflective and reflective.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crosses Our Solar System
A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system.
Astronomers’ assumptions have been confirmed: a strange comet is currently crossing our solar system – it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington – Researchers have long only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. It was named after its discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently employing astronomers around the world.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in the Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It was in fact an unknown comet, which is not derived from our solar system.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain close insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin, which moves it out of such a way.
Comet has been seen before arrival - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in depth. Unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his orbit, which means that he can only be explored from the Earth for many months."The object will be explored from the US until October 2020.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León put it, the spectrum of the swing star is similar to our probe, it is similar to the probe in our probe, it is located in the other cog.
The observation, however, goes beyond solitary knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
It was only recently that a giant asteroid passed through the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely Rejectable": Rachel Johnson Dismayed About Brother
Boris Johnson's youngest brother leaves the cabinet, and now his sister speaks the Prime Minister's war-language with clear words as "flavorless," not the brother she knows.
"Capitalization", "fraud", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to equip himself - at least verbally. During the questioning hour in the lower house on Wednesday, this was met with mass outrage from the opposition, and now more critics have reported: dozens of his own bishops and Rason.
The well-known journalist and author told the broadcaster Sky News, her brother uses words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU austritt should be "hanged, long-drawn, divided, fed and fed up". She considers this to be overly reluctant to "Wattreet" to the EU. She does not recognize the version of her brother-in-law to the judiciary.
In particular, she pointed out that her brother Jo Cox, an EU-friendly member of the House who was murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 exit referendum, said that her best way to honor her was to "understand" her "by passing the Brexit" and that Boris Johnson had "overlooked" her.
The widower of Cox also sharply criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to be passionate and determined about what you believe to be - no matter what kind of attitude you are. But you should never be in any other position.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson’s younger brother Jo had laid down his post as Secretary of State and his term as Tory MP. “I’ve been torn between loyalty to family and national interest in the past months – it’s an indissoluble tension,” Jo Johnson said.
Johnson's language also fell into sharp criticism in the church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language, which "is not worthy of this country". In a joint statement, we should not say, "In the past, too, with the speeches of the Parliament, too, so is the speeches in the akhalba,
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL sets a strong mark: in the upcoming Super Bowl half-time show, two women with Latino roots perform. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming NFL Football League final, announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. In the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On Floorcher") is puerker ("On Floor).
"I love that this time the Super Bowl puts two women on the stage - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as the actress in November dema and is an actress.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer, her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first two-language album and single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the U.S. every time. This year many value the choice as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by President Donald Trump’s immigration policy, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sporting event and at the same time a giant advertising show. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones provided furor there. Usually, at the NFL finals, it's a lot more than 100 million fans looking at it.
Last year there was premature political controversy. The reason for the dispute was the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up for police violence against blacks. In the course of the national anthem, a supergroup had been criticized by President Donald Trump, among other things, and was hard-heartedly treated by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and for that reason - a super-much of a trinity was acted on by a super-and-they-they-they-they was-they-a-theyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
An actor and YouTuber joins Egypt’s ruler: First, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who had no influence on the grounds of saying that they had taken blood on the streets of Egypt, and they had not spent the last week on a Trump spree, and they had not spent the last week on a pilgrimage.The one of the two sneaked back into the airport on Friday.The one of the Stahams had swam back to the airport.The man in front of the state, the US President Abdelfatah al-Sisi, returned from the UN General Assembly.
In the view of the president of the other man, who is currently deciding what is happening on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained with him abroad, where he deprived himself of access to the security forces, who would immediately arrest him, if he was known to the police, against the stiffness of the land, and was attempting to enter the front of the grave.
He goes directly to the head of state in a very russian language. As the people are hungry, the president swoops in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, he says. The army leadership, on which Sisi relies his rule, he's exploding the corruption and enrichment of the country, he's exploding it for a long time.
For the first time ever since Sisis had been attacked by Kinamoengen, Kinamoengen had protested against his rule, and almost 2,000 citizens, including prominent figures of civil society, had been arrested at the police, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where the protesters were supposed to smash banners with the President's portrait in pieces until last week, a mass police presence was reported on Friday. The security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the roads of the mounds. In Cairo, several police stations were stopped at the station of the city.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be the Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not collide with police officers." But as a retreat, that is not to be understood: "Egypt is the Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much power
If the internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different testing options.
If you sign an Internet contract, you don’t need to blindly trust the provider’s speed data. Customers can even check how much of it is actually achieved in the event of incidents.
Finally, the pre-promised transfer rates are part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the consumer centre of Bavaria.
If the connection seems to be always much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different testing options. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the testing of the suppliers is carried out according to specific specifications of the supplier and is therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," the Bavaria Consumer Centre points out.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days to the provider to produce the promised service. It is best for the affected person to do so in writing.
If this does not work even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and, in some cases, also claim damages. However, in the absence of success, only the appeal will help.
First rank Republican to be investigated
As the first high-ranking Republican, the Governor of Vermont voted for an impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump. "I think the inquiry is important, yes, and where this comes from, will be determined by the facts of the case - which can be determined.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate the interventions of Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump for the Whistleblower affair; few have noticed discomfort because of it. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly turned against a foreword of Trump's foreplay, the foreword of politics, and the foreword of Trump's foreclosure.
Spider-Man to Remain in MCU: Further Marvel Film Planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel would go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how to proceed with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man is getting another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), according to "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home", according to several U.S. media reports. According to this, it is expected that the 21st of July will be filmed in the U.S.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel-Boost Kevin Feige quotes: "I am delighted that Spidey's path will continue in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can continue working on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to work on what in different universes to play with Sony.
But what about the sudden good news? Sony Marvel is said to have submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney Group, which also includes Marvel, would share 30% of the revenue of coming Spider-Man movies, but the news is not confirmed.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the US has now reached the big finale. In the final, there were many Happy Ends and so many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who had been involved in the series for many years.
One foreword: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some feedback showed again the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of her failed and happy marriage or her happy marriage.
But even her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned accidentally in the "Suits" finale then, of course, in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is just walking towards the altar to get married to his fiancé Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51).
Aegean: Baby and four more children drowned in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned in a refugee boat in the Aegean. In total, seven people died in the accident, according to the Greek Coast Guard on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland, and four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Assistance Agency (UNHCR). Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that both countries will be joining this route.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner in charge, he wanted to "inform himself in Turkey about the refugee situation," Seehofer said on Friday. Then he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission confirmed on Friday the planned trip of Seehofer with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusual number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive, with 654 people relocating to the Greek islands alone on Tuesday, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increase in the figures last raised doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement. This provides for the EU to be able to send back all refugees and migrants who illegally come through Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to take one out of the syringe for each Turkish citizen.
However, due to the lack of personnel, the process of processing of asylum applications is only tedious on the Greek side. In Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, there are almost 29,400 people. The worst is the situation in Lesbos: In a camp with capacity for 650 Migra are currently 5,200 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 have there been so many, the state broadcaster reported.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change will be one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Dr. Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology, and Dr. Allen-Herdiologie.
Green politician must be held accountable for embarrassing photo pane
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was manipulated for this reason the cups?
The Canadian Greens chef holds a multi-way cup in her hand in a photo, but now it turns out that the cup has been manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It's been quite a long time unnoticed - and in the end it was still noticeable. The reusable coffee cup with metal stool has never been held in hand by Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens. She was on the party's website, she was on a photo, and she was also on the front page of the photo, and she was looking at the National with this cup.
Green boss has to take responsibility for photo pan
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party produces Fake News to appear more credible on the topic of "environmental protection", and this amid a campaign for the lower house election, in which Trudeau is also increasingly struggling because of a blackmail scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and started the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their disposable book".
May showed herself shocked and insisted on her blog that she still didn't know anything about this action. To underline this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, only had a cup in her hand. However, the one who did not put her right, she put it on bamboo, it's there, and she always said it was in the parlogue.
"I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," May says to the Guardian, and at the same time asked herself something from her over-involved team: "If you'd like to edit a picture like this again, I wouldn't be able to do anything with it, then you can't do anything with it."
The German Greens were also advised because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel in Shitstorms - but their pictures were not photographed. So the Bavarian Greens boss, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as reported by mekur.de*.
Influencer wants free upgrade: lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng allegedly secured an upgrade by Cathay Pacific by mail, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board – and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
This case, however, shows how not to do it: An self-declared influencer has actively asked for a free upgrade by Airline Cathay Pacific. On Instagram, more than 65,000 users follow Jaqueline Ng. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the flight, Jaqueline’s employees refused an upgrade, although she presented an email in which Cathay Pacific allegedly posted an upgrade. The letter wants the influencer to have received from an airline’s marketing staff. The airline, on the other hand, accused Jaqueline of mailing the email.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The staff at the JFK airport were not skeptical: they were skeptical. They were also following the Maestrien system. And in fact, the Maebtenden, the Jaetakmm, was supposed to be the same.
Airline employees at the airport canceled Jaquelines’ ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For <0x24>1,400 (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had refunded her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed the cost for the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains locked for future flights. The terms of the airline also state that she does not have to pay the new flight now.
Oil prices report on ceasefire in Yemen according to
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Last year, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost <0x24>61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate fell to <0x24>55 per barrel (WTI) per cent to <0x24>1.
A report by the Wall Street Journal about a ceasefire in Yemen was triggered by the rally, and Saudi Arabia said it had agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought to an end in mid-September five percent of global oil production. The Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the country of civil war Yemen had claimed the attacks for themselves.Saudi Arabian region is making a political stand in the Iranian response.
If an agreement really comes to fruition, one can focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the Commodity Strategy department at Bloomberg’s Saxo Bank.
Oil prices continue to move downwards over the past few days, with a barrel of WTI oil costing up to <0x24>59 a week, Brent costing up to <0x24>65.
Lastly, Bloomberg had reported on Insider that repairs to oil plants in Saudi Arabia were progressing faster than expected after the attack in mid-September, according to which the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moves back towards the source direction.
Recently, there have been several press releases calling for insiders reporting on the rapid progress of the state oil group Saudi Aramco in the repair work, but raw materials experts have pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning to avoid a stock exchange and negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the fortification by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port E<0xC3><0xA5>funita. The crew is now preparing the departure in advance of Anwed, while the shipyard continues.
However, the U.S. has announced that it will transfer missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia as Iran’s enemy, and the fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and the United Kingdom has increased significantly over the past few weeks.
Accusations against Trump escalate
In the case of possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, the Trump White House has been accused of concealing accusations. Several senior government officials had intensely tried to talk, after a controversial phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president.The speech of the President of Ukraine, the speech of the President of the Republic of Moldova, was "the end of July, the attack of the President of Moldova".
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that there will soon be a third summit of powerful Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump in the nuclear dispute. The sense and the prospects for success of such a meeting are due to lack of progress in the implementation of the agreements of the first summit in Kaipur.
The U.S. had so far done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit last year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry adviser said, criticizing the tightening of U.S. sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the U.S. and South Korea. But he hopes to come back to a "return" with Trump's "wise and
Trump said on Monday he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he prepares himself for it. Negotiations on a disarmament of North Korea's nuclear and missile program have been going on since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim's re-entered in February, when they arrived at the Stoken in Hanoi.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers to help clear mines
With a blue splitter protective vest, Prince Harry in Angola symbolically fired and destroyed a mine. But near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the site of Dirico, he built the ignition circle. At a safe distance, the bomber did not explode. In order to explode, all of the bombers had to look at the target, to see the 20th anniversary of the ignition.
Pound under Pressure - Interest Rate Expected
British Pound under Pressure
In the face of a sudden interest rate cut, the pound loses value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on the Bank of England (BoE)’s soon-to-be interest rate cut add to the pound sterling, with the British currency up to 0.4 percent on Friday at <0x24>1.2269.
The triggers of the sales were the statements of notary banker Michael Saunders. This brought interest cuts to the talks, even if a chaotic Brexit could be avoided, as the uncertainty will affect the British economy at the foreseeable moment. This statement from Broussett was said to be a politically surprisingly restrictive, since Saunders' listing is not surprising.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed to the burdens on the economy due to the Brexit hack, without signaling a direct interest cut, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to take his country out of the EU on October 31 without a divorce agreement.
More: With his provocations, the British prime minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says trade paper editor Kerstin Leidel.
Doping: Further Russian Manipulations Proven
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today head of integrity of the World Athletics Federation.
New details of the doping scandal in Russia emerge to the forefront of the start of the World Athletics Championships - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and also only gradually. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping World Championships were launched.In January 2019, they finally supplied the Doping Laboratory until 2012.
In December 2014, systematic fraud was revealed in Russian sport. After that, the Wada had closed the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. At the World stage, they were banned from the country, and at the World stage, at the 2016 International Olympic Committee, they were banned from the sport, at the 16th of February, at the individual sportstest.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban again, but called for access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should be disclosed about the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in the state doping. They should help to punish athletes and athletes subsequently.
The chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the data were manipulated from the Viblon analysis laboratory in Moscow. "Yes. We received the data from the How-man," we said, "We should have checked the data from the How-man, "they should have kept the data from the inter-review, the inter-force, which were the Wrs of the Wrs.
The World Cup was not affected
This confirms the position of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organization to be held on Russia's ban. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes are starting under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put in place manipulations and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the re-blocking of Rusada and, at worst, the exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
