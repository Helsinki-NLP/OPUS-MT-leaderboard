Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried that they will “look like Mupeti”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are shocked at the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for the proposal is plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the title could spark ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party said that his group fears that “it is rimming with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means stupid.
A member of Plaid said the group as a whole was “unhappy” and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was approaching the name change "with an open mind", but noted that the MWP was close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The assembly, which is now preparing legislation to introduce the name change, said: “The final decision on how the members of the Welsh Assembly will be named will of course be on the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals, where broadly supported the variant called the Welsh Parliament Assembly.
As for the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the name of the Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the most support in public discussion.
Members of the Assembly apparently propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus can be a source of concern for President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
The Reform Laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on disqualification of members and a proposal for a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the issue of their title as part of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
A multi-party vote should resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athenians have long insisted that the name of a northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek territory, and have repeatedly protested against the country’s requests for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the name-change plebiscite, said he would not run the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that the name change is simply the price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's are quiet because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
“The old people I’ve been talking to say there used to be a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams says.
“There’s not one here today.”
The disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are dealing in a different way today,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly go.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of the property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started.”
As he adds, the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of these types of people, who will not help the remaining saints in the neighborhood much.
“Absolutely most people who buy apartments in these houses will be white,” he says, “and therefore soon the day will come when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into apartments will become members.”
Both churches built a white congregation even before Harlem became the black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original Belarusian Methodist Congregation moved in the 30s of the 20th century.
The building was taken over by the Black Congregation, whose devotions took place not far away.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping mall, who refused to hire or raise blacks.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they also ordered an outdoor pool.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert, who played the game in July, called it a differently: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first show in the world played by Black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger show at a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, St. Martin’s was a complicated story of architects and builders, some of whom were appointed by the lay representatives of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The Council of Elders – the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay representatives – sent a letter to the diocese in July in which he expressed concern that the diocese would “try to pass the costs” on the council of the elders, although the hiring of architects and builders, which the diocese did not.
Some parishioners complained of insufficient transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old boy in California who dives for hummingbirds
According to official reports, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who plunged into California for hums on the day of the start of the humming season.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help, and then he and the whole group came down to him to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that the call was first considered to be the joy of catching the hump, but then “he realized he was screaming, ‘He kissed me!
He kissed me!”
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that "he had the whole area of the key bone scattered."
“I cried out to everyone out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water!’,” Hammel adds.
The boy was transported in critical condition by helicopter to the Children's Hospital in San Diego.
It is not known what type of shark is behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles said at a news conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Authorities have closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's wants to build chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams cosmetic streets in the style of a storehouse, where specialized retailers will be available.
As part of the strong rise in the UK cosmetics market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household goods are declining, streets with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country.
Investment in cosmetics is linked to the attempt of supermarkets to find use for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double its cosmetic range to 3,000 products and will also introduce brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range from L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space thanks to brand locations similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also re-releases its boutique make-up range, so most of the products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test the concession at two Saintsbury’s stores. The first such store was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and next year will be in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping on the internet and moving towards the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local stores means that supermarkets have to work harder to attract people.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe says stores will look more and more like stores as a chain of supermarkets seeks to better offer services and non-food products to fight discounted retailers such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of stores in Argos and has also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are the chains it bought two years ago. This has increased food sales and acquisitions are even more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to transform the department with a cosmetic and pharmaceutical assortment ended infamously.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from drug sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold its 281 pharmacy for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds pharmacy chain.
Lloyds is set to play its role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands to four stores including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Said Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s business director, “We’ve changed the look and style of street cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues, with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should meet all the needs and attractive environment and the convenient location means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is 'disgusted' after Holly Willoughby resigned from contract for <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
Dragons star Den Peter Jones "shoots" after TV moderator Holly Willoughby resigned from a <0x24>11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their brand of homewear and accessories True.
The couple's business was compared to the Goop brand by actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 70-year-old moderator announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to informed sources, Jones was "smiling" when the television star at a tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to the new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – he would no longer be able to devote enough time to their knowledge.
The company was compared to the Goop brand by actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of the moderator Willoughby by an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 70-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the True brand, Jones left Britain for one of her summer residences.
An unnamed source says: “Truly was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which will secure her for several decades ahead.
Her decision to leave all of the participants was shocking.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
At the Marlow headquarters there is a full warehouse of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning moderator, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the greasy investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother of three and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Cappo, for ten years.
Willoughby founded the True brand with Tara Cappo in 2016 and 20-year-old Jones joined the board in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is set to become M&S ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin in moderation for I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult negotiations “and then we fell in love”
He was joking about the criticism he received from journalists for a remark that some consider to be “unworthy president” and for how he spoke positively about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his ridiculous “vote” voice.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that after their first June meeting in Singapore, Trump assessed it as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But the talks about the elimination of nuclear weapons were trapped at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, prominent North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho said on Saturday to world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "responsive response" from the United States to its first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were on the verge of a war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.”
His effort to improve relations with Kim, he said, has brought positive results – the end of missile tests, help to liberate hostages, and the return of the remaining U.S. troops to their homeland.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people out of this crowded arena, we should have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok have been expelled from their homes, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a necessary prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is bringing together a team that travels to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign staff can work there.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr. Sutupo, said Indonesian activists are evaluating the situation in Paul to find out whether international organizations will be allowed to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for the rage of Mother Nature.
Although Tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not common at all in other parts of the coast.
The apparent shortage of sirens warning Paul of a tsunami has probably contributed to the loss of human lives, even though a warning was issued.
Even at the best time, travelling between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
In the event of natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship that landed in Lombok and helped the victims of the earthquake is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days to get to the place of the new calamity.
Improving Indonesia’s poor infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Widodo’s campaign and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
Next year, he will try to run for election again, but his government is undermining funding shortages.
President Joko also faces pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, when members of the Muslim majority take a more conservative form of faith.
Street fighting between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of more than thousands of people and tens of thousands have been expelled from their homes.

Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at London's Stamford Bridge on Saturday, saving Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 yards ahead of Chelsea when his team lost 1-0.
He turned the ball over to the left and shot at a distant stick.
The bullet flew high and headed to the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually skipped the jumping Kep Arrizabalagu and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as much forward as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching me, so I didn’t think much about it, and I shot him at one touch.”
Chelsea scored 1-0 in the semi-finals after Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
Attacker Blues sent his passport back to Mateo Kovacic, then turned in the middle of the pitch and sprinted to half of Liverpool.
The scooter hit the ball quickly.
Then he sent the ball through the beautiful Hazard street to the limestone.
He ran away to the defense and left to the remote bar next to Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
On Wednesday at 5 p.m., Liverpool in the Champions League group at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, will face a local team.
Chelsea will play at 15:00 on Thursday in London with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
As the Indonesian Disaster Authority said on Sunday morning, the number of earthquake and tsunami casualties rose to 832.
The 7.5-degree quake struck on Friday, sparking waves up to 6 meters high and trapped many people in ruined buildings, Sutopo Purwo Nugroh said at a press conference.
The city of Paula, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was visited by ruined buildings.
Police Arrest Twenty-Year-Old Man Suspected of Abducting Woman
A woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning, and the police immediately opened a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman with point injuries was found at 7.55 p.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard something to sign up.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is just the beginning, but I would like to appeal to anyone who was moving near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose onboard cameras could record something, to contact us, because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask where she was found this morning.
Police said an investigation was underway and are now informing relatives of the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to speak.
The residents have now learned that it will take a few hours before they can return home.
A policeman told one man that the entire area is now considered the scene of the crime.
There was a crying woman on the spot.
He repeats, “That’s terrible.”
At 14:00 there were two police vans behind the scenes and another was waiting outside.
In the closed area, there are a number of police officers who monitor the house.

Cromwell's statue in parliament has recently become a hit because of the debate over "rewriting history"
His expulsion would be a deserved punishment for his fanatical Puritan followers, in the style of the Taliban, destroying many English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of sculptures, it was essential that the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace would become one of the targets.
Cromwell did not command or practice iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The characteristic depiction of Cromwell, authored by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the character’s historiography, which many believe still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although today somewhat less than at the end of the 19th century, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of unwavering historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure that represents one side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and reminding."
A killer pig shattered by a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig farmer was attacked and killed on the market in southeast China.
According to the South China Morning Post on Sunday, a man, who is only given the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a lump of artery in a blood clot near a grove in the market in Liou-pchan-shue in the province of Kuei-cho.
The pig breeder is preparing to apply the vaccine to pigs in the pond on May 30, 2005, in Si-ning, China.
On Wednesday, he reportedly came with a cousin from the adjacent province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door to the side dungeon was open.
He said there was a large pig in the pot with a blood clot.
According to the information, the forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig of the farmer broke.
"The brother had his legs full of blood and scratches," the Guiyang Evening News newspaper quoted him as "Wu."
A security camera footage shows Yuan arriving on Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News newspaper that the pig was closed so that no one else could think about it when the police collected evidence at the scene.
Market officials are allegedly negotiating with Yuan’s family for compensation for his death.
Attacks of pigs on humans are rare, but they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and the man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, 300kg of pig was pulled by a Welsh farmer to the tractor and taken away by the farmer’s wife.
After an Oregon farmer ate his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that piglets are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “release.”
“They’re just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa’s remains will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken and move over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, flooding will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At 5 a.m. Eastern time, Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h, representing a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure ridge forms over the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and start pushing tropical humidity north to the southwest part of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
Tropical humidity then with an approximate low pressure slope in the following days will cause massive rainfall in the southwest of the United States.
25 to 100 mm of precipitation locally will cause dangerous flooding, suti currents and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation to close to 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwestern United States, especially above most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm precipitation is expected.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions, due to the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall, flooding may occur.
Given the dangers of tropical precipitation, it would be very unreasonable to walk into the desert.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to become raging rivers, and storms will bring local shock winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure slope will bring strong local precipitation to some parts of the coast of southern California.
Total precipitation above 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller flows of sutures and skateboards.
This will be the first rainfall in the region.
On Sunday evenings and on Monday mornings, unique tropical overcrowds begin approaching Arizona, and on Monday evenings and on Tuesdays, the rain will spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to four corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic will begin to cool, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp temperature changes over short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the U.S. on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees Celsius between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, they will try to expand the summer heat again.
In most areas in the middle and east of the United States, a warm beginning is expected in October, with temperatures around 27 <0xC2><0xB0>C from the south to the northeastern part of the United States.
In New York City it could be 27 <0xC2><0xB0>C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows in the first half of October a high likelihood of over-average temperatures in the east of the United States.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s interview
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels Thursday's appeals statements by Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political patrols continued and voters interrupted regular programs with reports of a sudden Friday coup: an agreement mediated by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was intoxicated at her high school party and tried to dress her up.
Kavanaugh said in his excited statement that he was 100 percent sure that it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the event was watched by more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen agency.
The company calculated average tracking on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
Numbers for other broadcasting stations, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who watch in offices.
For comparison, it is a similar number of spectators who watch football matches in a play-off or awarding Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest attendance of all stations, with an average of 5.69 million viewers watching him during a day-to-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
The second was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
Interest continued even after the end of the meeting.
The main character of the Friday drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS on Friday morning captured protesters screaming at him as he was about to take a lift for a court hearing.
CNN broadcast live how he stood for a few minutes with his eyes folded and let himself shine.
One woman said, "I'll stand right in front of you."
“Do you think the earth is telling the truth?”
He also said, “You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and even before closing the elevator door added that he would say more at a commission meeting.
All cable and television networks later broadcast live when the court commission was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the vote of the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate were to be investigated by the FBI next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flakes partially convinced talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's vote was important because it was clear that without an investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit 'politicians'
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “politicians” about Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another talk with the prime minister on the title page, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to pick up their tariffs from each other was “absurd.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrested Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on grounds of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpsons, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the match.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs to CBS, police secured the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
Simpson, according to the police after the interrogation, admitted that Waydea was shot.
According to the lawyer, the bail was set at <0x24>350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge Coroner's office released a preliminary report stating that the cause of the death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Refugee Police Unit, the State Police Criminal Laboratories, the Southern University Police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for “drinking and endeavoring justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayde's death by team "shocked" and "shocked" him.
"That's what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
A volcano crawls ash in Mexico City
The ashes from the Popacatepetl volcano hit the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the volcano's activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was watching a number of drilling and quakes.
On social media, images of cars covered with a thin layer of ash appeared in some areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists recorded an increase in volcanic activity, which is located 72 kilometres (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a force of 7.1 degrees.
The volcano known as “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters clashed with law enforcement and thousands of people took part in competition demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence vote that divided Catalonia.
Regular policemen blocked a group of masked separatists who were throwing eggs and powder paint after them, which in the streets, which are usually flooded by tourists, created a dark cloud of dust.
Later there were also riots, for which the police had to use boots to calm down.
Groups supporting independence sang “We will not forget, we will not forgive” in the face of the protesting supporters of the union, who shouted “Long live Spain”.
According to the local press, 14 people were easily injured in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but is being celebrated by separatist Catalans, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
The majority of voters voted for independence, but their participation in the election was low, as the opposition boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting in polling stations across the region in violent strikes.
Independence-supporting groups remained outside Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
Eighty-six-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who with his wife participated in a separatist protest, said he no longer hoped for independence for Catalonia.
“We had one of the best moments last year.
“My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we are in a blind alley,” he said.
Despite the important, though close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence-supporting parties had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their best-known leaders either went into exile by themselves. they did not go out with the organizers, or they waited for the referendum.
Twenty-four-year-old driver Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone and said the conflict was dismayed by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression we are witnessing by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Car Crash Into House
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry house.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
In a moment, maybe someone shot the car out of the box.
Meng's strike secured Livingston's 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Mengy's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, who moved from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard only the second of the 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengy's hit proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team hasn't won the Premiership yet this season, and next Sunday will be the first Hearts to lose eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has extended a series of games without a defeat in the division to six games, so head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, hasn't yet experienced a defeat.
Livingston didn't take advantage of the chances against minor guests
Holt's team had to lead long before the goal, because his straightness caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow in the slide just passed Craig Halkett's head in front of the goal.
It was enough for homeowners to watch the Rangers play in front of them because they knew that guests could endure standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
A free kick was ordered against the Rangers and Livingston formed a squad, Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly sent Meng, who ran the ball in the middle of the penalty area and scored.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but home defense was impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly out of work.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman stopped Rangers Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow did not hit another standard situation in Livingston.
In the penalty area of Livingston, centers were constantly flown, which the players were constantly cleaning up, and two penalties came in – after Halkett’s attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and another by hand.
The "Phenomen" of Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and on their way upwards they still exceeded expectations.
Their style of play and the crew have barely changed since their return to the top, but Holt deserves great praise for the way the team has been exercising since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, leading a well-arranged defense, while keeping Meng in readiness for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all the time.
Rangers are lacking inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they no longer meet these standards.
Their end was a chaba – they only penetrated the home page once – and for the Rangers it should be a wake-up call because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is waiting for a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29), the sky was blue and everyone smiled.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They were discomforted over a number of topics including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police for security reasons prevented the crowd from meeting in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters in the vicinity who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people – many of them Kurds – were also heard protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
Controversial protests reflect the controversy of the visitor, which some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: cyclist dies in car collision
In London, a cyclist died in a car crash.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street with busy Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and soon an ambulance arrived, but the man was dead on the spot.
The deaths occurred just a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the scene of Saturday’s tragedy in an accident on Childers Street, when the driver crashed off the scene.
The Metropolitan Police said the police are now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses run along replacement routes and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in the crackdowns in a high-security male prison.
The riots erupted in the Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and still persist.
To deal with the riots involving eight inmates in one wing, specialized supervisors from the Tornado team were called.
The supervisors suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
A prison service spokesman said: “Special training of prison workers was undertaken to deal with the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six members of the staff were treated with injuries.
“We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend longer time behind bars.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the director of the prison ended after the attack on a prisoner in the hospital.
And last October, order units were called to the prison because of serious unrest, during which staff were attacked by balloon bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (a region where drought can benefit)
It’s not usual for Arizona to be hit by a tropical low-pressure hurricane, but it’s likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy overtakes the desert southwest and brings the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will travel directly through Phoenix on Tuesday and will bring rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service of the Phoenix said on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have retained the status of a tropical storm or pressure below 320 km from the Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane another 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitations of 50 to 100 mm, in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona places up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Panda, it is likely to fall from 25 to 50 mm, with local ridges up to 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, rain can be a blessing because the area has been affected by drought.
Floods are a very serious thing, but these precipitations may also help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States is just hit by a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona experience at least “extreme drought,” which is the second-highest category.
Hurricane Rosa's journey will first lead to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still on the strength of the hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, will then on Sunday morning be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm encounters the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus loses power.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation will be strong, representing a high risk of flooding.
“In the area from Baja California to northwest Sonoru, total precipitation is expected to be between 75 and 150 mm, with up to 250 mm,” says the weather.com server.
Rosa then travels as a tropical storm across Mexico to the north and on Tuesday morning arrives at the Arizona border, then passes through Arizona and on Tuesday evening enters southern Utah.
“The main risk of Russia or its remnants is expected to be very strong precipitation in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and desert southwestern USA,” the National Hurricane Center reports.
It is expected that these rains will cause deadly flooding and streams of debris in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four People Arrested for Attempt to Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, young men aged 17 to 20 were detained at night in the Radstock area.
Police are looking for witnesses who might have on their cell phone a record of what happened.
Trump Says Kavanaugh "has experienced vanity and anger" by Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the Democratic Party’s reckless and scandalous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "experienced the futility and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh said Thursday before Congress that he decisively and emotionally rejected the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her several decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford said in a hearing on her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that on that day, “Americans were witnesses to Kavanaugh’s greatness and quality and courage.”
A representative of his supporters from West Virginia said that “the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has excellent public service on his account.”
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to take part in mid-term elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump has said Democrats have opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
A Republican leader's adviser told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the Senate floor is expected by Friday.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims continues to increase
Authorities said on Saturday that after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were disrupted by huge waves that flooded beaches.
On the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, hundreds of people gathered at the festival, however, under the sunshine, up to six-meter waves hit the coast, killing many people and destroying everything that was in their way.
The tsunami wave was preceded by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the threat of a tsunami appeared yesterday, people continued to operate on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they fell on the waves behind the victims,” said BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in Jakarta.
“The tsunami wave did not go alone, it took cars, fences, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that before the coastal impact, the tsunami wave spread at an open sea speed of 800 km/h.
He said that some people fled to the trees before the wave and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster mitigation agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Consequences shook the coastal city even on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s strong earthquakes was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could have exacerbated the tsunami wave.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found shackled under pieces of demolished buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of casualties and damages could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to him, the communication was "simply compromised without any information" from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its workers and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," the statement said.
The agency received considerable criticism on Saturday as it did not report that a tsunami wave had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time a warning was issued.
On amateur footage shared on social media, you can hear a man on the upper floor of a building screaming desperately warns people on the street from an imminent tsunami.
Within minutes the coast will hit the water wall, which takes away buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to verify the record immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
According to authorities, the army began sending freighter aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city was reopened only for transportation assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Saturday.
The number of tsunami casualties in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived in the city of Paul, where employees hid in shelters from buildings built in the yard of the office building, they saw images of destruction along the way, Doseba says.
“They said they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he added.
It's too bad.
When aid groups started their sad activities to help with disasters, some of them complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to Indonesian legislation, funding, supplies and staff from abroad may begin to flow in place of the calamity until a national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani.
“As soon as the government says ‘OK, this is a national disaster’, we can start international aid, but that’s not the case yet.”
When the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami occurred in Paul, friends and relatives of those who are still unawares still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that eased the cloudy stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the channel on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been imprisoned for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders at the Asian Games that ended in Indonesia this month.
Other people detained at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandag, were his students.
“As a person who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Mr. Gendon explained how in the hours following the paragliding community learned of the Roa Roa hotel collapse, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to competitors from Palu who attended the beach festival.
His messages, however, instead of a pair of blue highlights, ended with a grey mark.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he says.
Thieves Take <0x24>26,750 During ATM Supplement at Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport Police Department press release, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from Brink employees on Friday morning while replenishing the ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deposit additional money into it.
While doing so, another man “runs out of Brink’s employees” and stole a purse of money that was supposed to be deposited in an ATM.
Witnesses reportedly saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
Any information about the identity of the suspects should be notified to the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper Changed Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday, where he wrote: “The creature formally known as Kanye West.”
West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used the pseudonym as the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is due to release his new album Yandhi.
The show will replace singer Arianna Grande, who canceled her participation for “feeling reasons,” the show’s creator said.
West had previously said that the word for him, in addition to shortening the existing professional name, has also a religious significance.
“In my opinion, ‘ye’ is the most widely used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West let himself be heard earlier this year when he talked about his album with radio moderator Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
It changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to the only Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
Many other famous rappers have also changed their name.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brother love).
West's former collaborator JAY-Z also alternately wrote his name with an ally and without him and with both big and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
On the occasion of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the bloody intervention against students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza promised that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when the leftist student movement spread throughout Latin America, on October 2, 1968, soldiers began shooting at people in a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing as many as 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying out monthly scholarships to those studying and opening up other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education would drag young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. Should Double the Financing of Artificial Intelligence
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI expert who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and the US should double the amount they spend on research in the field.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government released announcements about AI, even though the U.S. as a whole has no formal AI strategy.
China, meanwhile, introduced a plan to be the number one in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double the budget for AI research would be a good start since all the other countries are farther away than the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chance that the next major AI discovery will be made in the United States.
Lee, who published his book “Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading AI<0x2B> companies in China.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that surpassed the best American player in Othello, and later he was a leading research worker at Microsoft and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants, according to Lee.
“Academic tip is not China, but corporations,” Lee says.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been employing the best experts from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
To improve AI efforts, according to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States.
“In my opinion, the holders of a doctorate in the AI field should be automatically offered green cards,” he says.
China’s State Council issued a new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Scientific Council and other government organizations are allocating money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
The U.S. Department of Defense this year set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a Selection Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing <0x24>2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF Foundation, it now invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
However, the U.S. legislation, which wanted to set up the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has been doing nothing for a number of months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether they want to change country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether the country should change its name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocks applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory, and therefore vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents object that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for the boycott raised doubts as to whether at least 50 percent of the voters would be delivered to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is the price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough members of Parliament said they would be guided by the result of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said that no problems were reported within 13 hours.
However, voter turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters eventually cast their vote.
“I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko cast their votes in a Macedonian referendum on the name change that would pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small stage and pulling chairs in front of tents built by people boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with a head up, not a door for service,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring as much investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
The “yes” result, he said, would be “a confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, the referendum could involve between 30 and 43 percent of voters – which is less than the required participation.
In another survey conducted by the Macedonian station Telma TV, it was found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must be concurrently 50% plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would mark the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its inception in May.

Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday set off Brighton's defense, securing Manchester City a 2-0 win at Manchester's Etihad Stadium.
In giving Aguera, his goal in the 65th minute seemed ridiculously easy.
It all started with a footage that the Argentine striker received in the middle of the field.
He sprinted between the three Brighton defenders and got into the open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green shirts.
On the outskirts of Brighton's penitentiary, one defendant walked around and several others advanced.
He found Sterling in the next footage on the left.
An English striker stuck the ball back in the penalty area to Aguero, who right-handedly beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the net.
“Aguero has leg problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We thought he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky to have scored at the moment.”
The initial advantage for the Sky Blues in this Premier League match, however, was arranged by Sterling.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory.
On the left he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to a remote bar.
The Sky Blues attacker threw the ball into the net just before slipping out of the playground.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the joy of Rockies
When the Nationals were excluded from the play-off fight, there were not many reasons to perform again.
But eternally competing Scherzer hopes that he will take the lead in a game against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday – but only when they have the Rockies who lead the NL West one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, hope for a play-off.
On Friday night, the Rockies secured at least a wild card with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals, but they still want to win their first title in the division.
“Although we’re not playing anything, we can at least start because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with the greatest effort I’ve ever experienced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play in it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are reportedly clinging to Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be his 34th start. He would train on Thursdays and train on Sundays when he is usually free.

Trump Speaks to Assembly in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president indirectly commented on the situation around his candidate in the Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to take part in the midterm elections.
“In November, everything we can do will be at stake.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important choices in our lives.
"It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but we're still on the move and I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see that it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to take over power by any means necessary, you see here vanity, resilience.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overwhelm to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we don’t give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, voted for “resistance and obstruction.”
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he added, adding that Democrats are “enraged and evil and resentful and inflamed.”
He mentioned the oldest member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to the loud beating of the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you bring out the document?
Uh, what?
No, um, no, wait -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse opinion stream.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinions.
When the activists from Momenta in my local party voted for my remark, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MEPs to say that they are not welcome – because they have honestly expressed their opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan and I were treated the same way because she was resolutely anti-Semitic.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on paradoxically similar issues, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Friday Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East stated that “we want the meetings to be accessible and productive.”
Most of the eight years I was a local MP for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday night were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today most of the meetings do not take place, and the promise of a “sweeter, more polite” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged as acceptable to the leadership of the Party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and my colleagues, who I used to think we had similar political views, all of a sudden expected me to turn 180<0xC2><0xB0> and take positions that I would otherwise not agree with, whether it be unity of the EU or national security.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – then there is a tyranny of social media outlets where they call for my appeal, condemn Wednesday’s politics, and tell me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments about me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a daily incident of sexist or racist insults, but will never quit.
One aspect of this era of politics that I am most disappointed with is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse stream of opinion, and with every proposal to express distrust or change the rules of selection, the party becomes more limited.
Over the past two years, I’ve been working many times to stay back, not so much, and then “I’ll be fine.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of the Margaret Thatcher government, which literally left my general school class to disintegrate, I have tried to fight for a better public service for those who are in need of the minister or the minister as a place.
I have never hidden my politics, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised by my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would only say that when the country is pushing for a Brexit that hurts households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
My main message, however, is not for the Moment in Nottingham, but for my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of any kind of revocation or political pragmatism will distract me from what I have to eat.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: The Undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two late fives slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly fun Tennent's Premiership game.
Now they're at the top of the table as the only defeat.
Ultimately, it was an excellent defense and better use of the chances, which helped the home to win, and coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be satisfied.
“In our games, we’ve gone through big tests and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says, “All the honours of Ayra, they took a better chance than we did.”
Grant Anderson's five in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Clime, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the number of overweights and Jason Baggot to gain an undisturbed turn.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by penalty and then scored exactly half-time and converted the solo test, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and the five Patrick Anderson, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who had left the playground on the benches, and when he started playing again, Ayr again leapt thanks to five Stafford McDowalls, which he transformed into Climo.
Deputy captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and Melrose used the players again thanks to the unchanged five of Bruce Colvin after a brief strong push.
However, the home runners returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for attacking Clima without a ball, MacPherson from a penalty shootout placed the ball behind Ayr's moving mall.
Climo changed, again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's tip and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth home five.
Star Still Game Launches New Career in Hospitality
The star of the Still Game series Ford Kieran seems to be moving into the hospitality industry. It turned out that he was appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 60-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he plays alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to an extract from the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper indicated that Kiernan wanted to engage in a “prosperous restaurant business” in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Inland Bolivia hopes to reopen court to the Pacific Ocean
The Marines are guarding the naval command in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
Over public buildings is a blue flag in the color of the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described by the slogan: “The sea is ours.
It is our duty to get it.”
Throughout inland Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coast that the country lost to Chile in the bloody 19th-century war on resources – as well as the desire to revive the Pacific Ocean.
These aspirations are perhaps the greatest in a few decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice, which should fall on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and peace and of course expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the MSD’s decision on large screens across the country in the hopes that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after many decades of interrupted talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate that Bolivia will be granted accession.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales, who has a controversial re-election battle ahead of him next year, is also interested in Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think it’s unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia—and even if it did, it wouldn’t have changed much.
This UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to assign Chilean territory to anyone and said it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the MSD’s decision comes just six months after the last arguments were heard shows that the case was “not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years not only did they not support the case of Bolivia, but perhaps they slowed it down.
“The issues of access to the sea have been seized by the current Bolivian government,” says Zárate.
He adds that Morales’ attacking rhetoric has weakened all the rest of Chile’s goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will once again start negotiating, but after this it will be extremely difficult to conduct discussions.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that court rulings were unusually fast.
On Monday, he will give Bolivia “a special opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the question of the sea as a political barricade.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Judgement is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never disarm their nuclear weapons first if they can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made to the summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart the nuclear diplomacy he has trapped at a dead end for more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri says it is “planning hope” that the ongoing sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean war could sometimes knock the North on its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously thinking that it will give up this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris tours show that the latest trend of giant head covers will soon arrive in your fashion stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of scratched giant head covers for their collections spring/summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats this summer flooded Instagram and these designers sent their exciting creations to the mule.
An exhibition piece from Valentina was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge reminiscent of a feather that flooded the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories were decorated melons, witch hats, and even pineapple – but they are not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One work resembled diving equipment with snorkeling and glasses, while the other looked like corned ice cream.
And if you keep going with the huge fashion, you’re lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could also reach fashion stores.
The overgrown hats come after "La Bomba", a straw with a half-metre-wide cream that everyone wore from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this very impractical hat, which flooded social media, sent to the showroom another huge creation – a muddy beach bag that is almost as big as a model in swimsuits that wears it.
The dark orange rape bag, laminated with rape tremors and equipped with white leather handles was an exhibition piece of the La Riviera collection spring/summer 2019 by Jacquemuse at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for next summer – since the designer had such a great success with them, it would be difficult to ignore the demand of the crowd.”
John Edward: Language Skills are Necessities for Global Citizens
Scottish independent schools have a number of academic successes and this continues in 2018 with other excellent exam results. Individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community activities just underscore this.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), and strive to provide their pupils and parents with the best possible level of service.
Independent schools are preparing their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually tailored school curricula, we note that modern languages are still popular and sought after subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes straight into his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart.”
It is a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year’s tests show that languages are in the top of the table, with the highest rate of success being achieved by independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language achieved the best scores of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that the highest score A was achieved by 72% of students of Mandarin, 72% of students of German, 69% of students of French and 63% of students of Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects chosen by students are considered in the curricula of independent and other schools as well as subjects of STEM (science, technology, technical disciplines and mathematics).
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the language skills are insufficient for reasons that employers refer to as vacant jobs.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more job opportunities require language, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whether a person chooses any career, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future that he has such a lifelong skill.
With the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a multilingual person automatically gains an advantage over the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to lead a conversation, with a single language spoken by a two-digit French-speaking group of 15 percent of people.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing economies, they will be more likely to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school is different by the language it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important to the UK in the outlook for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have a choice of several languages at independent schools with teachers who are experts in the given field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to ensuring an educational environment that prepares and equips children with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what awaits them in the future.
At this point, it cannot be denied that languages are essential for the future of the country in a global business environment, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should, in fact, be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and attractions to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to be featured in the Lakers suit for the first time on Sunday in San Diego
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James performing for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time are looking forward to it soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season in San Diego against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday.
It is not yet clear how many minutes it will take.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the pre-season.
“I don’t need a pre-season game at this stage of my career,” he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a wave of campaign performances at Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
It is the first of five milestones planned for next week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Due to the suspension of votes to confirm his candidate for a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans stand in the November elections before the risk of losing Congress.
What time does Trump’s performance start tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time, today on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s landmark in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court candidate, which took place this week and was very tense over charges of inappropriate sexual behavior. It is expected that a confirmation vote by the Senate will be postponed by a week.
But the main goal of this wave of rallying is to help Republicans gain momentum before the November elections.
According to Reuters, the organizers of the campaign, President Trump, said the five meetings next week were aimed at “adding energy to volunteers and supporters so that Republicans could try to protect and expand the majority of Senate and representatives in the Senate.”
“Control over the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible during this busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania" could be attending the meeting at today's Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and could be watched by the Pittsburgh media.
This will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, in which he gained more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to assist him in his investigations,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Its Stomach To Fight To Keep Hope Before Sunday's Singles
After three unilateral matches, the Saturday pair can be exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The hovering knot is a completely invented sports concept, but the players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
So where's the bucket now?
“They took six points and now it’s four, so we take it so that the knot probably moves a little toward us,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, it has four points and there are twelve remaining.
As Spieth says, Americans feel that they have a little wind in the sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the Spiethe and Justin Thomas form, who have played together all day and each can boast of three out of four points.
Spieth was deadly when switching from fireplace to green and is an example.
The festive screams further strengthened in the continuation of his lap as he managed the key pad to win the entire match when they were with Tomas after two holes in the back two.
His path, which won them a 15-hole match, encountered a similar thread that tells you that the American team is not yet out.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own match," Spieth said.
That’s all that each of these players left.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming couples from Europe are four out of four and can’t do anything wrong.
"Moliwood was the only pair that didn't hit the hole on Saturday afternoon, but passed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
The course and the way energy flows both towards a stormy audience and from it confirms that these are the players of the destiny for Sunday victory, and that by sunset over Le Golf National there will be no more favorite player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's best both at the same time in a different hole.
However, talks about European fame remain premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergi García, the hero of the four-ball morning game when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A cave and two dablys on the front nine buried Spain and Sweden in a ruin from which they no longer jumped.
No one will help you on Sunday.
The games of two pairs to two balls are so fascinating as you closely follow the interactions of people in the pair, the tips they give, the tips they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant leap until the last day, but this two-team game has also shown that the US team has a stomach for a fight that some, especially from the states, have doubted.
Until the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe scores 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage until the last day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's doubles game with a 10-6 jump over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who are said to have just won twice over matching Tiger Woods, decided to make four cuts at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to hold the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated the morning games for two balls with the American side, who failed in the series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, won two games, but couldn’t get into a deficit.
Jim Furyk needs eight points out of Sunday's 12 matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating players Woods and Patrick Reed in the two-ball game, Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau were even more vigorously defeated by 5&4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brightness, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in a doubles game for two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after a two-ball game in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a doubles game on the 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brookse Koepky - the one and the three in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not have to win the whole line on this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and returned later to defeat the Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a doubles game, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a double, although as a defending Furyk party, it only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems there is a Sunday counterattack behind them.
North Korea says it will not "defend" unilaterally and without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that the ongoing UN sanctions have deepened its distrust of the United States and in such circumstances the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual general meeting that North Korea has taken “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites and promising not to spread nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see an appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, it is not possible to disarm unilaterally at all.”
While Ri reiterated his renowned North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stupid" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every step, his statement appeared to be just as significant because it did not detract from Pyongyang.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war conflict, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also responded to calls for the release of harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure on sanctions to enforce its targets, and even opposes ‘declaring the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“I feel that sanctions can get us on our knees is the dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea and not the United States were on the side of this denuclearization issue, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would be in such a miserable situation.”
However, the tone of Rih's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's targeting of missiles on U.S. territory is inevitable after Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened the “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said much work had to be done and sanctions had to remain in place until the North collapsed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeframe for it, saying: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must continue vigorously and unceasingly until we are aware of complete, final, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously supports sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to suppress the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly and Pompeo announced that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July, declaring that progress had been made, only to declare North Korea within a few hours that he had made “gangster demands”.
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had informed him that the “appropriate measures” he hopes to take are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take part in a course that is designed to teach them enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all its students to sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studies overnight when students are not sleeping and are encouraged to take caffeine.
Academicians have found that students at the world’s most famous university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a female hospital, which is thought to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me that only now, in my last year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first presented this year, explains to students the basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to launch the course after finding that the students were really not asleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of student circuits where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In the other part, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
However, we think they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in “study all night” still exists, he added that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean there is also a growing problem of lack of sleep.
Enough sleep of good quality should be a student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even to prevent accumulation, because sleep deprivation switches the brain to hunger mode, so a person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Ceisler design a course that last year, during his first year at Harvard, graduated from one of his classes.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the entire course.
He hopes that the next step will require all graduate students to complete a similar study program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised students to consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can resolve your circadian rhythm problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga flooded Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy struck Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox attempted to record their first victory at St Johnstone from 4 to 1 February, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his eight-point position from leading Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes ago and the Rangers appeared to be without inspiration and determination to balance.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and immediately behind the Hibernian team as a single goal difference.
And there could be other Rangers problems after linear referee Calum Spence had to be treated with a head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from the scene.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, which moved around Ayr to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who last week picked up the Hearts point and would be delighted how his well-trained crew suffocated his opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have controlled the holding, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were supposed to score just two minutes after Menga left Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's side for the first time, but the backer buried his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' long free kick was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have a penalty for a quarter-hour run when he and Steven Lawles met, but referee Steven Thomson slipped the Colombian challenge from the table.
The Rangers managed only two shots at the target in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassana Coulibaly and the short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Liv’s opening could have been against the running of the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it already for the job.
The Rangers again failed to cope with the deep Jacobs set.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took Meng to the easy finish.
Gerrard took action at the break and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate result when the wing crashed into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly broke out of the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkett metals one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have deepened his jump in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to block Jacobs before Litgow broke out of the corner.
Rangers Deputy Glenn Middleton had another delayed penalty right when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson turned back again.
Almanach: The Inventor of Geiger's Readers
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old, and it is still growing... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger Reader.
Geiger Counter was also a constant pop culture at the time, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s reader, which is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: “Yeah, it’s really cracking!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Dangerous Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Dangerous Cells and Kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Dangerous Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can "see" the protein that is common to many cancers, and then re-injected
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells has been ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the laboratory, so they can "see" the protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-applied into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of several types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were taken from patients and “learned” to focus on cancer cells, has already been promoted in the treatment of type leukemia.
Kanye West participated in the pro-Trump sermon, in his mage hat, after his performance at the SNL.
It didn't go very well
Kanye West was shot in the Saturday Night Live studio after a confused performance, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing a third song called Ghost Town that night, in which he wore a Make America Great Again hat, he began swimming to the Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How much can you like Trump, that’s racist?’”
If I were to practice racism, I wouldn’t be in America long ago,” he said.
SNL began a parody show with Matte Damon in the lead role, in which the Hollywood star was joking about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of rape by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's theatrical speech was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to make West laugh.
West also complained to the audience that his head decoration had been well eaten in the backstage.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
That's a scam!
They also said I was in the wrong place,” the Washington Examiner said.
West went on to say, "Would you like to see the wrong place?" and added, "He'd put on his superman suit because that means you can't say what to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments only deserved the public’s beating at least twice, and SNL members looked depressed, dismayed, Variety says, and one person even said, “The whole studio is completely quiet.”
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West confused many of the attendees by singing the song I Love disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous characters: THANK YOU, YOU HAVE DETERMINED DAVID.”
But guest talk show Karen Hunter tweeted that West “was just who he is, and that’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I don’t want to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) that I believe represents and transmits to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he is now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague rapper, Snoop Dogg, used to be called Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was killed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The indictment is being reviewed by the State Prosecutor's Office.
Game Thrones star Kit Harington got into toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jonah Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasies of the HBO series.
The 31-year-old, however, stepped out of the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be claimed to deserve respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit said it believes “something is wrong” and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his star star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he is "slightly strong" on the issue.
“At this moment, I personally feel, quite strongly – what happened so badly to masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach teenage men about the problem we see here?”
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its highly male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What do boys learn on television, on the streets, in which they grow the feeling that every man needs to have his own side?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how to change it?
Because young men must have changed something for the worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel of Game of Thrones after the series was completed, because he already has enough "fights and horses".
From November, Kit will play in the restored True West of Sam Shepard, who is the story of the film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose for the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife while filming the show, so he gave me my future family and my entire next life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of love Kit's character Jonah Snow, in this fantasy series awarded an Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China says 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people have been affected by the virus in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads across parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 annually.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the country’s conservative values, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection during these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff would let GOP senators’ data escape, twisting the terms “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory”
U.S. MEP Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced claims that a member of her staff sent personal data to three Republican U.S. senators on the wikis of lawmakers.
A Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were backed by “ultratravagable” scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other repugnant lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included home addresses and telephone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on charges of sexual abuse by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leak came sometime after three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address that sourced the posts was linked to the Waters office and released information about Waters staff members, Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations - was under no circumstances responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly earned online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is annoying,” Fleischer wrote.
"It indicates that he has no temperament to be a member of Congress."
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He mustn't be resistant.
He must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
He needs to be calm and not be upset.”
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters’ reaction to critics of the Democrats towards Judge Kavanaugh, who were criticized for appearing too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who participated in the election against Waters, also expressed his views on Twitter.
“If it were true, it would be something,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had alerted “the competent authorities and authorities involved in criminal proceedings to these fraudulent claims.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are disclosed, and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English again hits reviews – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new movie with a British trend, which seems to be the case of this Johnny English revival in a series of action parodies - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this daring satire on the topic of how obviously a bad nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this twisted, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to repack it in a completely new way - that's the name more than any other signal that it's a wide comic creation intended for a non-English speaking cinematic audience.
Of course, he's the dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has some of Inspector Clouseau's spike, Mr. Bean's spike, and the big tempter of that guy who took a single tone in the 2012 Chariots of Fire sound at the Lond Game Ceremony launch.
The post is also originally based on a traveler and an internationally mysterious man, whom Atkinson once played in Barclaycard’s already forgotten television commercials, and who left chaos behind.
In this last edition there are one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blade briefly clinked his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exhibited, but humor feels quite under-dimensioned and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like a child than an adult, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy trampolines are as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gags in the person of Mr. Bean.
The current assumption is that the UK has serious problems.
The cyber-hacker infiltrated the British super-secret web of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground to intimidate the agent in service – a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is a pompous and enthusiasmful character who is already suffering from the complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays this noble Theresa May character as best as possible, but there is nothing in the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that once every active spy is threatened, she will have to bring someone back from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director at some luxury facility, but at the same time delivers a record lesson on how to be a secret agent: here are a few nice gags because English offers a spy academy similar to the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency bribe and met with his former long-suffering partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the submarine commander, an affected character who may be a little wasted with Vicki Pepperdine's talent.
So Batman and Robin are back in action and meet the beautiful woman fatally Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously subject to the charm of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the malicious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of freskin' patals: masked like waiters light up a French restaurant; create chaos when they crash onto Volta's luxury yachts; and English launches a pure anarchy when it tries to intervall with virtual possession.
All the aas are certainly ready for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and stormy, it has something of a children's TV in it.
It's a fairly moderate issue.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t have imagined: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labourers deny that they would develop a plan for the British to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is set to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants CEOs to hand over to workers the savings resulting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but still get the same reward.
Sources claim that this idea would “get” into the party’s economic agenda and plan to lean on the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A long-time Labour member told the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that falls into the party’s stance to balance the economy for the benefit of the workers and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is not currently endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not a policy of our party and the party does not take it into account.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to fulfill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to return energy from “anonymous directors” and “experts” in utility companies.
Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies do not have to return to their overall share because the Labour government could carry out “shocks” based on perceived guilt.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the company’s boards of directors and to create own funds that transfer 10% of private enterprises’ equity to employees who are eligible for annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in 60 Minutes, whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the findings of the office could push some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday's "60 Minutes", correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could uncover anything that would force them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more open than his colleagues from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the charge came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
However, Graham’s decision is inconsequential.
“I’ve already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and that would be an explosive accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those whom she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, offering a very impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
The seventh year of the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to meet in Central Park to not only enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is the end of the 20th year.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support poverty eradication by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To be able to get a free event ticket (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, e-mail to the world leader, phone call, or other meaningful ways to help them.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before it reached its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really in a way that convinces them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” – people who feel that by signing an online petition or sending a tweet will change something?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” on the part of its supporters, trying to achieve different goals.
He says these actions have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and measures of more than <0x24>37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group announced 390 commitments and announcements from its activities, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that insured funds still have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a British partnership of investors and realtors who are committed to “helping children grow to their full potential”, promising to provide Rwanda with <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 global tweets.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can only make a note of social injustice in the form of malnutrition in history,” Power of Nutrition project ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 events calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which addresses 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website with the question, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and hard journey – sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movement, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the top performers at this year’s New York year’s show hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval force to "block" Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington may “if necessary” resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy entering markets including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy as well as in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the opportunity, with the help of our navy, to make sure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, blocked, to make sure that their energy is not in the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is seen in the United States as the “voice of the energy consumer”.
He compared Washington’s approach to negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is to invest in or replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-purpose” player with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The announcement comes because the Trump administration is on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and has replaced Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to step down from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made of Berlin a “hostage” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is intended to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for developing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russia’s energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The United States took a position from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s largest industry organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supplies,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren vows to “closely look” at the 2020 presidential nomination, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the mid-term elections, she was "closely looking" at the presidential nomination.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top women’s position,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will look closely at the presidential nomination.”
During the meeting, Warren also mentioned Donald Trump and said he was “guiding this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am afraid to the bone of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most voters of Warren don’t think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidate.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with a potential candidacy by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin to meet Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after being listed in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through after his return, can be about other families feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are going back with,” she told an audience meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the detention an "elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans that they "return a little bit differently, go back in exile, come back, and ask if there is any respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the country, give to them.
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interference in reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in drunkenness, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports call for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal call for new measures by the U.S. government to deny asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from eighteen states and districts in Washington on Friday issued a brief report to support asylum seekers and question the measure, NBC said.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Organization against federal politics in August, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his sons and members of the violent gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing gang and domestic violence all over the world.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked the 2014 decision of the Immigrant Appeal Chamber, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of D.C. said in a statement Friday that the new measures “ignore decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” he said.
Lawyers have also briefly argued that a policy that denies immigration is damaging the U.S. economy, saying it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “add the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or because of political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been aimed at alleviating all the problems – not even all the serious ones – that people face every day around the world.
Expected rescue attempts in Palu, where the number of casualties has already doubled, race in search of survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
“It’s very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who was comforting her feverish boy in an evacuation center in the empty town of Palu.
“Every minute, the ambulance will bring more bodies.
“Clean water is rare.”
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up through conditioned things, and trying to save whatever they find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake were damaged.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rested at Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continued severe subsequent quakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he felt that a violent earthquake shook a hotel room on the fifth floor, sharing a room with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I think I was dragged into the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
Maybe they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Shipping’ Propaganda Advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper devoted to the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the China Daily fee paid in the Des Moines - the status of Iowa's biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in U.S. congressional elections on November 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials said Reuters was a new phase of Washington’s escalating campaign to develop pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to place commercials to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war that is manifesting at the level of mutual imports.
China’s retaliation sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to target exporters in countries like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican side, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor Iowy, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a statement on Sunday in the Des Moines Register that China is now doubling this bullying by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the precious American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in a newspaper stand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited disagreements and you will not see any real reflection of the disagreements that the Chinese might have on China’s disturbing economic path,” the party’s critics said.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers.
Republicans Leave Voters Before Elections for Debate with Kavanaugh, Analysts Warn
As many top Republicans defend candidate for Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several charges of sexual assault, the analysts warned that during the upcoming elections in mid-terms they will be aware of the response, especially from women.
Emotions about the case were extremely high, and most Republicans on record already say they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will at the last minute attempt to investigate the FBI will be enough to calm voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, head advisor and spokeswoman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, told D.C. on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is approaching!” at a demonstration in the hall of the Senate, where Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Commission decided to name Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say it’s been high, that’s true.”
But it could be higher, especially among the hesitant women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who don’t like the president, but often don’t go to the polls.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault on the Supreme Court’s candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, there could be an opposition.
"There was a confusing mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about voting in the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the chair, it’s also about how Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of US priorities, a group that helps vote for Democrats.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided in opinion, to whom to trust in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a bit more sympathy for the second named.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following pressure from the Flake FBI, he is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her her genitalia at a party during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet and Preview Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company Berners-Lee jokes that the goal of the Inrupt project is “global domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is exceptional about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it “personal authorization through data.”
The purpose of the Inrupt project is, according to John Bruce, CEO, to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the employees working on the project, collaborating on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about introducing a complete change, where all of their business models are turned upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in his media post published on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the website,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: A celebration of the spiritual who received Victoria's Cross during World War I
Celebrations have taken place a hundred years since the only spiritual Anglican Church won the Victorian Cross as a warrior during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received the award on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a shooter and he never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandchildren on Saturday unveiled a memorial stone for him at a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "generally symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Col Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense fog and a powerful fire from fieldworks and rifles.
He later entered the first line and led the line forward with the “highest courage” before throwing himself into the firefield and knocking three separate units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German gunner on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never do, but at the same time something that is humiliating.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, after a tour led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels a great honor to have been able to take part in the tour," adding that "the bravery of a true hero is manifested by the support that a lot of people will provide."
MMA fans stayed all night watching Bellator 206, instead getting a Peppa pig
Imagine, you’ve been waiting all night to watch the inflated Bellator 206, just to be denied the main event.
The San José account contained 13 points, including six on the main chart and live broadcasts in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other’s match, the audience in the UK was amazed when the news turned into a show about Peppa pig.
Some remained unmoved after waking up early in the morning due to the match.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in broadcasting for children as “a form of bad joke.”
“According to the government regulation, such content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., and therefore it is necessary to broadcast children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator after being questioned for the broadcast.
"Fuck Peppa, yes."
Bellator President Scott Coker said they will work on the program so that audiences in the UK will also be involved in the future.
“I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it,” Cooker said.
“But there are six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we can’t do it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and not all were very friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, the government could have done it.
I promise you, it won't happen again next time.
We reduced it to five games instead of six – as we normally do – and we tried our best to keep the promise given to the fans and we failed.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Invaluable' Because of Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority towards everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to pursue success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize until he was in high school that “not everyone is like him.”
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said he was less interested in winning the Olympics due to the possibility of becoming a parent.
Kirsty Young, the regular moderator of the long-running show, had several months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a midwife in Lavern's first program, said he felt "less valuable" than anyone else who grew up with him because "it wasn't socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
“Until now, these feelings of inferiority and differentiation were the real things that gave me the strength and the power to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “Someone,” he said not to disappoint anyone who would possibly find out how it was with his sexuality.
Twice the bronze Olympic medal holder became a high-profile LGBT rights fighter and used his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he responded because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and wants to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with the man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “has caught the unprepared.”
Daley married Oscar holder, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you were so young – he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it wasn’t easy to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June and Daley said he had "changed the whole point of view."
“If you asked me last year, it would be all in the style of ‘I want to win a gold medal’,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medalist is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't agree with him to die, and the last thing he asked was if they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the lead.
“I couldn’t tell him – you won’t be in the first place, Dad,” he said.
“I held him in my hand when he stopped breathing and until the moment he stopped breathing and he was dead, I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
One year later, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew I had dreamed about it all my life – jumping in front of our home at the Olympics, I don’t know how to feel better,” he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first song – Stream by Heather Small – that resonated with him at the start of the Olympics and still sparked the huesy skin in it.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended up on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson would hit the record on Sunday when he played 47 Ryder Cup matches, but he would have to match the form to prevent it from being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the events held every two years for a record-breaking twentieth, sent Captain Jim Furyk at Saturday's fourballs and foursomes on the bench.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as it used to be in the U.S., the five-fold winner spent his day alternately between applause and playing in a series he hoped to fix what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most straightforward of drivers, even at the height of his career, so it’s not an ideal choice for a narrow Le Golf National pitch where a long-membered field routinely penalizes bullets.
And if the golf course itself is not worrying enough, Mickelson will face precise British Open champion Francesca Molinari in his ninth Sunday match, which won all four of his matches this week in a team with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, avoided a quick start, the Mickelson sword could prove to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man and did not add anything else.
"He fully understands the role he had today, he stabbed me in the back, he put his hand around my shoulders and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“You have so much faith.
He is a member of the House of Commons and has been very helpful to these teams in the past week.
I can't imagine he's playing two swords.
I imagined more, but that's how it developed, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record in most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson scored 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence on the team brought some immaterial results.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he’s fun with people and he’s a great partner in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun when they followed him this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn says big leadership may soon disappear
“Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the great leadership leading to the singles from the last days of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane debuted at the 1997 Valderrama game, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point jump over the Americans, but they got to the finish line with a completely close win of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You still have to remember that we had a big jump in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only close,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching when in 2018 they won the 10th and 6th National Golf in Leicester.
So history and every member of the team showed me that it's not behind us.
Tomorrow you will be completely bored.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not for you until all those points are on the table.
We have a goal, and that's how we try to win the trophy, and that's what we're focusing on.
“I said I would focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand for on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with how his players led on a complex golf course, added: “I would never have done it.
There is another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and it is very difficult.
It’s great to be out with a partner when it’s okay, but when you have to be there for yourself, your golfer’s capacity is fully tested.
This is the message you have to pass on to players to get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of him.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players play better as individuals than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these big turns when he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn to end up defeated when Europe reached the "Wonder in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he said, when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players to aim for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to start as fast as in Brooklyn, as in Medina.
When this pace goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
So we set up the setup and make sure the boys feel like you know we're supposed to have magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack and confront Rory McIlroy in the top game with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the top half.
“I went with that group of boys in this order because I think it covers the whole trip,” Bjorn said of his choice of singles.
Germany's new warship has been postponed again.
The newest German naval frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and snowy coastline, local media say.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, was postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper citing the spokesman of the army.
The ship was to become part of the navy in 2014, but the demanding problems after the delivery have displeased the fate of this ambitious project.
As a replacement for the Bremen-class aging frigates, four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels, which were ordered by the navy in 2007, will be used.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with a powerful unit, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft ballistic missiles, and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include a long maintenance period – it should be possible to deploy the latest fregats for up to two years outside the home port.
Continuous delays, however, mean that top naval ships – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas – will become obsolete by the time they are put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The notorious F125 frigate got into the newspaper last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the manufacturers after it was handed over.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software errors and faults on metal elements" flaws, which made the warship unusable when deployed.
The software failures were particularly significant because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors – which is half of the workers needed on the Bremen class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate ship will be twice as heavy as the class-like ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the lack of metal elements, the cost of the entire project – including the training of the crew – is also a problem.
It is said that from the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion, the price has risen to a turbulent <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates have gained importance, especially in light of recent warnings that the German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, confirmed that the naval army was indeed “coming ships capable of deploying.”
This spokesman said that the problems had been continuously mounted because the old ships had been decommissioned but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates were able to become part of the naval equipment.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Neptunes
A new research is being carried out at the Scottish Highlands settlement to reveal how wild boars use the countryside for food hunting.
There is hope that the findings of research will shed new light on the behavior of unique mammalian flying and help manage future activities to preserve this species.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will monitor non-predatory birds and the smallest and watery browns in the Inverewe Gardens Botanical Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the key areas of this pig habitat, which will monitor the activities of piglets throughout the whole season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
A professional sound analysis of all recordings detects the frequency of neoprene calls and what individual species do.
Subsequently, a habitat map and a report will be issued, which will create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’ Natural Resource Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to non-smokers and how the individual species use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating a meadow, and best practice in maintaining forested areas for non-predators and other related species.
The number of populations in Scotland and the whole of the UK has been declining greatly in the last century.
They are endangered by the construction and territorial development that affect the colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as mosquito traps and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks may also pose a risk.
Non-bearers are not actually blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use intelligent echo-location technique to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the octopus very seriously.
He has trained professionals who regularly carry out surveys, colonies checks and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has even established the first and only reserved intemperate reserve at the headquarters of Threa in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten species of intemperate in Scotland.
Headquarters manager David Thompson says it’s the ideal area for them.
"Here in Threa, we have a great area for non-natives," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there’s too much we don’t know about the non-smokers, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
It emphasizes the importance of controlling neptunes before starting maintenance work in real estate, as it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one nursery can kill up to 400 females and youngsters, which can destroy the entire local population.
Pigs are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disrupt or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to put their hands on the work and help.
She said, “We have a lot to learn about our piglets and a lot of species that we don’t know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and his lawyers are about to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “false news” and said people “wanted to be visible” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which reported on these charges.
This Portuguese and Juventus assailant was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorgy in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her <0x24>375,000 to remain silent about the case, the newspaper Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after the charges were released, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers and labeled the information as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time Golden Ball Award winner in the camera.
“They want to live in my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their work.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are about to sue the newspaper Der Spiegel for unsubstantiated allegations, which they called “an unacceptable notification of suspicions in the private sector.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damage to an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times.”
The alleged incident was supposed to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel suite and at a Las Vegas casino.
After acquaintances at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the game, where she was allegedly raped by the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down after the alleged incident and told her that he was disappointed at “99 percent” and “one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that he had paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also says she went to the police and let her take pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to extrajudicial treatment because she was "fearful of revenge" and feared "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman claims she is now seeking to resume the trial because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo has been charged with a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid and was bought this summer by the famous Italian club Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: the UK will regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Greg Clark, the company's secretary.
He said it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“A deal is necessary,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of a border delay in the event of no Brexit agreement could cost jobs.
At the Burnaston plant, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis cars are manufactured, they produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if the UK suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would record a halt to production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other cars, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fears of leaving the EU without a deal on the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini production plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers refer to as risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is “right on time” and parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU are delivered for cars made to order within 37 minutes.
If the UK left the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there could be a breakdown at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and lack of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have in stock more than one day at Derbyshire, the company said, and there would be a drop in production.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plans to revive future EU relations are "exactly calibrated so that these border checks do not take place."
“We need a deal, we want the best deal, which, as I say, will enable not only current success, but also capture this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The proof not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful supply chain set.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be halted, but in the long run it warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is the chairman of the trade unions at the plant, said that the members of the trade union organization are increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these places disappear, they will never return.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “deposed by the next week” as the fight for the post of Supreme Judge with Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller’s special council investigating interference in the Russian elections, the ties between Trump’s supporters and Russia, and a possible judicial obstruction by the president.
Whether Trump releases a deputy general, threatening Mueller’s independence, Washington’s talks have been saturated for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of interfering with the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he entered the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he would not "prefer" release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a hearing at the Senate Judicial Committee, where Kavanaugh gave testimony and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the full vote of the Senate again.
Trump's press spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared in news on Fox on Sunday.
Asked to meet Rosenstein, she replied: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, it may need to be postponed by another week, given everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and will always communicate up-to-date information to the media.”
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said too few press conferences were not caused by aversion to the “theater” of television reporters, although she said, “I do not agree with the fact that she will perform.”
She subsequently suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him,” she added, without giving any evidence. “We looked at those numbers.”
The conference will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than talking to me.
“We’re trying it out and you’ve seen that we’ve been doing it in the last few weeks and there’s going to be a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with attending senior officials.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre appearance before the gathered reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland not to be afraid of Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter not even six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to pay the costs of applying for the settlement status of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “At the end of the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU are continuing, and they are heading towards the expected decisions this fall.
However, the UK government is also taking steps in preparation for a possible withdrawal without an agreement.
I know it must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to assure you once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to patients and the communities to which we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our warmest wish is that you stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee defender Christion Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a Saturday's 31-27 defeat to rival Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the side line and just fell there,” Reed said.
Coaches and health care professionals gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines and then put it on the carrier and prepared for further evaluation.
A Tennessee official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details of the type/range of injury are yet available” and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a pair of red shirts, completes the first season for the state of Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday, he had five total operations, which means a total of 18 operations per season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when buying a property in the UK, and the money will be used to help homeless people as part of the new Tory plans.
This act will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s move, which aims to attract young voters
Increased taxation of higher property tax will be paid to non-taxable persons in the UK
State Treasury is expected to increase by <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Overseas buyers will pay a higher tax on the purchase of a property when they buy a property in the UK, and the money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s pull to attract young voters with a promise to provide more affordable accommodation and focus on people with high incomes.
Increasing taxes on real estate purchases will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, while money will further strengthen government efforts to fight sleep without a roof over their heads.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current obligation to pay taxes on the purchase of a property, including the higher levels introduced two years ago at other homes and the purchase for rent purposes, may reach up to three per cent.
It is estimated that the State Treasury will raise funds by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
According to estimates, newly built properties in London are being purchased by 13 percent of non-U.K. residents, which drives out prices and makes it easier for those who buy for the first time to get on the staircase.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spirit cities” precisely because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new rules emerged just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut on property purchases to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by occupying land but not exploiting it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to fix the “house-lessness” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rentals and the closure of "indispensable" emigrants.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new houses.
“Last year, I said I wanted to dedicate my efforts as prime ministers to the restoration of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make life here.
However, it cannot be fair to make it easy for entities not living in the UK and for foreign companies to be able to buy homes as well as hard-working UK residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away and the drowning of sleeping without a roof over your head is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "highest ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of renewing the northeastern club, which currently holds third place in the Premier League, just three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after St Mirren brought back the Scottish Premiership league last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the value B and it was," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that draws me back.
But such an opportunity would only come if I were successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's managers were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he didn’t feel any anxiety about the succession of such names in such a big club when he previously rejected pre-games from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success would be a question for me at the time whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Due to the structure and equipment in this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him back there, but I think I'd be successful if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only had a career in leadership for three years, previously serving as an assistant boss at Dumarton and spent 15 months as a Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling to the third group and transformed St Mirren from the start of the fall to the championship winner immediately in the following season.
And Ross says he's feeling much better now than he's ever had in his career players at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“They were probably real crossroads,” he recalls the time when Alloa was engaged.
“I really believed that leadership was right for me, more than playing.
That sounds weird because I was good, I made a good profit, and I enjoyed the proportional heights.
But playing can be challenging.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through them in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good in leadership.
“I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, I feel like I’ve felt the most in my skin in my entire adult life now.”

Research found that a great time at the pint is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer wave of wetlands increased Britain’s hard-working household income, but increased pressure on a chain of restaurants.
The figures show that groups of pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July – but restaurant revenues declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA’s consulting firm, which produced the final reports, said: “Stable sunshine and more than England’s expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar formula than the previous June, when the restaurant would have increased by 2 per cent, but increased by 2 per cent.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June worsened in July.
Gentlemen and bars attracted to drinks have so far behaved most strongly in the same way that restaurants have deteriorated.
Lords, whose main revenues are from food, also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent per month, while food sales fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst at leisure and hospitality, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of significant social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurant chains continue to fight, although the annual sales decline of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in light of ongoing cost pressures.
A long hot summer can’t be a worse time for food-loving business operators, and the time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring so much needed relief.”
Total sales growth in farms and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK host, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, which is the industry-leading industry benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – aged just 11 – have a secret social media account that hides from parents and educators, according to research.
Research among 20,000 high school students showed an increase in “false instagram sites”
Reports Increased Concerns About Sexual Content Publishing
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that parents know about.
One in five children, aged just 11, create accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “false instagram accounts” that share photos.
Reports indicate concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they have an embellished “main” account that their parents know about, and at the same time they have a private account.
One mother, who hit her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website, found that her teenage daughter was urging others to “rape her.”
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) association of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, with half admitting to running private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most prized lightweight athlete and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who are in the leadership of the sport as those who will benefit from its far-reaching international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has extensive respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that it will be very beneficial for athletics in Scotland to be a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be really beneficial and to help lead sports in Scotland.”
The American who won at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics at the 200 and 400 metres won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, unable to walk after a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I carried out an attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show if I'm recovering or to what extent.
It’s exhausting, but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again and I can do exercise today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!”
Milk vacuum cleaner comparing mothers to cows shares opinions online
The company that manufactures vacuum cleaners has shared online opinions with advertising that compares breastfeeding mothers to breastfeeding cows.
As part of the launch of the “first silent portable vacuum cleaner in the world”, consumer technology company Envi has released a music video with an overlay showing the freedom that the new vacuum cleaner gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ashes with cows on a song with the words, “Yes, I am tired, but you don’t see any tails” and “If you haven’t noticed I have no feces, my breasts are here.”
The congregation goes on to say, "Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I power my sweet milk."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked online controversy.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of whom said it shed light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very poor decision to abuse cows for advertising this product.
Just like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth to give birth, but their babies are taken a few days after giving birth,” one of the comments said.
Elvie Vacuum Cleaner Discreetly Dedicated to Breastfeeding Breast (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and the child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise on the breast pump for the mothers who leave their children?”
Someone else added, “This advertisement is completely out.”
There were also those who defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that the song was considered "contagious".
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I'd get that pump if I were still swallowing.
When I suck, I feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but it's all right.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another added: “It’s a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who suck up milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not advertising to praise or curse the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they are all dancing with discreet vacuum cleaners hidden under the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that many women who drink milk say they feel like cows.
The Elvie vacuum cleaner, however, is completely silent, has no wires or scissors and hides beautifully in the breastfeeding bra, so it gives women freedom of movement, the ability to hold the child and even walk when sucking.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD for mothers, added: “Elvie’s vacuum cleaner is so revolutionary that it deserves a distinctive and provocative launch on the market.
By creating a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and breastfeeding cows, we wanted to point to the absorption of milk and all the challenges associated with it while showing the fun and reliable sense of freedom that the new vacuum cleaner will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's vacuum cleaner has gotten to the hearing.
During the London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers, designer Marta Jakubowski, appeared at the mole, which had just been using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to camp on Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, especially because the harsh rhetoric and principles set up by the Trump administration have made it easier to place children with escorts.
Most of the accompaniment was traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants who were afraid of threatening the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Department, testified through Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had applied for the status of escorting single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no previous criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of sponsors’ households are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we're continuing their prosecution," said Mr. Albence.
According to asylum workers, representatives in an effort to expedite the processing of matters concerning children have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a month prior to their detention, instead of the earlier standard 60 days.
Many will appear through videoconferencing calls rather than in person to declare their case as a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who do not have the right to help will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely he is to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape, say asylum workers and report from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers state that these concerns are heightened in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is suffering, more likely to be unnoticed, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that relocating children to a camp without enough time for emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends could cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria has announced that the US, French and Turkish "occupational elements" will be withdrawn immediately.
During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual also called for the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, even though the eighth year of war in the country is already underway.
Moual, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces in Syria are illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that “it will be charged accordingly.”
“He must give up immediately and unconditionally,” he said at the assembly.
Moual insisted that “the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over,” with more than 360,000 people dead and millions more losing their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy battle until we get rid of all Syrian territory" of terrorist groups and "any illegally present aliens."
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria, mainly training Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of war-conquered countries.
At the time of the release of refugees, Moualem said they had good conditions for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational concerns" that caused the refugees not to return.
“We have called on international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery aid will be available to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a protective zone at the last Idlib shelter has created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a major attack by Syrian forces protected by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
Moual, however, pointed out that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military action would be directed at jihadists, including the Nusra Front militants, who are tied to al-Qaeda, who “will be wiped out.”
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meeting of a new committee of members of the government and the opposition will be held to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee with the words that the work of the panel should be limited to "control of the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning against prosecution.
Why Trump wins in the second half
According to this logic, Donald Trump would win another election in 2020 if, as many liberal observers probably hope, the accusations and scandals did not end his premature office as president.
In such a case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency in history!”
So far, there are no signs of fatigue being monitored.
Since 2014, tracking over mainstream time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewing of 2.4 million in mainstream time, an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has increased the viewing on cable to 3.5 million viewers from mainstream nightclubs.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the host of Designated Survivor on ABC's drama about a cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, an experienced author of the comedy and show "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked
"He said, 'Because he's having fun with him,' said Mrs. Scowell to me.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story taking place in Washington could pre-determine the future of Roe v. Wada, whether immigrant families can reunite and benefit the global economy.
Finishing is a luxury that can only be afforded by the most privileged viewers.
And yet it’s beyond whether you’re an informed citizen by watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses “deep backup” resources for his Washington book “Fear,” writing “Post” of Paul Manafort’s leather jackets, and writing a <0x24>15,000-dollar tale of Daniel’s (<0x24>15,000 in stock).
I’m not going to look at Super Maria again in the same way.
“Part of what he does and what triggers the feeling of a reality show is that he’s feeding you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chairman of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of Pawn Stars’ documentary about the rotating N.F.L. Trump show in which he appreciates Kim Chong-una.

He could not break apart, even when Brett Kavanaugh set up a Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in trouble.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money flows out to the closest domestic races of the mid-term election
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a financial influx thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, which generated two holders of the office in the fight for the same chair.
This recently led to the transformation of the suburban district of Pittsburgh by Democratic District Republican Conor Lamb – who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another holder of the office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is strongly overlapping with the new 17.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, maps were distorted.
The race in the new 17th district started a sharp financial divide between the financial branches of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became well known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March following special elections to the 18th congressional district.
This chair has been occupied by the Republican for more than a decade and Donald Trump has won 20 points in the district.
Politicians are giving Democrats a slight boost.
US considers punishing Salvador for supporting China, subsequently resigns
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under moderate pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until his partners judicially displaced the Trump leadership’s organizational team.
Foreign ministry officials have decided to revoke U.S. diplomatic mission directors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan further,” ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
But the fines were only considered against Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included shortening financial aid and focusing on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of murders.
With ongoing internal negotiations, North American and Central American representatives postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity following similar negotiations from the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in the U.S. efforts to prevent migrants.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials clarified that they want to continue negotiations and effectively end any pending fines for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now entrusted with a solution to the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of a signal that the administration puts on talks, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without having any new unbroken news from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on conditions of anonymity.
Their sources have been confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the government executive and has also spoken on condition of anonymity.
History of the study
A definite nail in the cage could be Robert Mueller’s report from a special commission on the possible deterrence of Mr. Trump in law enforcement, which is now much evidence in the public records.
In his investigation, Mr. Mueller also allegedly refers to whether Mr. Trump’s campaign contained a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
If there was an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to apply for office before this body, as he is preparing to appear before voters again, and in the end, he would be expected by a jury made up of his colleagues.
This is an entire “if” row, and I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – as is the case with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice ahead of us that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, only enough for the Western powers to stand up and support him in Munich Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that accelerate or slow down the relentless course of democracy.
Americans are now facing a number of similar critical moments.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been upset about this since the report announced last year that he had proposed to secretly record the president and speculated that he was not in good health in order to stop the presidential office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the Times versions are inaccurate.
“How do we respond if the newly requested investigation by F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or what if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite convincing allegations of sexual assault and false statements?
And most importantly, will we vote in mid-term Congress to assign responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will wait for a long dark night.
But I do not believe that we will settle, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me on Saturday to light candles on the table with a swastika.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such a legacy?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the collision with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that the victory over Raku<0xC5><0xA1>ana would give them great hope for progress from Group G of the European League after an impressive rebound in Spain at Villarreal earlier this month.
The knee injury prevented defender Graham Dorrans from appearing on the pitch for the first time in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a reflection bridge to bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went to the game with the belief that we could get something out of it, and we took the point.
We might have been able to reproduce it at the end, but overall the remix was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we improved and we were better again.
Thursday will be the next big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be hard, because they paid a good result in the last game, but with the spectators behind their backs I'm sure we can push and it's going to be good.
“Last year was pretty hard, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but now I feel really good about it.
The team is strong and the guys really enjoy it, the training is great too.
"I hope we'll stick to that right now, we'll be heading for last season and we'll be successful."
Women Are Worried About Retirement Savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people talked about it with family members.
Approximately half of the people in the nationwide study stated that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t decide to discuss it with him,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the state-wide life insurance company.
You can start this way.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare the family to provide care unless you reveal your wishes to them in advance.
Together with your counselor and family, learn where and how to take care, because these factors can play a big role in determining the price.
Call your financial advisor: The advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, for example, by means of traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance that will help you pay for these expenses, or by means of self-insurance using your own funds – as long as you have money.
Create your own legal documents: Prevent legal battles as long as possible.
Identify a health care representative, which will be a trusted person who will supervise your medical care and ensure that doctors comply with your wishes if you are not able to communicate on your own.
Also consider writing full power for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid in case you are not eligible for this.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your old parent is necessarily in need of a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“There are not only finances in the game, but, for example, what are the names of nursing doctors?” asks Martin.
“Where are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
“Let the plan be prepared by hand.”
A man in Ilfracombe was shot several times from an airbag.
When the man returned on foot after the night shift, several bullets from the airbag hit him.
The 40-year-old victim was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 p.m., as a “accidental act.”
The victim of the assailant did not pay.
Victim injuries are not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in the severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, which is expected to continue to increase.
As communications are out of service, auxiliary units were unable to obtain any information from the regent of Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is close to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are a few key facts about the city of Palu and the regentship of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 miles) along the coast on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region under the provinces, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic components of the province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also significant in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency, the tsunami has hit Palu and Dongal several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami in Donggal killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami struck the west of Donggala in 1996, when she claimed nine lives.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Circle of Fire and there are regular earthquakes here.
Here is a list of the biggest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh Province.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake struck southern Indonesia's most populous island of Java and caused a tsunami that struck the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, and caused a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and prepared the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake hit the Pidie Jay regent in Aceh province and caused destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastating effects of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 died from falling buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake struck Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin, a 29-year-old resident of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violation of domestic violence reports and preventing arrest.
According to police reports, when his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin picked up her phone.
Palin was sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is detained on an uninsured bond of <0x24>500, KTUU reports.
According to the network's report, he appeared in court on Saturday, saying he felt "decisively innocent" when asked to comment.
Palin faces three A-Class offences, which means he could be sentenced to a year of detention and a fine of up to <0x24>250,000.
At the same time, he was charged with a Class B offense, which is sentenced to one day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has faced a criminal report.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently before an Alaska war veterans court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, violation of reports of domestic violence, and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotic drugs in connection with the incident.
He allegedly hit his girlfriend in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of war veterans as she linked her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication networks are out of service and the number of casualties is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck a part of the island of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, there were videos depicting the moment of disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Extraordinary Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – an exceptional punishment that has not been awarded for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly carried out an attack on a cycling trail along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan district in October using a rented Home Depot truck that blocked pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a number of injuries - this is how the terms of the intent to grant the death penalty are defined according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York court.
According to the court documents, both of these figures would mean the possibility of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including, for example, charges of murder in favor of rape, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and charges of motor violence and rape.
The attack required “significant planning and preparation,” the prosecutors claim, describing the way Saip’s act was carried out as disgusting, cruel, and repulsive.”
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injury, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendozy, and Alejandra Da Vyamian."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York court last issued the death penalty.
Accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out in connection with a federal case in New York City in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, who were shown conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War of two years.
Both Rosenbergs sat in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has expressed minimal regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to the allegations, Saip told authorities that he was inspired by watching Islamic State videos on the phone to carry out the attack.
Police also said they also demanded the hanging of the Islamic State flag in the hospital room.
He said he felt guilty about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public advocates representing Saipo, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of admitting guilt and life sentences without the possibility of being released only prolongs the trauma of these events for everyone involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s lawyers had earlier asked the prosecutor not to demand the death penalty.
MEPs say Conservative Party should be responsible for Brexit negotiations NIGEL FARAGE
During today’s protest, Nigel Farage pledged to “mobilize the army of the people”.
The former leader of the UK’s Independence Party said politicians must “feel pressure” from Euroskeptics – as one of its own MPs, Theresa May, suggested, should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain "would be out now" if he were Brexit secretary Mr Farage.
But the problem that Mrs May faces in reconciling her ranks, where there is a deep split, has been further highlighted by conservatives fighting for staying in the EU, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her Chequers compromise plan under attack by Brexit supporters, stay-at-home supporters in the EU and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that they will continue to try to negotiate with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone said the Leave Means Leave group was gathering in Solihullu, where he wanted to “go to the Chequers.”
He proposed to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out today,” he said.
Wellingborough said: “I’m going to stand for Brexit, but we have to go to the Chequers.”
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought world wars in order to have to listen.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone rejected proposals that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to stay is absolutely pathetic.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns, who also took part in the march, told reporters: “I’m simply saying: Mrs. Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition won’t vote for him and he’s not liked by members of our party or our activists who are currently filling the streets to be elected at all.
Forget the Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp report for Ms Maya, she says: “The Prime Ministers will retain their seat if they keep their promises.”
Farage said conservative politicians must “get into an unpleasant situation” if they want to betray their decisions taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We won’t let you.’”
In a statement to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betrayal of Brexit, to feel pressure.
“We are now mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has secured us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent and proud of Britain, which rules itself.”
Proponents of the stay in the Union, meanwhile, marched through Birmingham and then organized a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A number of activists have had anti-Brexit protests by the Conservatives since the party’s weekend operation began.
Labour MP Lord Adonis laughed at conservatives over security issues with the party's application after the conference began.
“These are people who, in their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a whole phrase.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘think’ the presidential nomination
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the November election, she would “think about running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking a November re-election against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of Trump’s campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which also means a woman in the highest position.
He was arrested for shooting Sims from LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., on Saturday said they had detained a suspect in the Friday shooting of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 Conference ET news.
A video of Friday's shooting was released requesting the identification of the man captured on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head that did not coincide with his life," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the media on the 247sports website on Saturday.
Wayde tried to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was moving on the scene, had a gun, and also admitted the shooting of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot and 6-inch Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, 10 of which were last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of World Champion when his team director wins over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished in Saturday's qualifying against Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes's team direction would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the field position, and Hamilton almost got rid of it when he defended his position in the first two laps and challenged Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the deck and allowed Hamilton to pick up the cars rolling on the group's tail, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider entered the deck a few days later and after the departure, he ranks behind Vettel, however, Hamilton went ahead and in a tight fight, the Ferrari rider had to unwillingly leave the inner trail free in order to defend himself in the third lap.
Max Verstappen left the rear row and was in the lead at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race because he held the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the quick finish and was able to take Kimi Raikkonen fourth place.
In the end, he made his debut in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he was no longer able to increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri's been doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he was acting like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done a fantastic job and the reward is the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday because she insisted she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a West Virginia assembly, he did not directly mention Ford's statement before the Senate Judiciary Commission, instead stating that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad and resilient and inflated."
"One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see the people being angry and evil and resentful and inflamed," he said.
“When you look at publishing and publishing and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you take the escape?
Remember her answer... you published the document – ah, ah, ah, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... No, that's not," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent Ford’s letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information escaped early in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak would come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, nor did I disclose any information about the case,” Feinstein told The Hill.
“She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do.”
However, her words seem to have been disbelieved by the president, who spoke at a meeting on Saturday night: “I will tell you that this is a serious body language.
She may not have done it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court judge, whose three women accused of sexual harassment, and indicated that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power back by any means available.
“You see this disgust, this disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drown in the country to get back to power and to the throne,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars scored a Friday loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning a Saturday rematch in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The Giants soon took the lead due to the interventions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to settle for home before Dwyer returned to the Giants.
Francois Bouchard then compared Dundee again, with Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals insured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for team Adam Keefe, who managed to beat 2-1 at Belfast Dundee on Friday.
Both teams met for the fourth time in the season, with all three previous matches controlled by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with Kendall McFaull assist, while David Rutherford attributed his assist to Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got his home back in the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie, who was comparing at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the cabin on the first break, after all, only in the lead, when he scored his second goal in the evening at the end of the first quarter.
The homers regrouped, and Bouchard managed to score again from the overstretch game at 27:37.
Cownie's and Charles Corcoran's joint work later helped Nielsen beat Dundee for the first time in the game and the same player secured his team's lead in the half of the final quarter.
The Giants, who have now lost the fourth of their last five games, will play another game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic chief dies to allow hundreds of people on board the plane to escape the earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller is celebrated as a hero after he died as he oversaw how to safely take off a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have disappeared after a major tsunami earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong subsequent quakes flooded the area and many people remained trapped in the hamlets of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that colleagues of 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung fled to save his life, he refused to leave his place in the wild refusing tower control at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the ranch at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped down from the control tower when he thought he was crawling.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared transport by helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which he was transported to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning even before the helicopter reached Paula.
“Our hearts are broken with this message,” he added.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the death toll could reach thousands, and the agency responsible for disaster management said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
"The number of deaths continues to increase as many bodies remain unreleased under the wreckage and many of them have not been reached by rescuers," Sutopo Purwo Nugroh said in a statement.
The waves in the devastated Palu reached a height of up to six meters. Mass funerals will take place in the city on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft are bringing aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances bring more bodies here.
There is a shortage of drinking water.
Small shops are stolen everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks necessary for evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that one person is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline operating the flight, which crashed in a lagoon on one of the microneous islands in the Pacific, has now stated that one person is missing, initially stating that all the passengers and crew reading a total of 47 people were evacuated.
Air Niugini said in a press release that she was unable to find a passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests to provide details of this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at an airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said Friday that a total of seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained on treatment on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact tracking of the events, however, remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had entered the lagoon before landing.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed from a very low altitude.
“It was very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that along with the others, he was able to get water through the deep belt to the emergency exits of the flying aircraft.
He also said that the crew was panicking and screaming and that he himself suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working near the harbour dock helped rescue by means of an inflatable boat transported by passengers to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, a total of 111 people have died in PNG-branded aircraft crashes over the past two decades, but no accident occurred to Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The indictment ended its speech on Saturday in the case in which the man is repeatedly convicted of burning a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours and provided expert assessments in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury analyst drew a script using the cell phone records of 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous statement, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the cell phone data showed that he had spent the night with Chambers, he found out that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who was then visited by the police.
Sanford stood before the court and testified that the day was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was lying, "because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis stated that he knew Chambers about two weeks before the day she died.
However, the cell phone records indicate that the two knew each other for just a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be brought before the jury later that day.
High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions about this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its inception with political messages and solving social problems.
Therefore, they want to go back to their roots and re-popularize conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have met with revival in the recent past thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?!
A New York educator sues a couple for her expulsion after a "racist" text message
A New York-based educator is suing a couple for her discriminatory expulsion after she received a wrongly sent text message from her mother, in which she was labeled as a “next black” text message.
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her concern when she found out on the first day of work in 2016 that her new child's teacher, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NEEEÉÉÉÉÉÉ, THE NEXT BLACK," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, Pi Maurice sent her twice.
When she understood her false passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman was so "concerned" that she discarded Mrs. Maurice and said that her schoolteacher, an African-American, was really working badly and that instead of her, she was expecting the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing some compensation for the job and demands compensation of <0x24>350 per day for the six-month engagement she was initially hired for, even without a contract.
“I want to show them that this is not happening,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
However, the two returned the blow with the fact that they were not racists, but that the termination of Ms. Maurice’s employment was an appropriate measure because they feared they could no longer believe her after that insult.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not racist.
We are not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you give your child into the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on.
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion" and said that his wife only cared for a two-month-old child and was in "very difficult situation".
“Would you drive after someone like that?
That’s not a good thing at all,” said the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the social media jury quickly condemned the couple for their behavior and logic.
Publishers of stories about the bear Paddington feared that readers would not identify with the speaking bear, recent reports show
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, told reporters: “It’s hard to feel the situation of someone who reads it for the first time, even before it’s published.
“It’s very fun to know now that we know Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, she added on the day of the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book, which became a "short-lived" book.
To Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of her family,” she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he was never shy,” she said.
“But because Paddington was such a real character for him, it was like you had a child who achieved something you can be really proud of.
I think he looked at Paddington's success with this view.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his achievements to Paddington alone."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louise Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
“He called me on a regular basis to tell me that it was really bad and that he didn’t expect it to get out of it,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I had a call from Nada, where she told me she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you dear.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart running slowly lose its effectiveness and leave her body.
She died shortly thereafter, and it was as if everything had closed.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in me.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers without revealing the difficult test she was going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
“I kept my head folded, they kept running through my tears all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was just during the summer when I felt an astonishing understanding of Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Troubled Women Send Postcards to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women, who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide, work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send Welsh Bridge postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers where people can search for support.
Mrs. Davis's son was only 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and as a result, he died at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any other parent to have to feel what I felt every day,” she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was given a young cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile was able to illuminate every room.”
However, even before his death, he left work because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his sibling’s immobile body after taking his life.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about how this will affect his life."
Mrs Davis suggested the postcard, “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and can talk to them, even if they are their friends.
Don’t sit still – you have to talk.”
Mrs Humphreys, who is a longtime girlfriend of Mrs Davies, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he felt at the bottom or depressed, nothing at all,” he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his behavior.
The worst thing was on Christmas Day – when the kids opened the gifts, not even looking at them, nothing.”
She said that her partner’s death was a huge trauma for them, but that she had to gradually get over it: “This kind of thing can make a complete hole in the family.
It broke us.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought we could get something that we actually asked for – an investigation at the time of limitations, with a limited scope – we could put a little bit of unity into it,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee would “disintegrate” to the party because the parties were asked to join the party.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to launch an investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
Elections in the midterm are only five weeks away from us, on November 6, and if Republicans behave badly as expected, it will lead to their fundamental weakening in attempts to impeach the man they demanded for a post at the supreme court.
George W. Bush telephoned senators, lobbied them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for President Bush in the White House, and through him he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens if the FBI compiles a report?
The Senate will vote and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which has allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the deal and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea 'received' after Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since the beginning of Kim Jong-un's rule seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers say.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 evacuations in the past year — compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park also said there were stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates required for smugglers at the borders.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements about this.
The vast majority of refugees from the North are now eligible for South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run across China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants, not as refugees, and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks aimed at halting denuclearization talks.
In addition, there was a historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive terms of cooperation in nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the United States of making no progress on the issue of sanctions.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves,” Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said she was unsuitable for the Supreme Court due to her temperament.
Hairy made this remark in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help myself, but if any woman ever performed such a theater, they’d call it ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh’s Thursday statement before the Senate Judiciary Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both still in puberty.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and whispering about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and said their allegations against him were "a large-scale and coordinated attack" by organised liberals who were unable to pass through Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s statement proved that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because he proved he was anti-democratic.
“I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he relied on Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi answered the question as to whether she would seek Kavanaugh’s appeal in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
“I’ll tell you this – if he doesn’t tell Congress the truth, then he’s not only eligible to work at the Supreme Court, but also the court he’s working on,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential income in court at the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade because she is considered a conservative judge.
As part of the hearings prior to his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided the answer to the question of whether he would reverse any Supreme Court decision.
“There’s no time for a hysterical, forensic person to go to court and expect us to just say, ‘Jeez, that’s beautiful,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
After months, months, and years of spelling, she couldn’t get rid of it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do I?”
She continues: “A woman who worked as a director somewhere helped me a lot, and she told me she was crying when she was angry too, but she developed some technique, which means that when she was angry and she started crying, she said to the person she was talking to because: “Maybe you think you’re sad, you think?
But I'm angry."
And so she went on.
And I think it's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of reaction to anger, in part because they are incomprehensible.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office dominated by men. Once there I expressed my inexpressible anger by crying. But the older, always cold-looking manager, who always crawled at me, crawled at me a bit, crawled.
“Never show them you’re crying,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they got you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential nomination.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was apprehended on board an unmarried affair Monkey Business and had to retreat from the struggle, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a smile after 30 years.
“Seven other candidates were nominated, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "The Snowman and the Seven Snakes."
Because at the time, the campaign had been running for a long time, she was unable to keep up with earning contributions, so she vowed not to go into the game unless she earned <0x24>2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give <0x24>1,000 to a male candidate would only give her <0x24>250.
“Do you think I’ll get a discount?” she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally carry out the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to earn money, and focusing on the voters rather than on the deputies, the deputies, and the pleas for sex.
“You might think I was nervous,” Mrs. Schroeder said of how the press reacted to her.
“And you might think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking what they might have written on my gravestone.
"Plakala"?
Why China-U.S. Trade War May Be Good for Beijing
The opening salvage of the trade war between the U.S. and China was embarrassing and although the battle is not far from being won, experts say the gap between the countries is in the long term beneficial to Beijing.
US President Donald Trump gave the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Most of the major escalations, however, saw the world’s light this week when new tariffs on goods were announced for <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which practically means taxing half of China’s trade exports to the United States.
Beijing has reacted every time, the most recent introduction of tariffs on five to ten percent of U.S. imports of 60 billion goods.
China has been trying to pay the U.S. with the same coin, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will fall to its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to return to its original tracks, it would mean resigning to its demands. But public submission to US demands would be absolutely humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Yet experts believe that if Beijing was able to play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The reality is that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic outburst in both countries. This is much more dangerous than observers have admitted so far,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow at the American Center for Security.
Syria is Ready to Return Refugees, Foreign Minister Says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than a seven-year war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's situation in the territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas of the destroyed terrorists to their normal state.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are met, as well as the unilateral economic measures that have been aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in building the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the insurgents.
Europe's response to the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Evria won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the edge of difficulty in France.
The U.S. has now lost sixth in a row on European soil, so it hasn’t won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then threw the ball into the water for 3 pairs of 16 holes and let go of the victory of Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari then lighted up in all his wheels and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best score 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest score, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World's highest-rated player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who apparently finished his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the overall best European player with 25.5 points earned during his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy that I won the cup back.
It all depends on the team, I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said after winning Europe.
He gave the cup to his countryman John Ramp, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
“I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, but I grew up following that guy,” Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games in France and now records a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 of the biggest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been racing all weekend in a bid to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed top golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's unsatisfactory results: "I'm proud of those guys, they really fought.
This morning we really warmed Europe to the heart.
We really couldn't handle it.
I'm wearing a hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and move forward in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could have made them captain.
I really need to squeeze.
You've lost us."
Red Stream Update: Concentrations are falling in the Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota districts
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to the overall decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, spots of blooming water are now reported from the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts – indicating decreasing concentrations.
The blooming red tide has a range of about 130 miles of coast from the northern Pinellas District to the southern Lee District.
