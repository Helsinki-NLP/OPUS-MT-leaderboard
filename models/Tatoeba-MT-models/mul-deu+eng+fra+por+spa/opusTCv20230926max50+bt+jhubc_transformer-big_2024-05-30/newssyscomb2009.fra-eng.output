Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria resulted in a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current major coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the Union’s electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), Governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remain, with 29.8 percent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the votes.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP, which with 25.6 percent lost nearly nine percent of the votes, ended up even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Already in early July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advance on the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
But voters were visibly punishing them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations were made about the possible resignation of party leader and current deputy chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, during the special council of the party’s leadership.
Such a development would a priori facilitate the path to the outcome of the election that remains most likely, namely the renewal of the major SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
However, given the reinforcement of the two right-wing populist parties - the free parties (FP<0xC3><0x96>) would have obtained 18 percent and BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven percent of the votes - the socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repetition in 1999, when the common popular party agreed with the populists, which at the time was still a part of the European P<0xC3><0x96>.
Haider, who had already stated that he was ready to cooperate with any party and that he was planning to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently put on this development.
The last party to have access to parliament is the Greens, but they have slightly lost and resumed, among the Austrian political parties, from the third to the fifth position.
Obviously, no other party has crossed the 4% threshold and has no access to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India are likely to cool
If we could not solve the problem of Czech researchers accused in India of illegal picking of cabbage, there would be, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem wasn't resolved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he said after the meeting, which took place following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, out of the talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
He noted, however, that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the local government.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Hence, he could ask for bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same way during the talks.
"It advises to appeal to a higher court, after which it could be graced," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
"We want above all to maintain the best relationship with India, which has a tradition that has continued over many years.
The Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic accorded great importance to the problem of Czech entomology.
“We consider the incarceration and accusations of these Czech researchers to be a great contempt,” he said.
The Minister avoided the question of whether he had obtained the promise from India to take care of the matter.
"I've already received quite a number of promises," he notes only.
A Czech arbiter fight for the seabed
It is approaching an electronic wall map, on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are represented.
But he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
This area is as large as the continent itself,” says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of the UN Ocean and Sea Law Division.
The head of the division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
Burning at work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world little known so far, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms currently unknown, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A deeper depth than the solid earth
Nowadays, the coastal states have begun to aspire vehemently to the new submarine territories.
According to a UN convention, they exercise their rights, which they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
The latter may, according to the convention, exclusively claim all resources of the continental shelf.
To simplify, the part of the seabed and its underground, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered as a continental shelf.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yon,” explains Mikulka.
The request that the country concerned submit to the Commission for the Establishment of the External Borders of the Continental Shelf must be supported by a broad scientific and technical documentation, based on many costly prospects and metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
To date, the Commission has dealt with five requests, those of Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful,” Mikulka added.
The success of Australia, which is the first to have significantly expanded its submarine possessions, has recently experienced a global resurgence.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which the Commission assigned to it last week, amounts to 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospects.
The profit they will make in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they plan, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their request.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, declared by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no longer any state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"However, we are not mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Mikulka, exaggerating that "their areas are clearly defined and their regime is anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former bloc of L'Est countries as part of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It obtained in 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of what is called a "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is moved there, it is a kind of submarine replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract it on an expanse with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a landfill rich in polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” lists Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such concreteness.
She recalls a little potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on the scene for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested Germany’s help in solving the hostage crisis – experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they never took action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are revealed.
According to the instructions of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Thus, both federal army specialists as well as GSG 9 officials, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technische Hilfewerk were on the spot of release.
As the ministry spokesman said on Monday evening, the German forces were ultimately not required, hostage takers having released their prisoners and fleeing when they recognized the imminence of a force-freeze.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on the ground as a support force.
"It has fortunately not happened so far," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers had abducted in southern Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has remained vague so far, as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been rescued have arrived in the meantime healthy and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not say anything about the details of the release.
At the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to Bild magazine, the five vacationers and special forces were expected to take off on board an Airbus from the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress recently failed the <0x24>700 billion heavy financial market rescue plan.
The Dow Jones crashed into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s financial markets rescue plan.
Despite all the appeals made by US President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was supposed to haunt the chaos of financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, supporters had desperately tried to convince opponents of this <0x24>700 billion hefty plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, called on MPs to vote in favour although the plan is unpopular.
“It’s hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the investor’s concern that the state bailout plan could overwhelm.
It returned shortly before the end of the vote, then, after the announcement of the failure, to fall again.
Experts are now projecting new serious turbulence on international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, approval and approval from the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are required.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months according to a study, the turnover significantly increased compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite the low conjoncture prospects, Germans’ travel thirst remains insatiable, according to this study.
As for bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing booking figures already dominate the autumn months.
Thus, the sales figure would have risen to about 11 percent more than in 2007, the DRV said.
The sources of these results are the figures from the GfK, which analyzes monthly booking data from 1,200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low price of the dollar, trips to the US would be particularly demanding, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would be about a third.
Alongside this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be particularly sought after destinations by the Germans.
Particularly organized trips are very demanding, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising energy and food prices, the costs would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with discounts on early bookings or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been highly retained so that an increase in sales figures will be recorded again compared to last year – although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
The hits of Ballermann or After-Ski continuously, from beer in liter stamps and celebrities in Tyrolean designer costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don’t have much in common.
She is blonde, an animator of television and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to reach its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the equator of the Weißwurst, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on Thérèse Square, everything is half less bad.
Everyone or almost wears a Tyrolean costume or leather pants; no one looks blasted or embarrassed - this is completely normal.
Only the board of my Tyrolean costume collects a few odd-looking shots at the banana-choco stand.
A Bavarian woman told me that I would have badly attached my tabletop: "Left means free, middle virgin, right broken, back widow."
Discreetly, I triple my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she said and laughed.
Others don't feel as bad for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple filters, on which it's written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us their nude back-train without being invited.
The young man with an exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time at the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "ooooo" all over it.
He's telling me all this after he's relieved of the scoop he'd drank before.
Right next to this mouth of fire that everyone thinks is garbage.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild peasants."
Others don’t have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, ribs of rescuers run on the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in the moat - always by four, they drag their covered civics from tents to tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we come back full of it.
Those who rest in the box of the drunkards under the shell are not visible.
"These are the ones who can no longer swallow anything," one of the rescuers yelled at me in response to my question and then disappeared into the mix.
Accident victim identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon crash in town on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has been released since, under bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey was planning to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps away from Asia, is one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-Renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its corners, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vooted ticket office, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, late in the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad, as well as the land known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and empire forces further advanced Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it is a sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to underline the enlargement of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new policy of commitments.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a bed wagon towards the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish AKP MP Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour journey, shaking on noisy rails whose cadence reminiscent of the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I was finally arriving in the Turkish capital—presented as a new city of a new century-old state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, is an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspects the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built in stone and steel, in a developing area, surrounded by half-built shopping centers and many pastries in which middle managers in costume-cravate- business are men's and women's-women's business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"The purpose of this foreign policy is to now reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey was cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for one and the other.
She had to do both.
“But, at some point, ‘I asked if’ Turkey should not choose?”
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost all of those with whom I have been able to speak to have told me heartily: The Turkish railroad not only goes to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, it is therefore as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as it is for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another night without sleep, I thought about these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could be largely in Turkey's hands.
While waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I recalled the period during which Turkey had been named "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Music Director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic young choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include those under the age of 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over the age of 20 refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the choir's willingness and ability to handle any type of music presented to him, be it madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, still exciting, thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how often Tod told us to “let music speak for itself.”
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything is there, in the music.
So sing!"
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, though never dictatorial or apparent.
Whatever the musical standard, it was much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades of 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me—and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley so rarely held this combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, “focused only on certain people.”
He'll miss a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (died September 25) states that "in 1946, he had resumed his studies in economic history, at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, MA and PhD."
This is what comes from a letter from the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British Plastic Industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with a lot of respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second strike for Honda’s super sales
In November, Honda will launch the second-generation Jazz.
If its predecessor already had good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
Added to this are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz features a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them are an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before reviewing the new model, it should be noted that the new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation was launched.
First of all, it is noted that Honda has renovated this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more than one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz in 2007, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, representing a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
Officials of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely offset the drop in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers hope to end the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% decrease in sales.
With this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to gain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size – 4.37 meters long – on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change at 1.52 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and the interior space as well.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the capacity of the box – which has a dual bottom system – can contain up to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity than the first-generation box.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation – in addition to external elements such as rear lights or the panoramic roof – is the improvement of access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, partly relative to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened at an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2- and 1.4-liter petrol engines.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This propeller - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propeller, which in the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This 100 horse Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The ‘bee car’ that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by the nature, especially of bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers from Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have made this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Center of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan safety shield.
This robot will allow brand vehicles to prevent collisions.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But most importantly, the bee's eyes are composed, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
In order to recreate this visual function, engineers developed what is called a laser range finder.
This detects obstacles that are at a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor immediately to avoid the obstacle.
“At the moment he detects an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurcating its wheels by 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Movement Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned upwards or downwards, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotational function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
Every second this device must only process information and act according to that data.
It doesn’t need to keep the information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with just a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This is the first because of the development of new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced in serial cars in a decade, according to Nissan.
The robot runs with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a satellite navigation GPS system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding road obstacles.
They are afraid to be hypothesized.
It must be acknowledged that the Treasury of the United States, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make plans, is not lacking in geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That's to say, "The Hotel of Bad Credits"... or stories.
The ugly aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Master leads us to think several times if this is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is certain that this game provides useful but little detailed information.
It's more a game reserved for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
A dream room appears in the interior of the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry at its table of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s first bank, which will pay <0x24>9 billion to take up 21% of its capital, a new one welcomed by a sharp drop in its stock price.
A week after unveiling a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s regular shares at a unit price of <0x24>25.25, or a total of <0x24>3 billion.
The retained price is 19% lower than the accounting value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional <0x24>6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of <0x24>31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of <0x24>29, which is 28% above its current price.
Morgan Stanley's stock, however, lost 6.79% to <0x24>23.07 at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said John Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but pass it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has been changed over the last few days: on Monday, Morgan simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about <0x24>8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, told Tokyo, “we thought that participation would be entirely composed of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares within one year if they trade more than 50% above the conversion price, or about <0x24>47, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, a spokeswoman for the group declined to provide clarification on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to show a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the industry’s best.
Morgan said he had “neutrally” eased his balance sheet since late August.
The past few weeks have been challenging for the group, which saw its stock exchange rate melt by half as the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt floated.
This cost fell on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of major Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised <0x24>15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warrenf group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refounding the Republic around 21st Century Socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it was the third to put a new draft constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results accounting for 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" got 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polling stations and a countdown from a non-governmental organization announced a wide victory of the "yes" between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa claimed the victory of his draft constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
“The Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way,” he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at Guayaquil Governorate headquarters, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales as well as his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place quietly according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), covered a 444-point text consolidating the “new socialism” defended by the president.
The draft Constitution consecrates the power of the State on the economy, reserving it with the "development planning" of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the Head of State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will hold a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further strengthens the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts, who had been held captive for ten days in the desert, were brought back this Monday afternoon healthy and safe to the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at about 3:30 p.m. on board a special plane at al-Maza military base, which was taken up at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo examinations there.
They are "healthy" and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the spot.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this hostage group had been voted out of hiding by 35 unknown hijackers.
It includes 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the Egyptian agency, the organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, taken on board two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
“There was an exchange of shots, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing,” said the official who demanded anonymity.
He said 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "clair" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
Italian diplomat Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men of the secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the eve, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a 4x4 vehicle on board of which the kidnappers were, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-United Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture takes place and occupies the current election campaign.
So much better.
But an area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the amounts of misery that are allocated to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or nationally starving historical sites?
Which politician would dare to remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected people, and all government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers grouped into 211 companies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with monitoring history, preserving with three of the private archives and preserving archives.
They are often the guard dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When, a tribune for history and heritage?
Benelux Governments Nationalize Part of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank as the first European banking institution in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries also support, with a sum of interest of 11.2 billion and this financial institution of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 billion.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed at the highest level on this matter, also calling on the European Central Bank and the Competition Officer of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been intensifying for more than a year, is for the bank Fortis. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will redeem nearly half (49%) of the bank’s capital located in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell some of its shares, including, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, that it acquired last year from the Dutch agency ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis stocks began a dizzying fall, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let go of bankruptcy.
Only on Friday, the company’s shares fell 12 percent, reaching its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group’s capital turns around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion, which, according to the company’s leaders, is not realistic.
The company’s management accuses the uncertainty of the outer Atlantic, in relation to the adoption of the US <0x24>700 billion bailout plan, of being the cause of the drop in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial body was also looking for private contractors, but has not yet received a proposal on the fund.
Earlier, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank’s customer circle and no agency was assaulted.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also redeemed leasing companies.
A dwarf in the chick
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of prescription information, in any case, to the agreement of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's all about entrusting its chicken to a dwarf," Richard Dicket, the program's creator used to manage prescription drugs, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the insured capital in case of damage, on the health status of the client who is present, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not even insur it.
In the past, they sent the candidates to a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after learning of the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, it is easily provided to pharmacies, data on the person's purchases of medicines in the last eighteen months. From that, the program determines that the person's health is itself, and that the person's health is ill.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is no longer much to do to the insurer other than paperwork. However, small problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraines or heat bumps, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others do not.
Companies have evolved in research and data analysis, and they need to ask the patient for permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced by the authorities, even if they have not been sanctioned for their failures in the past.
Recently, some companies have also processed the results of laboratory tests, and linked them to data on drug consumption, thus enabling them to provide an even more accurate portrait of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and controlling usage is becoming increasingly difficult in parallel.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill on the extension of the authority control circle for data-suppliing companies is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent, since if he or she refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
Thus, and ultimately, chickens depend on the kindness of the rabbit.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trade partners for each other, this issue also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other, largely global issues.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit, which will be mainly about cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a large emerging democratic power to which a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet reached an agreement on their support in New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
In addition, they did not focus too much on this issue yesterday at the 9th summit in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the head of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in the course of five years, they would be one hundred thousand and one hundred thousand.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious goal.
In this respect, they have legally harmonised the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civil flights, so that air trade can also grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up negotiations.
The objective is to balance the situation with, on the one hand, India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and, on the other hand, New Delhi, which is only in ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a UN conference on this issue has been mentioned.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been requested, although both have a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains loyal to the energy and climate programme, in particular, that it would like to reduce its emissions of toxic substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the fact that a global market would need to pass at the climate conference scheduled for next year, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent by 2050.
They also wished to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The head of state of India is heading to the French capital today, where, during a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the deal would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers attend the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits this edition, with more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 101 different countries occupying the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles on display, and Turkey as a guest of honor.
It will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Wealth and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, during the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: in fact, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of space.
It will be followed by an appointment with the press in the Room Structur, at the 5.0 butterfly of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books is gradually decreasing from the total of Italian production, and in particular from that of adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada Desert, was found.
The debris was found on a 3,000-metre-altitude plateau in the Mammonth Lakes Sierra Nevada area on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, eased the doubts that remained: “The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that this is the one Steve Fosset was travelling on the day he disappeared,” he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was deemed dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) said that a few hours after the debris was detected, a team of investigators sent to the site identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fossett de Nedala took a flight from Neva.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a pull.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an air balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had toured the world by plane and without escalation.
Among all these records, also the one that flew at a height of 15,445 meters, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you don't expect.
A 4x4 out of the ordinary with an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and clean angles.
This is, in summary, Glk, the latest born off-road "compacts" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new wind in this sector.
Just by its off-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising batting that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan’s shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimension and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, we will have the impression that by looking at the picture, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed in raising the interest of future acquisitions with this formula? We will see well.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italy" which has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created big problems.
He had never faced adversarial fans.
The group's extraction is on the right.
Promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not really) from Campania and the Pigs were added.
They had tricolored flags on which their home town appeared: Saturday night, they were all kidnapped to not be identified.
They are inspired by the English fan series.
In Bulgaria, they found a fan-series of real Nazis, the Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And they had all been checked by the Viminal: among those who went to Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, no one had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans who had a history of stage crime, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it may be that fans arrested or identified in the disorders purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits attending Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer stand in the stadium.
I'm glad.
But now is the time of the fear-emulation: that is to say that others risk adding to the first hundred and fifty.
“We must immediately extinguish this fire, and not legitimize who behaves like this,” the Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes open especially for Wednesday's national team match at Lecce"
In the Poultry there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory will meet on Tuesday the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aise, i.e. the secret services, which deal with the problems of the stage.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the post of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly prefect in Trieste where he resides a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds Observatory No. 1 - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the incident occurs.
So far, this group had remained in the rules, now we'll see what happened, and we'll evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about whispers to Mameli’s hymn: those too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polite.
