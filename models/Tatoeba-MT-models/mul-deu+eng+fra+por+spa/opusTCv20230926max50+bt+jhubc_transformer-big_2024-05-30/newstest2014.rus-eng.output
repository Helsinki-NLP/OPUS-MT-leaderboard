Two men killed by suicide in Kineshma and neighbourhood
Earlier, one of the suspects had attempted suicide.
On October 30, about 1-00, in the village of Lugovoe where he was born, a man of 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had attempted suicide before.
What pushed the man to such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, at the place of residence killed a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma.
No signs of violent death have been detected, according to the press service of the Ministry of the Interior "Kineshemsky".
Do you have a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money to repair a depleted highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box that is neatly fitted to your car’s accessory panel.
These devices, tracking every mile a motorist travels and transmitting this information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial attempt to modernize America’s outdated motorway financing system undertaken by Washington and the state’s planning authorities.
The usually boring motorway planning arena suddenly generated intense debates and colorful alliances.
The Libertarians joined the environmental groups in the lobbying of granting the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you travel and even possibly where you travel them – and then use that information when making tax bills.
The movement of tea in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions regarding privacy.
And while Congress cannot yet agree, continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They are thinking about how over the next decade we can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have the satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not the question we may have the right to choose,” Hasan Ihrat, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which is preparing plans to begin tracking the miles each California driver drives by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
Technology already exists for this.
The need for this is exacerbated by the lack of funds from the Government’s Road Construction Fund, financed by taxes that Americans pay on car fuels.
Americans don’t buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars travel more than a gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax by even one cent at high prices for gasoline.
“The gasoline tax is simply impossible to save,” said Lee Mannich, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on the cars to test the error-payment system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long run,” he said.
Borrowers call this a misguided user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as with the help of taxes it will be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce road loads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planning bodies in California are looking at this system as they develop strategies to achieve the targets set by the state's ambitious global warming laws.
Member of the House of Representatives Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also viewed the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market enthusiasts at Reason Fund are also thrilled that they will force drivers to pay for each mile.
“It’s not just a tax that will go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Reason’s Vice President for Political Affairs.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called for Congress to move in the direction of wrong pay.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a <0x24>90 million pilot project involving around 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of concerns from rural legislators representing voters who often have to travel many miles in everyday life to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, are taking this route on their own.
The biggest enthusiasm is expressed in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state for mileage instead of a gasoline tax.
The pilot project in Nevada has been completed.
In New York, it is being considered.
Illinois will try it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 East Coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can implement these changes.
This concept has not received universal recognition.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track each step.
“Concerns about Big Brother and things like that are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and efficiency management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn’t what people wanted.
As the tests went on, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to keep records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of the few states where it is difficult to search for inexpensive technology that would allow the state authorities to account for car miles, but without information about location and time.
If you can do this, Han said, society will feel more relaxed.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small, young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not contribute to the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the emerging market of car insurance, in which drivers pay on the basis of the run.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically loaded using a modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t track their speed and track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been several major mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are a lot less expensive and less coercive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with providing drivers with different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device, instead deciding to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state travel.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea to a cautious public, forcing devices to do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials seek to develop a taxable device that will also accept payments on parking counters, provide “pay as you drive” insurance and collect a pool of data on speed to be taken out in real time from other drivers who would drive the car.
“Automobilists will be attracted to the participation of the benefits that they will offer,” — says the document of urban design.
Some transport system designers, however, are wondering if all the talk about mispayment is just a huge distraction.
In the San Francisco Bay City Transport Commission, officials say the Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Trusted Road Construction Fund by raising gasoline taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be charged to hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to pay their fair share.
“There’s no need for radical surgical intervention when all you have to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentsler, director of the Legislative and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in the event of Russian economic pressure
The European Union has a backup plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
The IMF is negotiating a stand-by loan, and another EU official, who is directly involved in the negotiations, added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements on financing terms.
He does not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to get help, and the international rating agency S&P, which on Friday lowered the sovereign rating of Ukraine by one degree - to "B-" from "B".
However, EU representatives say that the IMF can show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country’s financial support plan, the EU has a backup option to provide Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which supplies are now coming from Russia.
It may be gas from the North Stream or vice versa from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in case Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that such a method of reversible supplies to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and will likely lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
"Negotiations are being held between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favourable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," Reuters said.
Russia out of the fight for the pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of major cities have been observed in most megacities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about their restructuring and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for car trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
An example of Singapore is widely known, where a strict quota of the increase in the number of private cars is introduced, and the right to purchase them is purchased at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry into the city centre.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green areas are introduced, where only vehicles with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter, which also use high-quality fuel (including biofuel or electric vehicles).
Beijing's Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a "five-year clean air plan" worth about 250 billion yuan (about <0x24>40 billion) in 2012.
As the Director of Transport Pollution Control Department of the Municipal Environmental Protection Office of Beijing Li Kunsheng said, the main goal of the five-year - the reduction of the leading pollutants of the air by 20-35% of the use of air by 2017, the increase in the number of private cars up to the level of 5
According to the agency, the car transport in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5% of the total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme is the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the urban measures of the "green five-year-old") include the accelerated transition to the Eurostandards of fuel, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and the labelling of vehicles and fuel, the restriction on the entry of vehicles in the central part of the city, the prohibition on the use of fuel.
The number of automotive innovations in Beijing also includes the prohibition of travel for all private cars within the fifth transport ring (all in the capital of China six of them) one day a week (the corresponding information is contained in the registration of the vehicle, the registration of the vehicle, the registration of the vehicle), and the issuance of the registration of the cars.
According to the current state Environmental Protection Programme 2012-2020, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution is expected to fall to 128 (138) in 2012.
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011, "mobile sources" accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial ones, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In the Russian Federation, for now, only start to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of the cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Transportation Economics and Transport Policy of the University of Stockholm, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for car trips are unpopular, they can only be adopted by society if their full universality.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem associated with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of poorly sensitive to any regulatory effects - office and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the number of which is not less than 200.
During the days, urbanists from the ECOM Centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study, analyzing the balance of urban areas between the residential building, the road surface area and the number of road transport.
The main conclusions of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads twice as much as required, and most drivers living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking spaces or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parking spaces, but car warehouses, not to expand, but to reduce the passage (to make the streets more pedestrian-friendly), as well as to limit the use and placement of private transport in the territory of the city of the protected zone of the historic center of the city.
Penalties for unauthorized street trafficking in Vologda will increase by one time
According to the city authorities, the increase in the amount of fines will help to set order in Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the products they sell are often not undergoing adequate sanitary checks.
This means that the health of the wetlands is at risk.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, the press service of the Vologda Administration reports.
Goldman Sachs warns of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of rising risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia – consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of unpaid consumer loans and a massive reduction in the number of employees.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of this growth.
Recently, it has been completely influenced by consumption, which almost does not ease turnover,” Goldman Sachs chief economist for Russia Clemens Grafe said, presenting a quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Currently, the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
With 6% inflation, it will be able to provide future consumer demand around the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is declining, so they are likely to optimize the cost of personnel.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages increase by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, - Mr Grafe explained.
The companies faced a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to dismissals and an increase in unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise wages, comments the chief economist of Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment near historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
In order to trick employees from the side or keep the current one, employers have to raise salaries.
Consumption in Russia supports a very rapid growth in consumer credit.
In the view of Mr. Grafe, due to the extremely high rates of consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplicative effect on the economy of the country.
“We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of consumer loans, money is not spent on the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments,” the economist said.
But the problem in the other is that Goldman Sachs expects an increase in overdue loans.
They are mostly taken by poor people who have nothing to provide for.
The interest rates on such loans are high.
As a result, they are not returned more often,” Mr. Grafe noted.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible crisis of unpaid loans.
The director of the Banking Institute Vasily Soldokov already sees signs of an aging banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, having no access to the cheap resources that state banks have, have been forced to attract the funds of the population at high interest rates.
In response, the state banks went on the path of war and began to lower credit rates, the economist continues.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks do not give up dumping, Russia will face a full-fledged banking crisis, says Vasily Soldokov.
The deprivation of licenses by a number of banks in recent weeks has been seen by the economist as a forerunner of a mass collapse.
“State banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was initially not designed for a systemic crisis,” the head of the institute warns.
But the growth of consumption will slow and without the crisis of non-payments, the investment bank believes, - due to the refusal to index the wages of civil servants and military, as set out in the current version of the draft budget.
The impact on consumption will partially be mitigated by the freezing of natural monopoly tariffs (and, as a result, a decrease in inflation).
But only partially: if investments do not grow (and the prerequisites for this are not yet - see the report), consumption growth will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is confident.
Vladimir Pantushin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen the prerequisites for the realization of pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is still a drop in oil prices,” he says.
According to his estimates, Russia’s economy will begin to decline at a price of oil below <0x24>90/barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is not yet in a position to lower interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has fallen, and banks have begun to raise rates.
This could mean that they didn’t believe the CB that announced the transition to targeting inflation,” said Clemens Grafe.
The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, it only affects interbank lending rates.
"For the CB, it is the collapse of all hopes," said Clemens Grafe.
The money received at the auctions of the ECB is used by banks not to lend the economy, but to manage its liquidity.
As soon as the rate drops, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go on speculation against the ruble.
“Sooner or later the ECB will realize that this strategy does not work,” Grafe said, reminding that the state plans to release the ruble into “free shipping” by the end of 2015.
But it will either have to do it earlier, or raise the key rate of the CB (5.5%), he believes.
According to his estimate, the price of the ruble is now artificially exceeded by 10%.
The ruble has only one way to lose weight, the expert concludes.
But if the central bank plunges into the finances at least a shadow of doubt that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy of weakening the ruble, it can crush the ruble much more strongly.
In Chelyabinsk, the second congress of the peoples of the Southern Urals took place.
The forum is dedicated to the Day of People’s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of the Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and areas of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening international consensus.
We can set an example here not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We don’t have differences and differences.
We live in full mutual understanding,” says Teofan, metropolitan Chelyabinsky and Zlatoustovsky.
During the meeting, a number of issues were discussed, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
As a result, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
Here the exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region opened.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. intelligence
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence investigator, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Kit Alexander, were unable to answer questions about their activities.
German deputy Hans-Christian Ströbel met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, who presented the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “While the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat divergence as a form of treason and seeks to criminalize political statements that are not criminalized by criminals.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to waive criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have become tense after allegations that the NSA listened to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who heads the parliamentary group that runs the intelligence service, said that if there is an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, “not putting him at risk and not destroying relations with the United States completely,” it should be used.
Mr. Str<0xC3><0xB8>bel, a member of parliament from the Green Party of Germany, posted his photo with Mr. Snowden on Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Str<0xC3><0xB8>bele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be “safe” there, the deputy said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a “hard and persistent” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was inspired by the world’s response to his “political statements.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials — including in the United States — considered the disclosure of an uncontrollable system of pervasive surveillance useful to society.
The letter proposes to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.”
Frontier Airlines will charge a fee for manual deposits
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to <0x24>100 for carrying a handbag on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to <0x24>100 for handheld and <0x24>2 for coffee or gas, although their announcement on Wednesday said passengers would be able to keep the entire bank.
The new handheld fee applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge <0x24>25 if the fee is paid in advance, and <0x24>100 if travelers will only pay after landing.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the <0x24>100 fee should make passengers pay in advance.
“We don’t want to charge for that,” she said.
The airline began charging a fee for the first and second baggage delivered in 2008.
Passengers who try to avoid these fees are dragging as much as they can into the handbag box placed in the upper luggage compartments, which is why there is often a lack of space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to get passengers to spend less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection wasn't really about making money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier customers say that finding a place in the upper luggage compartments is becoming more and more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in a row at the time of departure for the Frontier flight may be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in a row may pay <0x24>100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said the changes to the procedures on the website and at the Frontier registration stands were intended to ensure that passengers would know about the collection before they reached the landing exit.
The new Frontier manual deposit collection will not begin to be collected until summer, although the date has not yet been established.
Passengers often complain about the fee for baggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of baggage costs money, and passengers who need this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of luggage fees a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover airfare costs after several years of losses.
However, most of them were not related to handheld fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first handheld fee three years ago, and another Allegiant Air discounter later followed its example.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks the additional fees.
According to his estimates in the December 2011 report, the handheld fee brings Spirit <0x24>50 million a year.
Sorensen, the former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew on a Spirit flight, and he was curious to find out when he lands when passengers encounter an unusual Spirit fee for a handbag.
“The landing process was the smoothest of what I’ve seen in my airline career,” he said.
I was expecting to see a tooth crossing and the emergence of a fight at the landing.
The plane was full, he said, “and the landing was fast.”
Frontier also follows Spirit for a <0x24>2 fee for coffee, tea, gaseous or juice.
Frontier said passengers who get gas or juice can keep the whole bank and that a coffee stream will be provided free of charge.
It will still be able to distribute water for free.
US Airways tried to charge a drink fee for a short time in 2008, but refused it seven months later, after passengers started complaining and no other major airline followed its example.
The Frontier initiative to collect a fee for the manual deposit, when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last step in attracting customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket vendors, such as Orbitz, from <0x24>10 to <0x24>25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than to contact an online travel agency.
The frontier, however, went beyond everyone in this area.
In September, she began giving twice as few bonus miles as a frequent flying passenger to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the premium mileage to 25 percent of the mileage.
For example, a 1000-mile trip with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would allow you to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming lossy.
Revenue declined by 9 percent, and flight opportunities declined by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to fix the Frontier finances as part of the airline’s sale.
The NSA blames “internal error” and not hackers for discontinuing the site
The covert National Security Agency said on Friday evening that the discontinuation of their site for several hours caused a technical failure, not hackers, as the network claimed.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the planned update,” the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The statements that the interruption was caused by a distributed “service denial” (DDoS) attack are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems recorded that the NSA site had not been working for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an agency spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal secret network was “not at all” hacked.
No classified information is in jeopardy, the spokesman said.
At least one online group of hackers-activists said it was responsible for the removal of the NSA’s website through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to squeeze the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is out of operation.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Earlier, the supersecret NSA, once nicknamed "Not such an agency", was in the center of public attention and fierce criticism in recent months after a series of revelations about its extensive programs, the work of the NSA's overseas and inside the country.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has sparked the impression that today’s incident was the result of targeted hackers’ actions.
Bombardier’s profit decreases with drops in supplies and the number of aircraft orders
Bombardier, a Canadian manufacturer of aircraft and trains, reported on Thursday a 15 percent net profit reduction due to the decrease in the number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway division.
The Montreal-based company Bombardier has also not released any data on the flight tests of its latest CSeries aircraft and has not provided any new information on whether the ambitious plans to launch the aircraft into commercial operation will be met by next year.
After the first flight of the experimental model of the aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it only flew three more times, which raises questions about whether the test stage is on schedule.
The results did not justify forecasts and led to a decline in stocks of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating from “average” to “average” on Thursday because of the belief that stock growth is limited to the next quarter or two.
“While the decline in the number of aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed by the transport department’s profits,” Doerksen said in a stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will be more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to occupy a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus now dominate.
The first experimental sample of the aircraft was presented in March and made the first flight in September after a few months of delay.
However, firm orders for the CSeries are not too much yet – 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to check the company’s approvals on fuel efficiency and potential cost-effectiveness of the new liner.
There are currently 403 orders and arrangements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boduan was confident that Bombardier would reach its target in 300 solid orders by the time the first aircraft is launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving forward as planned.
“The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Boduan said during a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned for the time the plane stopped.
All manufacturers plan the tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is expected to fly in the coming weeks and all others will be followed soon, the company said.
Analysts are skeptical of the announcement that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it is evaluating the deadline for commissioning and will provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – albeit apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that the launch will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net income fell to <0x24>147 million, or 8 cents per share, from <0x24>172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted profit per share remained the same – 9 cents.
Gross income decreased slightly — from <0x24>4.2 to <0x24>4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a 10-cent profit per share and a <0x24>4.56 billion gross income, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, which is less than the previous year's 57.
The total number of orders dropped from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The order portfolio of the aerospace department was <0x24>32.9 billion on September 30, unchanged since December 31.
“In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our goals, but the small number of orders received and the overall market conditions have become an unpleasant factor,” said Boduan.
Gross aviation revenues fell by 13 percent – to <0x24>2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said gross revenue in the sector grew by almost 11 percent to <0x24>2.1 billion.
The order portfolio in the transport division was <0x24>32.6 billion on September 30, slightly higher than the 31 December figure.
The revenues of the transport unit were negatively affected by the problems with the execution of several major contracts.
The management said that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced that Google’s chief financial officer Patrick Pickett would join the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to C<0x24>4.83 on auctions in mid-Thursday.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor to Bombardier, said on Thursday that its quarterly revenue was down by 10 percent.
Sony expects to make a lower annual profit.
Japanese electronics manufacturer Sony, after completing the past quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or <0x24>197 million, cut the forecast for the current fiscal year.
Sony's results from July to September 2013 were more shocking than expected due to the decline in demand for TVs, video cameras and personal computers manufactured by the Japanese corporation.
Sony’s television business, which brought the company’s first three-year operating profit of 5.2 billion yen, again fell to 9.3 billion yen of operating losses in the reporting period.
Japan’s consumer electronics market is experiencing tough times, especially due to the decline in demand for televisions.
And while competitors are looking for a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main competitors, Panasonic, has recently shifted its focus on industrial components: this is where the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the financial year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts predicted that the figure would be significantly higher and would be 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In the middle of this month, it was announced the start of sales of "smart" watches from the Japanese corporation, equipped with a number of fashionable features that will allow you to get rid of the need to get a smartphone 100 times a day from your pocket.
After Sony lowered its annual profit and revenue forecast, the company's shares on the opening of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost more than 11%, falling to the level of 1668 yen per share.
The gene of speech proved to be a stimulant for the formation of synapses
Scientists from John Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein through which the “speech gene” Foxp2 performs its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, on the website of the magazine you can read its brief content.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who were unable to say words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
Scientists found that members of the family had been disrupted by the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function remains unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of its functions Foxp2 performs as a stimulant for the formation of new synapses in the brain related to speech formation.
It does this thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, with only Foxp2 being used for its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocalization has been confirmed by scientists in a mouse experiment.
When the gene activity in animals was artificially reduced, they shouted less when separated from the mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of the sounds being released was also restored.
Previously, the mouse was also shown a link to the vocalization of Foxp2.
Animals who introduced a human copy of the gene ate more actively and at a lower frequency than ordinary mice.
To date, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and SRPX2, respectively, is related to purely “mechanical” sound-forming properties or more subtle processes.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the head of a criminal group about a police investigation is imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta handed information to criminal authority Neil Scarborough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be uncovered.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer, who told the drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid of revealing his secret drug addiction, was imprisoned for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta handed over to the criminal authority Nilu Scarborough secret information about his investigation into illegal drug trafficking after he was threatened by his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed Bash and named among the criminals as a "hard lawyer", was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to track down Scarborough, which he previously represented in a drug-related court.
Officers noted Scarborough, 32, left three packets of cocaine at a lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a lawyer's association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta was “regularly using” class A drugs after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on his credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information on the arrests of two persons on the orders of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were currently under police supervision as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization selling heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Mersisade, Berkeshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after police seized <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million in heroin and cocaine raids and more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash.
42-year-old Ditta passed on information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be revealed.
Today, in Liverpool’s Royal Court, Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors Law Firm in Blackburn, was embarrassed after admitting his guilt in two cases of deliberate obstruction to the administration of justice following a three-week trial in Leipzig.
He admitted to storing cocaine at one of the previous trials.
The lawyer's disclosure came after police investigating Scarborough's activities found out that he had spoken regularly with Ditta on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and found him approaching Ditt's house in Blackburn and placed drugs of 60 percent purity in a black golf glove under a lawyer's garbage bin.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough repeatedly called Ditta, who was at dinner at the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations were held between them.
The court found out that Ditta was “regularly using” cocaine after tests found traces of class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, said he had spoken to a suspected dealer as he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a "law secret".
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and a hair sample was also taken.
In an interrogation at the police, he said that in addition to his workplace, he also had a home office, and clients came home to him on legal matters.
However, it became known to the court that after important arrests, he called the largest drug traffickers, a number of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell what the detectives knew about them.
In her prosecution speech, Anne White said, “If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, it’s a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has entered into too close relationships with certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his talks will certainly prove legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the usual relationship between a lawyer and a client.
He has prevented the police investigation as much as possible in order to allow these persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not respect his profession, but shamed it.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and allowed him to doubt his uninterest.
“If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and wanted to pass the information on to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately.”
But after the meeting, senior officer Lee Holstead of Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta turned from a criminal lawyer to a criminal as soon as he started buying drugs from representatives of organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the targets of the main members of the criminal groups who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and instill trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to cover up his profession.
The investigation into Mr. Ditta's case led Lancashire's specially dangerous organised crime unit, which had already been convicted of three cases of cocaine storage, and now also of obstructing the administration of justice, demonstrating our desire to prosecute.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years after admitting his guilt in a conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers, in which he says that the job of his dream is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the perfect companion for him at dinner – Mohammed Ali, and motivation at work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready for the reception of 22,000 spectators, said police officers, who were present today at the meeting of the KDC of the Russian Federation.
The ticketing program is, in their opinion, about twice as high.
During the 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia with Spartacus, only a thousand drivers were involved at the regulatory rate of nine thousand.
Spartakov fans had 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the stadium’s capacity, however, according to the agreement with the Moscow club, 5,000 tickets were sold to them.
This data was announced by the head of the KDC, Arthur Grigoryantz.
The Americans listened to Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, one of the U.S. intelligence officials, who preferred not to disclose his name, said the U.S. had listened to phone calls from senior Japanese officials.
This person confirmed that in the country of the rising sun there are several points intended for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand are not conducting intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this was the case during World War II, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are targets for intelligence activities, NHK reported.
Officially, none of the parties has yet commented on this information.
Let’s remind, news of the U.S. intelligence service’s surveillance of the Federal Chancellor appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA could have listened to Merkel’s phone for the past ten years.
The Chancellor herself, according to some data, received the news of her hearing very painfully.
She said that the allies, in her opinion, have been the US and the Federal Republic of Germany for decades, such an observation of the head of government are unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share details about Angela Merkel’s phone conversations with the German prosecutor’s office.
The German flew to Moscow to meet a former CIA employee.
Bashkiria may auction grain before the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria may, during state procurement interventions, put grain at auction before the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
While the price in the market is higher, there is demand.
"Maybe grain will be auctioned after the New Year," he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that this year the crops of agricultural crops for the 2013 harvest amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of cereals - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
In 2014, 550 thousand hectares were planted (by 105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
Increased areas under winter wheat and triticale, rose remained at the previous level.
In the bases of the Ministry of the Interior there is no group "Brother Circle", to which Leps has been assigned in the United States
In the databases of Russian military personnel of the “Brother Circle” group, to which Washington has assigned singer Gregory Leps, does not matter.
As noted by "Interfax" in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after reports appeared in the media about the entry by the U.S. Treasury Ministry Grigory Leps in the checklists on suspicions of belonging to the non-Eurasian crime syndicate "Brother Circle", all were checked.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia", which allegedly operates abroad, according to the forces structures.
"Even in the very name - 'Brother Circle', there is some element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret log.
“It’s all very like a peer-to-peer action,” the agency’s spokesman said.
On October 31, the U.S. Treasury announced the inclusion in its checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother Circle" Arthur Badalyan, Gregory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalyn, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov Igorbal Shybasky.
Those included on this list are suspected of having links to some of the Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on the US sanctions list since February 2012.
According to U.S. authorities, Gregory Leps "will serve as a courier to deliver money on behalf of Vladimir Leontiev".
At the production center of Gregory Leps, they refused to comment on the US charges against the singer, calling them a "breed".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama named the Brotherhood as “significant transnational organised criminal groups” and ordered the MINFIN “to undermine and prevent their global criminal operations.”
The inclusion of a person on the blacklists of the U.S. Mint will result in the blocking of its assets in the U.S. and a ban on business contacts with persons residing in the United States.
Scandalous video has come to the police
The head of Toronto, Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly unreasonable outings, fell on crack smoking.
Police in the Canadian city said they have a video and are ready to launch an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reported.
The information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford has appeared on the Toronto police website.
The head of local law enforcement, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this issue.
The sheriff said he is not authorized to share the data with the public, but he is responsible for their existence.
According to Blair, Rob Ford’s compromising video was discovered during an anti-drug raid carried out by guards in the summer of 2013.
Earlier on the existence of this video was written by the Canadian press, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself does not make any comments on this.
He just says he's not guilty of anything and he's not going to resign.
The video found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of 35-year-old friend Ford Alexander Lissi, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, obtaining illegal income, as well as criminal conspiracy.
At times, Lizzie served as Rob Ford's driver.
The city has long been demanding the resignation of its mayor.
He has repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in the public in a drunken form, allowed himself to make racist and sexist statements.
Rostovaeroinvest Ltd. has recognised the German company Assmann Beraten <0x2B> Planen as the winner of the tender for the choice of the project’s generator.
The amount of the contract is not disclosed in Rostov-Aeroinvest.
According to the press service of OAO, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, under the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent to the state examination in the spring of 2014.
The winner will design a new passenger terminal at the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, inland roads and elements of the airport complex’s well-being.
In the first phase of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50 thousand square meters, in the future it is possible to increase.
The project documentation will take into account the prospects of the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
At the time of the submission of the tender, the architectural concept of the aerospace complex "South", developed by the British company Twelve Architects, was determined.
The construction of the main terminal embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities in the world.
Assmann Beraten <0x2B> Planen has experience in the implementation of large projects, the company has designed terminals C and E "Sheremetyevo International Airport" and a new aerodrome complex at the international airport "Knevichi" in Vladivostok.
The international airport complex "South" will be built in the Aksai district of Rostov region and will replace the existing airport, which will be closed and in the future integrated into the city building.

Politician in Turkey declares a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, authorities began the construction of a partition wall in the area of the city of Nusaibin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the Prosecutor’s Party of the PMD strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaibin Aisha Gekhan, on the border with Syria, has declared a famine, protesting against the construction of a partition wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, according to RIA News in the press service of the Party of Peace and Democracy.
The police have repeatedly sparked protests.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammar Güler first denied the fact of the construction, then said the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"Mr. Nusaibina Aisha Hekhan, a member of the PMD, has declared a famine, thus turning its protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," the party's press service said.
The mayor believes the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from each other, the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhumane situation that the Kurds will never agree with,” said Ayshe Hekhan.
According to the press service, on November 7 in Nusaibin is planned to hold a rally against the construction of the partition wall.
Venezuela to set exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency - the bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
On November 1, the Bloomberg news agency reported, referring to a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand U.S. dollars in a year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the country’s purchased bolivars at the time of departure.
The specific price of the bolivar against the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars for a dollar.
However, in the black market one dollar is estimated at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, Bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
Oil industry minister and vice president of economy Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the rate of the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of deterring the prices of products and commodities of broad consumption, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to a shortage of a number of commodities and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Andrey Belmach, director of the game, said it was difficult to say how much time it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation occurred just a few hours ago, so to say how much time it will take to find a new coach, I’m not ready,” says Itar-TASS.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are looking at all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I want not just to find a coach, but a person who will work in our club for a few years and achieve certain results with him.
Kenyan press is outraged by provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there are reasons for the question: what could prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” she told the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very strict and punishable, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news website.
He said the new media judiciary would “always be addictive as it is a continuation of the government” and content and advertising restrictions would harm Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope that the president will listen to us, and we are appealing to him with a request to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law will essentially allow the government to "take the media dead" and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "has received a serious blow" and criticized the bill as "draconian".
The bill is part of measures taken to strengthen national security after the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Mall.
Kenyan media have sparked anger by broadcasting surveillance camera footage where troops who were sent to the site of the attack are allegedly robbing an expensive shopping mall.
The response of police chief David Kimaio was a call for two journalists and a media official to be interviewed, although the call was cancelled after mass media protests.
According to the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists — up to one million with an additional risk of being “excluded from the lists”, i.e. getting a ban on receiving official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations.”
She also said these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s so-called “resurrected blogosphere”.
Politicians understand that by forcing the media to shut up, they will be able to do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” said Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of deterrent and balancing forces in public life.
“The politicians entrusted to themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted for the cancellation of the reductions appointed by the National Wage Commission, and the restoration of their huge salary of around 532,000 shillings a month, which is one of the highest in the world.
In the utility payments of the robbers will appear a new line of expenses - deductions on the capital repair of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact norm will be determined by the government of the region.
But when you paint the entrance, put the staircase cells in order, or even replace the elevator - the residents will decide for themselves.
This law was approved by the members of the regional duma.
Vladimir Keychnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, it is also necessary to set the order - to establish the order of the roofing of houses, to accumulate funds not in the management companies - which will be a lot of facilities, we will have a lot of controls, it is in Moscow, where it is still in Oren.
It is now under the control of the state and partial construction.
The law protecting against fraud is endorsed in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people have been injured by dishonest builders.
Most of the problems were solved.
By the way, the new law lays down rights and responsibilities for all participants in the construction of shares.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that abuses in this sphere have also begun, due to the fact that in the 98th year the same shareholders fell, and in the 2000s the same shareholders."
People started earning on it to cover the gap, including, adopting these two laws.
Under Voronezh it was decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign citizens to be deported.
The regional parliament has passed such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
The problem associated with illegal migrants in the region is at least distracted.
So last year, there were just over 100,000 foreigners on the migration account.
But only one in five has issued an official work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, president of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They violated the legislation, but they are not criminals."
There are no ships, but we have to deport them, we have to keep them somewhere.
This decision was made by the federation that by regional means such places should be equipped.
In Voronezh region such a place is definitely the Old Olshanka Semiluk district.
Well, lastly, the regional parliament has given new advantages to multi-child parents.
First, families with five or more children are completely exempt from the transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million – but the same savings are multi-children’s parents.
Secondly, and this is the most important thing, for those who adopt 3 or more children, from the new year will be granting housing subsidies.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at the price of 30,000 per meter.
The family, for example, out of 6 people - a father, a mother, a native child and a 3rd - adopted.
For them, according to the norms, the state acquires a housing area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the southwestern microregion - a quite acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage for this amount in the skyscraper.
Baumgertner nominated to the board of directors "Uralkalia"
The current board of directors of Uralkali Corporation has proposed the candidacy of the arrested in Minsk CEO Vladislav Baumgertner for the new board, according to the website of the Russian company.
Bamughertner was included in the list of 11 people nominated to the new board of directors.
This list was prepared for the extraordinary meeting of shareholders on November 29, which will determine the new composition of the Board of Directors by voting.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
During his detention in August this year, he was charged with abuse of official powers.
However, later on, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said at a press conference that the accusations of Baumgertner were re-qualified as "theft".
Gatekeeper "Petrochemistry" Matt Dalton refused to comment on Vladimir Krikunov's departure from the post of mentor of the Nizhnekamts.
Golkipper believes that the acting head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys great authority among the players and will cope with his responsibilities.
Recall, today, the "Petrochemist" sent Krikunov to resign.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov, - quotes Dalton RIA "News".
All I can say is that Dmitry Balmin will cope with his commitments - I have no doubt about that.
In the team he enjoys great authority, this young specialist certainly awaits a great future.
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the upcoming match of the Italian championship with Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coaching staff has decided not to include him in the application for the game in order to save before the match of the 4th round of the Group of the Champions League with Real Madrid.
They will also not take part in the match against "Parma" Lichtsteiner, Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x87> and Pepe.
And forward Fabio Qualjarella recovered from the injury and is ready to play.
The fuel travel will lead to a tax maneuver, which provides for an increase in the tax on the mining of minerals (VAT) on oil at the same time as a reduction in export duties and an increase in excise duties.
According to experts, these measures could bring an additional 619.3 billion rubles to the budget.
The president of the Krasnoyarsk court stole the certificate, hitting him on the head
The unknown attacked the president of the Krasnoyarsk county court Vladimir Dvoekonko, stealing his certificate.
According to Interfax, in the late evening of Wednesday, the attackers hit the judge's head, which is why he lost consciousness.
When the 63-year-old president of the court came to his senses, he found that he had been issued an official certificate.
The money and other values were not taken by the criminals.
Duekonko arrived home on his own, and he only called the police the next day.
Investigation of crime and the search for criminals is underway.

U.S. Secretary of State: Intelligence sometimes “walked too far” when collecting data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that when collecting data and hearings, U.S. intelligence services sometimes “walked too far,” however, the politician noted that the information on the hearing that appeared in the media does not correspond to the reality of the 70 million people.
I assure you that innocent people have not been harmed during this process, but an attempt to gather information has been made.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was of an unlawful nature.
I acknowledge this as the president acknowledges it... and we will make sure it doesn’t happen in the future,” the secretary of state quoted AFP as saying.
Italian workers with internships take the road to young people
Italy’s unemployment is breaking records.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country’s population is now without work.
So bad things have not happened since the Second World War.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of people aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
According to the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already undertaken by the country’s largest energy company, and the laws adopted allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement for internship workers.
On the other hand, Italy has a common problem for Europe with the ageing population.
And economists are not sure that the excitement with the premature rotation of the personnel justifies itself.
What will the construction of the TPU in Moscow lead to?
Every year, the capital authorities promise to set up more transport and transfer nodes (TPUs).
By 2020, 255 TPUs are planned to be put into operation.
What the project is really about, our correspondent understood.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence emerged at the subway "Smolenskaya" Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line.
The inscription stated that the installation of the transport and transfer node is underway.
All this was very strange, since near "Smolenskaya" no ground transportation stops and, therefore, can not be relocated to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you need to overcome about 130 meters, including the ground crossing through the Karmanic Trail.
Now Smolensk is almost done.
The floral larek disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt before the entrance was replaced by a broomstick.
That's the whole transport chain.
Transport and transfer nodes are flat and capital, - explain in the press service of the capital's transport department.
There are no capital TPUs yet.
And the flats involve the construction of parking spaces, the removal of commercial facilities that hinder the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and the renovation.
In fact, flat TPUs are not even carried out by transporters, but by professional repairers from the department of capital repair of the city of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex structure, explains Michael Blinkin, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes there are enough roofs above the head and a sign warning of the time of arrival of the transport.
Here, for example, the subway "Yasenevo" recently opened a fully-fledged flat transplant node.
Let's go without covers, but with an intrusive parking lot and a sign indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in the pursuit of the number of officials recorded in the TPU anything that happens.
As early as 2011, the mayor planned to build on all of the 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
There are now 255 TPUs in the plans for 2020.
One-and-a-half of them are promised to give up this year.
Although there is a TPU development program in the city, no quality criteria are indicated, - notes Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization "City and transport".
They are reported by the number of objects, but the quality of transplantation on each of them often deteriorates.
The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: first - the reduction of transplant time, second - the convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transportation without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, with the installation of TPU sometimes comes the exact opposite.
A bright example of the subway "VDNH".
Previously, suburban buses from Yaroslavsky highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the VVC.
Now their stops were moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to Kosmonavtov Street.
Far from the subway, far away from the monorail, but closer to residential houses.
The reason is that the residents absolutely did not want the bus station under the windows and complained in all possible instances.
With capital TPUs in Moscow did not happen at once.
The first of them began to be built five years ago at the subway "Planernaya".
The project was designed to be exemplary.
And it really turned out to be an example of how the transplanted node, dedicated for the redemption of investors, turns into a banal trading center.
No, there's bus blinds, a shuttle to not go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking.
True, chemical trollbuses No202 and No203 in Moscow TPU places did not give in principle.
They were taken away as strangers from the subway.
There are still more places to trade.
There are only 32 stores of clothing, and there are almost everything - from the zoo to the car salon.
In fact, which of the passengers on the bus will suddenly need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital TPU, for some reason, we always get a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion, when part of the parking lot decided to put it on the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planernaya" among the marked parking spaces on the floor is fighting trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech, and guards, who look badly at our photographer.
The replanting node has finally become a bazaar.
The thing is, the subway "Planernaya" had a market before, but it was taken down.
And in the prefecture, the merchants were regretted and released to the intercepting parking of the overseas node.
However, due to the high prices there is always empty.
The funniest thing is that the market was scrapped to build a new flat TPU in its place.
That's the rocking.
The metro "Kaluzhskaya" the distance from the metro lobby to the bus was 50 meters, - tells Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you need to go through the entire shopping mall.
After 22 hours when it is closed, it has to be circumvented under the open sky.
However, the constructions on "Planerna" and "Kaluzhskaya" will soon appear flowers.
In mid-September, the city and land commission of the mayor approved planning solutions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25-storey, except for two or three underground floors.
The main monster will grow at the subway "Tushino", in it will be 418.7 thousand square meters.
Representatives of the Directorate of Railway Stations of RZD, responsible for the construction of the TPU at the metro, have already told reporters: in the future multi-storeys there will be shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials ensure that the multi-storey parking lots are muted from a third to half of the square.
Take, for example, “people” garages.
For example, the garage for 258 car seats, which was recently built on International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
So, for parking on 2.6 thousand cars, "Petrovsko-Razumovskaya" will need about 80 thousand "square".
That’s less than a third of the car we’re going to build.
Let one or two floors go to any shuttle for buses.
There is a minimum of 150 thousand square meters of commercial property.
And that's, for a minute, almost two GUMs.
If the capital TPUs at the stations and stations are built by railways, the rest of the stadiums will be conquered by the metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many "functional facilities", including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, in the property department of the city of Moscow recently told journalists that they are drafting a draft decree, according to which investors will be able to contact the officials directly for obtaining a plot for TPU.
Without any competitions.
Therefore, I said that transport issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the station "Harvard" in Boston or "Spain" in Toronto, - said Alexander Morozov.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the metro level and the distance from the metro wagon to the tram is only 50 meters without exit to the street.
There's no more trade around.
But Moscow officials are dropping in extremes.
Either we’re not going to build anything, or we’re already building 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to equate with extremism the insult of patriotic feelings
For the legislative protection of patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, “Just Russia” proposes to equalize the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activity and punish for it for five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Izvestia, such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the government for a verdict.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of the person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for that country, responsible for his destiny, respect for his history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, in domestic law there are sanctions for abuse of formal signs of state power - flag and emblem.
At the same time, according to parliamentarians, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be affected by insulting state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, is not working enough in Russian legislation.
As an example, he brings the annual Victory Day debates, when some media figures allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real vaccanalia is held annually.
Exercising in sharpness and an "alternative view" of history, some publicists come to the conclusion that, unfortunately, the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I think this is absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main “spiritual anchor” of the nation,” Oleg Mikheev said.
In addition, according to Mikheev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious people, but at the same time the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and it is possible to insult patriotic feelings virtually with impunity.
According to the popular electorate, it is necessary to equalize the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activity and to prescribe the corresponding punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for a penalty for insulting patriotic feelings: from a 100,000 fine to a 5-year prison term.
An earthquake of magnitude 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, in the area of the city of Kokimbo in central Chile, according to Reuters.
The earthquake’s focus was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometres and 54 kilometres southwest of the city, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).
The hits were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 1 November in Moscow).
There are no reports of casualties or damage caused by underground thrusts yet.
Chile is located in one of the most seismic regions of the Earth, so earthquakes of various forces are not uncommon there.
One of the most serious things happened in 2010.
The 8.8 magnitude earthquake and the tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960, it recorded a magnitude of 9.5.
As a result of this natural disaster, more than 5,000 people were killed.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists will be examined in strict compliance with Russian law.
France may have no doubt that the trial will be conducted in compliance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
“We can guarantee compliance with the laws,” Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detained activists of Greenpeace is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizanius, like other activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
“I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen,” Mr. Ero said.
“Our country cannot support activities that can cause harm to the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws,” Medvedev said.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including the extraction of energy carriers, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were "like a powder jar", and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, reports RIA Novosti.
UN announces new targets to overcome poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals to replace the GDPR, which expires in 2015, before the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening.
They were included in the final version of the document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit that it was time to “be above national interests.”
“I am pleased that the UN member states have agreed to initiate and take over the process of establishing universal sustainable development goals – the GDPR,” he said.
These MDGs will be based on our progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to exercise the powers conferred on me by Member States to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of conflict of influential people
Under the statues of Samora Mashel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant slogans about the world at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want the world back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Susa, CEO of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business outfit to a T-shirt, decorated with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital Independence Square.
Over the course of two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo have been reported – one of the most violent clashes since the truce was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, supported first by the white Rhodesian authorities and then by the South African government of the apartheid era as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to turn to a full-scale conflict again, but recent developments have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
The rates are high for the fast-growing economy, as the opening of huge shelf gas and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than <0x24>50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Ana Vale from Brazil.
The ruling Frelimo Party, a leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo Party have accused each other of the tensions that have arisen.
The Renamo Party claims that the government became the originator of the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional siege of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on the former insurgents then escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, reported to the Financial Times newspaper Fernando Mazanga, a representative of Renamo.
The government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armand Ghebuz has tried to evoke concerns about instability.
Hebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt himself a “failure” who wanted to use “everything left in his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears rose after the news that Mazang had declared Renamo's resignation from the 1992 peace deal.
He told the Financial Times that he meant non-compliance with the Freemo Party agreement.
“Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness,” Mazang said.
The previous negotiations between the parties have done little to alleviate the tensions that have been heightened by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Hebuza and Dhlakama) who have collided with their lips,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to go to the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which is based on former Renamo member, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazang said that Mr. Gebuza, who is due to step down next year when his second term ends, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the office of president,” Mazang said.
It is unclear what opportunities Renamo has, but she has already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on the key highway leading from north to south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beirut — a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railways about a week after Renamo threatened an attack on the railway.
Mazanga was evaded when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going very well in Mozambique,” Mazang said.
The instability has exacerbated dissatisfaction with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development rates and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and they must find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuan, who participated in the demonstration, said people just wanted stability.
“No one cares, neither Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want the rest of the world, they want free access to the roads,” he said.
The series of premiere exhibitions "Art-mainstream" will take place in Moscow
The series of cinema exhibitions "Art-mainstream", where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their lease, will take place in the cinema "Rolan" from 1 to 5 November, RIA "News" organ on the project.
Opens the program "Art-mainstream" of the French comedy director and actress Rémy Kerici "Paris at any cost".
This is the story of a model working in the French capital Maye (Kerici herself), who is deported to her home country due to problems with the visa – to Morocco.
In addition to the film Kerici will also show the viewers a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duck "Mebius", a melodramatic play by Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: The Story of Love" (Diana) with Kaphasy's "The Story of Love" with Naomi Watts "The Protagonist and the Protagonist"
The only Russian participant "Art-mainstream" will be the winner at the festival "Kinotaur" film of Alexander Veledinsky "Geographer Globe Propeller" on the motives of the novel of the same name Alexey Ivanov.
The main role - the enchanting failure teacher Victor Slushkin - in the film was played by Konstantin Habensky, whose work was also awarded the "Kinotaur" award.
Children should study myths and legends as “lifestyle models,” the author says.
Stories about Thor could show that “a brute force cannot defeat a subtle trick,” and legends about King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too reckless to teach in schools,” Crossley-Holland advocates a “careful selection” of appropriate texts by age.
“I think it’s great that myths and folklore are already part of education in America,” he said.
I was in favour of introducing them to a 20-year training program.
He added that the “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “distracts” children, and the main ideas are “sublimated” in fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote a collection of Norwegian myths for Penguin and British folk tales, said, “You may have intentions, but you better keep them with you.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but that there should be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
The old principle is to show, not tell.
In Voronezh region detained football fan who broke the window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o'clock in the evening of October 29 at the Gryazi-Voronezh station, transport police officers removed from the passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region.
After going to the game of the favorite team, the guys set up a drunken debosh on the train.
The young people were transported to the station of the linear police station at Grazi station for the preparation of a protocol of administrative offence.
There the fans repented of their anti-social behavior.
The police put up administrative material on them and released it.
The young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station began to wait for his arrival.
In the first half of the night, fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, unexpectedly returned and broke the window of the entrance door in the waiting room of the station.
On the bell of the broken glass, the transport police officer and the guard of COP "RZD" fell.
They managed to arrest the attacker who tried to hide from the scene of the incident.
Employees of the South-East LU Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are conducting an inspection.
The issue is about the initiation of a criminal case, said Sergei Olhovik, senior referencer of the South-East Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport.
Vitaly Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we're back 15 years ago.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots at the stands during the match of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I am in favour of the organizers of all these sports events: clubs, leagues, the Russian Federation.
But we can see that they have taken a bad position.
They're waiting for someone from the side to come and make arrangements.
This is a very good position, but not quite right.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, not let the case go alone.
We have now drafted a special government regulation on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will deal closely with this problem.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process to me.
I read Leonid Fedoun's interview.
State, please, give the law a hurry.
The feeling is that the fans of "Bavarian" came to Yaroslavl and arranged it all.
We are external observers.
And in general, it's awful to see the tribune bend out of the brandspot.
This is a country that is preparing for the World Cup.
“I have a feeling that we came back 10-15 years ago,” Mutko said.
Snowflakes can be questioned in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden is unlikely to go beyond Russia to testify on the case of hearing German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone talks.
According to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the American can answer questions from representatives of the German prosecutor’s office in writing or directly in Russia.
Edward Snowden’s exit from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he will lose refugee status and may be handed over to Washington by countries - allies of the United States," the agency's spokesman said.
"However, in principle, the Federal Prosecutor's Office could send its representatives to the Russian Federation or send written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that this question should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, German Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele said Edward Snowden was ready to testify on the case of a hearing by the U.S. intelligence services of the German Chancellor's negotiating process.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or on the territory of Germany.
A former CIA official has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the U.S. NSA blocked all its movements, Snowden was ready to come to Germany.
However, for this, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival,” Strabele told Euronews.
Snowden’s lawyer Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement from the Interfax source, said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he will decide for himself.
U.S. Citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information about U.S. intelligence intelligence operations on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow by transit, but was unable to leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was cancelled by the U.S. authorities, allegedly making serious charges against him, and until early August remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport.
On August 1, Snowden received a document on granting him temporary asylum in the territory of Russia for a period of one year and on the same day left Sheremetyevo.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren said that his client had arranged for work in a "large Russian company".
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel was reported by German media last week.
According to reporters, the American chancellor’s phone talks began to be heard in 2002.
The tracking station was reportedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
Following the publication of the report, the German authorities said that Merkel’s tracking violated Germany’s laws and sovereignty.
Ponomarev has left "fair Russia"
A member of the State Duma from the "Just Russia" party, a member of her office in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, filed a declaration of exit from the political organization.
As stated by the parliamentary, he filed a statement to the Novosibirsk regional office of the party.
According to her statutes, this automatically means that Ponomarev left the ranks of "righteous".
We're sitting, drinking tea...
“For some reason, many want to see the picture ‘Ilya Ponomarev puts a ticket on the table,’ but there is nothing so epochal about it,” the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional office of "assassins".
Meanwhile, the mandate of the deputy of the State Duma Ilya Ponomarev is not intended to be renounced.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and cannot by law get out of it.
Messages about Ilya Ponomarev’s intention to leave the party “Just Russia” appeared on October 30.
It was reported that along with him Dmitry Goodkov and Valery Zubov will come out of the "SR", but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan to discuss with Russia the issue of concluding a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Fumio Kisida, met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“We would like to frankly exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of the peace treaty,” Kissid said at the meeting.
Japan’s Foreign Minister recalled that after Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and became bilateral.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation will meet Japan in solving complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of the peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies the resolution of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this connection, protests are taking place in Tokyo today demanding that the country return the land lost after World War II.
The Japanese capital is surrounded by cars, from which the speaker says: "Return the northern territories!".
The police are not stopping the protesters, they are watching to ensure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be said that New York is the birthplace of the stand-up comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the street artist Frank Fay, who worked at a conference at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the audience.
The novelty of Faye has been captured over time by other, most recently - the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolinas club stand, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, counting more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners started at the Carolinas, and then they were more successful, reached a level when they were already too famous to perform at the club," said Hirsch.
We have created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes performances by Vandy Sayx, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as “Stendap for Heroes” – an annual musical and comedy charity concert for military veterans at the Djung Jyunt in the Madison-square-garden, the Upper Wharf, and the Upper Wharf.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year have gained popularity in an unconventional way, for example, thanks to shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll gained fame for his role in a comedy series on a little-known cable TV channel (especially the scrambled FXX "Liga" on the fantasy football theme), and now runs his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the cast both in "Saturday Night Live" and in "Parks and Recreation Areas", although she is best known for the series of viral videos "Marseille - a skull in boots".
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a distinctive style (surrealistly pessimistic Anthony Jesselnic, a cowardly, racially-focused Kamau Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be the interview of David Steinberg with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful director on television and in film, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the lead on TV Land's Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is certainly a central element of all Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walks down a street between the two houses and thinks, “If I’m completely out of money, maybe I’ll live here.”
Pakistani authorities begin negotiations with local Taliban forces
Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the embassy of the country in the UK, where Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan is visiting.
The Prime Minister of Pakistan made a statement on talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister said the dialogue with the Taliban had begun," the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
"He said he hopes and prays that dialogue will work in accordance with Pakistan's constitution," the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the same-named Afghan movement, but operate independently in the northwestern regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
Previously, the government of Islamabad had attempted to start talks with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to engage in dialogue.
It said it would go to talks only if the authorities took troops stationed in areas where the Taliban were operating permanently and freed the detained Islamists from prisons.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Pakistani Prime Minister and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London to discuss the prospects of the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell to <0x24>96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about the formation of large stockpiles eclipsed a message showing that China’s energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining strength.
The U.S. benchmark oil in December’s supply fell by 14 cents, and its price was <0x24>96.24 per barrel later in the morning at European time in electronic auctions on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell by 39 cents, which amounted to a 5.8 percent drop in the October price.
Rich oil reserves have impacted its value in recent weeks.
The energy ministry said on Wednesday that U.S. stockpiles increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, the stocks were replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports about the Chinese industry, which demonstrated an increase in its activity.
This indicates that China’s economic recovery could continue to gain strength after the growth rate rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent oil, a benchmark international oil used by U.S. oil refineries, has decreased by 26 cents to <0x24>108.58 per barrel on the Intercontinental Stock Exchange in London.
The head coach of Colorado, Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the goalkeeper Semen Varlamova from the first minutes of Friday's game with Dallas, expressed confidence that the last night behind bars did not stifle his confidence in the Russian.
“What are we waiting for,” Rua said after the morning call “Lavine.”
Of course, what has happened worries us all, but we are confident of him and we feel that it will be useful for him to get out on the ice today.
We want him to get out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're completely sure that the situation didn't affect the condition of the porter?
Today, we'll see.
Undoubtedly, our players will support Varley by helping him keep the goal, as it was in previous games this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court finds out.
In Siberia, you should not be a vegan: a greenhouse tomato will not replace a soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for living in Siberia, RIA Novosti said.
People who have completely abandoned foods of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
Here they do not tolerate the winter without loss of health, and no greenhouse tomatoes compensate them, according to Vegan Day polled Novosibirsk dietitians and doctors.
Drinking oil in liters
Strict vegetarianism, when you give up not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dieticians are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict nutritional norms is at least unhealthy.
Complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for by plant.
It is necessary to include in the diet at least milk or eggs,” - said dietitian Marina Bogay.
It is an example of fish that contains essential omega-3 fatty acids.
The richest vegetable oil they have is linseed.
"In order to consume it in the amounts necessary for a person, you need to drink in litres!" - says the dietitian.
Doctors are confident that the people of Siberia should pay special attention to the diet in the winter.
This season, vegetarianism is especially challenging.
Under the conditions of our reality, there are high demands for food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased calorie level.
“If a person limits himself to animal products, he does not get that calorie,” says the specialist.
This is agreed by dietitian Olga Posnjak.
It adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not the way out.
It is better for a person to eat predominantly foods that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed for better absorption and digestion of these products.
And in winter, people don’t want a cucumber to bite, but a hot soup or something more saturated,” explains the doctor.
According to her, the fact that vegans can be eaten is actually useful for various grains, cereals, beans, local vegetables, apples left in the winter, frozen berries.
But this is certainly not enough for a full-fledged diet.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, the levels of vitamins in Siberian organisms are sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and the snow lies in May, is unsuitable.
The body needs energy for life, and that is, first of all, fat,” says the doctor.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need building materials, including in the form of amino acids.
And by sticking to vegetarianism, we give them incomplete.
Pregnant women also need increased protein, vitamins and micronutrients in the menu.
“The vegans don’t get them,” he said.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose whatever he wants, "play the toys he wants."
It has already formed organism, skeleton, organs.
Kids need to eat fully.
If parents deprive him of some micronutrients or amino acids by choosing for him what he will eat, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
“The lack of some substances for brain development, vision, bones, will not be restored tomorrow,” she says.
All the medical specialists surveyed agree on the low quality of the crops grown in the winter in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains less of the micronutrients we need than (grown) in open ground.
“The quality of the products is not that,” God says.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to collect more crops is detrimental to quality.
"Apples don't turn brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly yellow and mold, tomatoes are tasteless and unpleasant," - says the doctor, adding that they are most likely drunk with excess amounts of fertilizer.
And they become suppliers, not of vitamins, but of fiber.
This is not in agreement with the Laboratory of the Siberian Physical and Technical Institute of Agricultural Problems, the candidate of the peasantry sciences Vera Petrouk.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all the norms and requirements in greenhouses it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If you try to eject more from a square meter, then of course, and watering will become more frequent, and overfeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened,” she explains, adding that the question of quality, first of all, depends on the manufacturer’s conscience.
Court suspends enforcement of ruling on the practice of “stop-and-stop” in New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the enforcement of a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department’s “stop-and-stop” program, and removed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. District Court of Appeal said the execution of Judge Shira Shandlin's ruling would be suspended until the results of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how it implemented a program of street arrests and interrogations.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and its resolutions on corrective measures, including the order to appoint an inspector to help the police department change its work practice and related training program.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a hearing on the request for suspension of the case.
The Court of Appeal has stated the need for the dismissal of the judge because it violated the U.S. Code of Conduct of Judges and did not consider the need to avoid the demonstration of prejudice, partly because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court’s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unreasonably appealing to blacks and Latin Americans under the “Stop-and-Stop” program.
It appointed an external controller to monitor major changes, including policy, training and control reforms, and decided to launch a pilot program to test the body-mounted video cameras in those police stations where most detentions are taking place.
In August, New York decided to stop the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were terminated after a police check.
The city’s appeals are due to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of “stop and search” has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
“Stop-stop” has been practiced for several decades in some form, but the number of documented stops has increased sharply under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record in 2011 for 684,330 people, most of whom are black and black.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, filed a collective lawsuit.
Proponents of the New York Police Department’s “Stop-and-Stop” program say that these changes will put an end to dishonest practices, create a more reliable and effective police service, and can affect how other departments are doing.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the fighting spirit of the police, not the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary spending of money, and will not solve a more global problem of complex conditions in the police because of the reduction in the number of officers by several tens of thousands per year.
The judge noted that she does not stop the practice of “stop-and-pass” that is consistent with the constitution, but changes the way New York police stop people.
In the area of Tretyakov Gallery opened a pedestrian zone
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the Tretyakov Gallery area and occupies a plot two kilometers from the metro station "Novokuznetskaya" to Bolotna Square.
Along the way, street torches, flower beds, ponds, urns and toilets are installed, deaf locks and illegal advertising are removed.
In addition to the Klimentovsky and Lavru<0xC5><0xA1>inski alleys, which were already pedestrians, five streets were closed for cars - the Ordinian stop, the Big and Small Tolmachev alleys, the Kadashev bay and the Bolot Square.
The movement of transport through the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not limited.
On the site of Friday Street from the lobby of the station "Novokuznetskaya" to Klimentovsky street conditions were created for pedestrians without removing the movement and cutting the passage parts, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian area were the Tretyakov Gallery, the temple of the priest of the Pope Clement of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, full pedestrians were Tverskaya Pass, Stole<0xC5><0xA1>nikovi intersection and Kuznetskyi Bridge Street.
The Great Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson resorted to hacking the phone to verify confidential message
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "the wrong phone, tracking, and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm the false information about Charles Clark's novel, which was the then Interior Minister's post.
Prosecutor Andrew Eddis told the Old Bailey court that in May 2005 News of the World received a mistrustful news that Clark was meeting his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper ordered private detective Glenn Mulcair to hack Polby’s voice mail and warned her at home to take an interview, but Coulson also called her and left voice messages, the court said.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand near someone’s house, hoping to stand someone in the dark, he’s the kind of person who likes to offer history to people to see what they’ll say.”
He said News of the World used three methods of investigating stories: phone hacking, tracking, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the tracking, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says no, we say, “Oh, yes!”
Rumors about Clark's novel attracted the attention of News of the World for the first time, when a source, sexually interested in Mrs. Polby, said, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
The cassette with voicemails received from her phone at least three times was removed from Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the computer of a private detective, in which Miss Polby and her sister were depicted as "Projects".
During the period when she was under surveillance, Mrs. Polby ' s grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls asking to provide information about her, Mr. Eddis said.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weezerap monitored Mrs. Polby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Eddis said that Coulson’s involvement in this story was in the same scenario as with other influential people, such as former Interior Minister David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson was confronted with Mr. Blankett about the romance with a married woman while he himself met the correspondent Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiracy with other people to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkier, Turlbeck and Weezerap confessed to hacking their phones.
Snowden declares willingness to talk with the German authorities on the hearing case
Former CIA officer Edward Snowden expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with representatives of the German authorities, RIA Novosti reports.
A letter from a former CIA employee to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday presented Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele, through which Snowden transmitted a message to the German authorities.
Sagittarius met Snowden in Moscow the day before.
As a result of the fire on Tver Street, four people were injured.
As a result of the fire in a collector in the center of Moscow, on Tver Street, four passers-by were injured.
According to Interfax, referring to a source in the emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passers-by who were at the time of the fire in an obscured underground transition were injured.
As RIA Novosti writes with reference to the head of the department of the fuel and energy economy of Pavlo Livinsky, now all houses on Tverskaya Street have completely restored electricity supply.
A fire in a heat collector near the house 15 on Tver Street occurred on the evening of October 31.
A strong smoke went out of the rain drainage pits, and in the underground passage, located at the store "Armenia", a suffocation was formed.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tver Street were encircled.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was eliminated.
U.S. cuts food allowance for the poor
Feed allowance for a family of four is reduced by <0x24>36 per month
Since Friday, the financial supply of food stamps known as "food stamps" has been declining in the U.S. as the relevant government program expires.
For food benefits, a family of four will now be allocated <0x24>36 a month less than before, officials say.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in 2012, the average per-person allowance was <0x24>133 per month.
Food aid spending in the United States has risen to <0x24>80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14% of Americans rely on free food aid issued under the “food stamps” that have been named after them since they had the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
Republicans in Congress, however, demand further cuts in funding for the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.
Food store owners across the U.S. are concerned that the cuts will lead to lower consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to argue as much as possible about reducing government funding.
Blizzard releases a 19-year-old platformer for free
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platform on PC for free.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game has become available on Battle.net in the classic Blizzard games section.
However, some gamers note that currently only those users whose accounts belong to the U.S. part of the service can download it.
For Russian users, the game is not yet available.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC is not externally different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
His events took place on the planet Toul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright King Vlaros and become the solitary ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death by being sent to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returns to Toul to fight Sarlak's hurricanes and protect the planet's inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game released by the studio after its renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
It was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was the publisher of Interplay.
In the Moscow metro there will be new machines.
But to sell tickets to passengers they will not be for the money, but for the sessions.
One trip worth 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 sessions.
The number of sessions will count the special device using modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Olympic Committee of Russia.
The first aircraft will be installed at the “Exhibition” station on November 8, 2013.
In the presentation of the new ticket athletes will receive the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia Alexander Zhukov and the Olympic champions gymnasts Alexey Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikov.
National Security Agency Recognition Increases Corporate Paranoia Against State Surveillance
On a warm day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew low above the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
According to the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, his task was to photograph the roof of the US office building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to detect the antennas of the hearing devices, and these actions led to talks between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, reaffirmed in September that the U.S. does not use external intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies in the interests of U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, a contract worker who has become a disclosure agent, began publishing his secret secret treasure of U.S. intelligence, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure if the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency oversaw Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised the paranoia of state-induced corporations to new heights.
The last drop was the announcement that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been heard for maybe about a decade.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, potential targets are also business leaders.
Snowden has made clear the intense cooperation between the U.S. intelligence services and the companies.
I think it's quite likely that this data is used for mutual benefit.
“Germany has to wake up,” says Oliver Grun, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by EY’s consulting agency.
In all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there was no evidence so far that the United States passed the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain opportunities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we need to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German company that provides software for business SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
All but the IT industry.
And yet the coverage and technical development of U.S. espionage agencies, known for Snowden’s revelations, has been a shock to some companies who previously thought that China poses the greatest risk of surveillance.
A major shift takes place in cloud technologies, where European company executives are better aware that data stored in the U.S. is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-American participants refused to use the services of a U.S.-based cloud provider after the unveiling of the U.S. Prism Intelligent Data Analysis Program.
Jim Sneeb, one of SAP’s CEOs, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that didn’t come up a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically stay in this jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders claim that the latest messages are just a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at any cost.
What economic espionage is happening is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and hasn’t changed significantly in the current controversy,” says Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them too, because it is in our national interest to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to boast of the retaliatory measures they have taken, as this can provide an advantage to the opponent.
Large companies have long been taught the idea that taking a free flash drive at the exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is at least unintended.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, said it had been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they could not be used as hearing aids.
The Federal Constitutional Protection Service of Germany recommends that company managers consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during travel abroad due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and tracking.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV report warns.
The US warns its own companies of economic espionage from other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Survey in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second row of hackers for economic intelligence, after China, the Washington Post says.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst of all.”
Bernard Scarsini, the former head of the French intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know very well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of a Georgian teenage boy who died by "stupid accident" believe their son was killed
The parents of a Georgian teenager whose body was found inside a twisted sports mat in his high school gym believe their son was killed, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertically standing mat leaning from behind to the stands in his high school gym.
Loundes County Sheriff's Office investigators have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family dispute this.
“They are absolutely convinced that their son was killed,” said Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed that he died as the sheriff said.
“They believe this is contrary to logic, the laws of physics, as well as common sense,” he said.
They think it’s a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and they brought him back in a bag for the bodies,” he said.
U.S. attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he is conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to know the truth.
"I hold to the opinion that there are sufficient grounds" for the official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the primary discovery showed that Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia."
However, the second revelation, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
“There are a few questions that should be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
A spokesman for the County Sheriff's Office was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to publish all surveillance camera footage that the investigators watched.
The teen’s parents said they hoped the videos contained the key to unraveling how he died.
"Spartak": For information on the persons who removed the fascist symbol
On the official website of "Spartak" appeared a statement of the Moscow club regarding the appearance of the fascist flag on the tribune in Yaroslavl.
"At the Cup match "Shinnik" - "Spartak" on October 30, unknown provocators at the stadium in Yaroslavl demonstrated a fascist symbolism.
We would like to contact all those who have reliable information about the persons who have committed this crime, requesting to provide it to the <0x3C>Spartak-Moscow FC security service" at the email address fcsmsec<0x40>spartak.com.
“The reward is guaranteed,” the statement said.
Looking for fans who hung out the fascist flag in Yaroslavl
Remember that in the match 1/16 of the final of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartak" was interrupted several times due to riots on the stands.
Also in the sector of the fans of "Spartak" was demonstrated fascist symbolism.
As a penalty, Spartacus can hold about three games without spectators.
A committee meeting will be held on Friday.
If you have any information about who passed and removed this symbol, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is growing.
Currently, one in 20 children in the United States has food allergies.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise the awareness of teachers and service staff about food allergies in children and how to provide assistance in case of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep their adrenaline reserves — most often for injections using the automatic medical syringe EpiPen — to help with potentially deadly anaphylaxis.
Legislative authorities have recently amended the regulation to allow schools to make adrenaline stockpiles with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Kids can say, “It feels like something is sticking in my tongue,” “It feels like I have hair on my tongue,” or “The tongue is a scissor.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “indefinite gender”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third gender in children born with external genital organs of the intermediate type.
Newborns will no longer have to be attributed to male or female.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate gender as “uncertain” or “uncertain” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions about the sex-assignment of newborns, and to counter discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex man, according to the BBC, said many years later, “I’m not a man or a woman.”
I'll stay the doctors-created slouchy product with bruises and scars.
Approximately one in two thousand children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that are diagnosed with “sexual development disorder” – a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (eggs or sperm) or unusually developed external genital organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification has not yet been studied enough, but most experts in the U.S. say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to take advantage of all available information and assign it to it than to wait and track the overall psychological and physical development of the child before carrying it out.
A New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said the new German law “sounds like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgical intervention, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can assign sex without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer the questions about why this is happening.
It’s like a mystery of why people are gay.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as being different from transsexuals or transgender because their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not unique to either male or female gender.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual features, such as muscle mass, distribution of hair, breast, and bodybuilding; primary sexual features, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosome and hormones.
The report also provides a general overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and crime on the basis of prejudice.
Boys with gender disabilities now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to put a male, female or “third floor” in their official documents.
In June, Australia’s 52-year-old Norrie May-Walby became the world’s first man to be declared “insecure” and defended the right to retain “undefined” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passports will use the third term in addition to M and F-X, i.e. intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still causing controversy, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this prominently Catholic country, signed a petition to remove the “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state, where gender is the subject of choice and sexual activity — no, we are turning two more pillars of civilization.”
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have their children set up sex at birth.
“It’s hard enough to raise a child without any additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told a parental website.
Kids need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genital organs were called hermaphrodites – in the name of the beautiful Greek god, who had the signs of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which everything can be erased and then painted again.
But now many are questioning the ethical grounds for surgical surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choices, not knowing how the child will perceive the gender assigned to him when he grows up.
“In the middle of the twentieth century, this was called an ‘emergency psychiatric case’,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn’t call a psychiatrist — you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermittent genitals was proposed by Dr. John Manny of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender could easily be changed.
He coined the term “gender identity” and claimed that environmental signals, including social signals — how parents grow a child — interact with the child’s genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as John/John, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during the negligent cut, to completely castrate the child, also removing his ovaries, and raising him as a girl.
“Many presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now some doctors are still “applying this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these gender-change operations declared themselves “dissatisfied with the result.”
This was also the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer who was born with male XY chromosomes but genitals of the intermediate type.
Doctors were not able to determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a man’s “full life.”
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s external genital organ and ovaries were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was given vaginal plastic.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he found out was awful.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder that did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for normal genital development.
Knowing the truth, he again became a man, getting testosterone shots and removing his breast.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he is defending others in the organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Anne Temar-Mattis, executive director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law “incitees labels and stigma to be worn.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an ‘indefinite gender’,” she said.
We're afraid he's going to contribute to the intervention.
We think it’s better to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is build assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law, as it "allows adults to make choices in favor of the third gender."
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sexuality,” she says.
German law implies its assignment at birth.
This is a battle in which young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based mammologist-render who has a daughter with a sexual dysfunction and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said German law "supports" both parents and children.
Barac's daughter, Kathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called "the syndrome of complete androgen insensitivity."
Since her androgen receptors are not working properly, Katie has developed female signs.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and attends the Department of Child Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite being infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make quick decisions on their own,” Barac said.
It gives them time to do some analysis and understand the situation, as well as the interval before they write “male” or “female”.
In this case, you are fine - grow up the child, love the child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't have to rush to an operation that's irreversible.
“This allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that moves parents because they don’t feel they’re doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide with what gender he or she is more comfortable with — and that’s great.
This gives children the opportunity to make decisions on their own.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Habibulin stressed: he understands that he has to play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard on training.
In the last two Yastrebov matches, Habibulin first missed six sweeps from Tampa Bay, then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed sweep.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I didn’t do that,” says Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in the training, I probably should approach them as a game, and try to achieve the best result.
You have to study your past games and work on those flaws that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel pretty good at training.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snow comm.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The opponents - I don't think I'm the only one - always try to make the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not excited.
It doesn’t matter what happens in front of my door.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss out on so many shavings.
It’s great that my teammates support it, but in principle it’s simple: I have to play better.
“Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to have them much better.
But it happened, what happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'm just going to try to win the next game better.

Medvedev expects that the SSJ-100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after fixing in the Latin American and Asian markets Superjet 100 aircraft will also be delivered to Europe.
“We expect that in total, we will get such agreements more than 170 copies of such aircraft,” said Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a press conference with the Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation with French colleagues has been established, as it is a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues that are related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in the Latin American markets and in the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that one day it will be delivered to France as well," the Russian prime minister said.
SSJ-100 - aircraft built by the company "Civil Airplanes Dry" in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
Energy companies of Dnepropetrovsk have launched a unique program to rescue... nests of Astians
In the old days, to bring to the court of the Assyrians, the peasants mounted a wheel from the cart on a high column, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special supports have not been put in place for a long time, so the Ais liked the columns of the transmission lines - the interwoven branches are based on the wire, thanks to which the real house stands reliably.
Grandma Anna, near the house of which the real family has lived in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district for twenty years, began to notice how the nest sits, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new branches on top, and the lower layer has already crossed between the wires, it will collapse.
Of course, unfortunately, the family of ashtrays, who each year nestled in the courtyards, brought out and fed three or four birds during the summer, but it is not desirable to be without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm edges, Grandmother Anna called to the Tsarichansky RUS, which belongs to the base.
I didn’t expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest is still in place at all, - told DTEK technical director "Dneproblanergo" Sergey Berezovsky.
On the wires, which were found, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, began corrosion.
At any time, the birds could have died from an electrical discharge.
Locals were also at risk of losing light due to wiring damage.
Therefore, linear mounters started the operation to save the nest, and this is not the first time in our practice.
Scientists-ornithologists from Dnepropetrovsk National University, who developed a scheme of niche transfer.
They also conducted trainings for district network employees.
The famous Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised energy professionals at all stages of the reconstruction of the nests.
To begin with, it was estimated that there are more than 50 real "apartments" in the area in an emergency.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were welded, reminiscent of a fork.
The foundation was plastered with ivory branches, and then moved the old nest there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay old branches as the basis for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
The Aesthetes will build their own homes.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka Novomoskovsky district.
Next to the electric boiler, a new iron concrete column was placed and a platform with an old, already inhabited nest was placed on it.
The entire operation cost the energy in nine thousand hryvnias.
And in the days of the same new settlement took place in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district on the courtyard of Grandma Ani.
Here the platform was fixed in the former place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that careful, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" was undergoing capital repairs.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected to include four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of Dnepropetrovsk.
By the way, while some rescue rare birds, others are ruthlessly killed.
During the days, the whole area was filled with sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the fasano hunt, the braconniers shot a squirrel family living on a local farm for entertainment.
Noble birds were not afraid of humans at all - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the brook, four beautiful foxes already lay dead on the water.
Now the staff of the Apostolovsky Ryotdela militia are finding out who shot the birds in the Red Book.
"Russian March" is becoming more popular
On November 4, on the Day of People's Unity, in Moscow will be held an agreement with the Mayor of the "Russian March".
According to the survey of the Levada Center, the support of the Russian marches is growing - already 40% of the citizens in different degrees approve of the idea of their conduct.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of the citizens in varying degrees approve of the Russian marches: 11% of them refer to such actions definitely positive and 29% - "quite positive".
The popularity of the idea of "Russian marches" gradually increases - in 2006, these shares were welcomed by only 14% of Russians, and in December 2010, the holding of such events already supported twice as many citizens (28%).
"Definitely negative" to "Russian marches" refer only 7% of Russians, "rather negative" - 19%.
Another 35% were unable to formulate their attitude to this action.
This year, the mayor of Moscow agreed to hold the "Russian march" of up to 15,000 people in Ljubljana, this was announced today by the head of the security department of the capital Alexei Maiorov.
This campaign of nationalists has been held every year on the Day of People’s Unity since 2005.
“Have you heard that on November 4, Russia’s “Russian Marches” are being held under the slogan of the protection of Russian rights in Russia?” three quarters (75%) of the population responded negatively.
Currently, only one in five Russians (20%) know about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 almost a third of the citizens (31%) heard about the "Russian marches".
Three years ago, on December 11, a natural nationalist rally took place on Manezh Square, which turned into mass riots.
Levada-center also asked the Russians about what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of people who know the correct answer (Day of People’s Unity) increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of the citizens are going to celebrate this holiday.
Approximately the same number (17%) intend to celebrate the 7 November Day of the October Revolution.
Most citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How Moscow’s mayor agreed the “Russian March” in Ljubljana
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the "Russian March" on 4 November in Ljubljana.
This was reported by the leader of the association "Russian", the organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the march to Ljubljana on the Day of People’s Unity will be held a rally and rock concert of the group “Kolovrat”, also agreed with the authorities.
How happened "Russian March-2012"
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, the nationalists marched from the Yakiman Bay to the Artist’s Central House, where the rally was held.
The organizers estimated the number of participants to 20,000 people, the Ministry of the Interior called the number 6 thousand.
Obama's Election Headquarters Considers Biden's Exclusion for Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton’s 2012 election list.
This discovery is the brightest sensation of all expected books by Mark Halperin and John Hailemann about the 2012 campaign "Double-Top: The Game Changed in 2012".
The Times received a copy of the book in preparation for its release and reported on Thursday evening that the president’s upcoming assistants conducted “scaling research in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether the exclusion of Biden could help.
According to the political observer The Times Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempt of the high-ranking officers of the pre-election headquarters and the White House, namely the former head of the administration of the White House, to assess the effect of the blaze-black-black-black-black-black-black-black-black-black-black-black.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded in the Chicago Pre-election headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former Obama election chief Jim Messin and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew the replacement was under consideration.
The book "Double Stools" claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden, despite their "close personal relationship", but ultimately abandoned that step when their data showed that Clinton's addition to the electoral list was not a "fault."
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered the possibility of replacing Biden Clinton.
“I’ve been actively speaking out for a lot of things, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
You should remember that at the time the president was in terrible shape, so we thought, “Oh, my God, what are we going to do?”
While Daley described the study as a “necessary verification,” Martin told CNN spokesman Anderson Cooper that the election headquarters had invested enough in exploring whether the move would bring a dividend to the vote.
“Election headquarters don’t spend such sums of money on polls and focus groups unless they take something seriously,” Martin told AK 360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of replacing.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about a possible move.
While Daley said he didn’t think the president was “aware” of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration admitted that “maybe” Obama knew.
Martin added that the “double stacks” do not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political probe came to Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously believed that Obama had no idea about the study of the possibility of excluding Biden from the election list.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want a light in the dark of ice cream?
The British entrepreneur created the world’s first glowing in the dark ice cream with the help of a meduza.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a sea animal to develop luminous food.
He came to this idea by reading a scientific article on medusas, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the luminous protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, increasing the pH level in the protein and causing it to shine.
Chris says that as the ice cream starts to shine when it responds to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you slide, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company, "Lick me, I'm delicious," says, "It's an amazing thing, but it's still at the very beginning, if you're talking about production, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you'll get about 2 grams of substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth warms up the protein, it will increase your pH level and the ice cream will start to glow.
We’ve been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed to be perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful luminous effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the lumenscene of a meduza is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it's pretty nice to taste.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of salty gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is by definition impossible because of the breakdown caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice Cream Uses Fluorescent Properties of Medusa Synthesized by Chinese Scientists
Trainer "Avangarda" Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the match of the regular KHL championship against "Salavat", noted that the omists carried out a thorough analysis of the loss from the magnetogorsk "Metallurg".
The specialist stressed that "Avangard" should pay increased attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video game against the magnetogorsk "Metallurg", - the official website "Avangard" of the word Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of laundry, not a very nice moment.
They missed because of their mistakes, because of the failure of the game task.
We knew the competitor had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks on the move - three laundrymen shot us.
A very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account when preparing for today’s game?
We and the guys understand each game carefully, talk after the game, prepare for a new rival.
The main thing is that the installation is done.
Everyone saw the first period of the game against Metallurg.
The game was played, and the score was 2:0.
They missed the goal "in the dressing room" - and in the third period they started to make mistakes.
Considering how difficult the game was to fold, there was no sense in connecting the defenders.
We have to defend the whole team.
Now the "Avangard" has a long home series, the matches go in the day - has the team accumulated fatigue?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now is the realization of your moments and the execution of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you run the installation - everything is not so difficult.
Due to the new rules introduced by Russian customs, hundreds of furs have been in a row on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and set up biotoilets
Hundreds of fur accumulated at the border posts when they entered Russia.
Such a situation arose due to a change in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm: it is the Russian side who has not warned of innovations in advance.
From October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said Deputy Head of Eastern Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document applies to countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Carriages.
Passpoints work in an enhanced mode.
The correspondent "FACTOV" visited the border and spoke with the long-distance fighters, who were the hostages of the situation.
Prices in the road shop-café at the point of passage "Novoazovsk" increase every day, as well as the order from the fur.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
The Customs Terminal Novoazovsk - Veselo-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, the goods are sent to the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday before midnight, and after these rules were introduced, - complains long-distance fighter Alexei Golovanev, who travels through Russia a cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been overnight in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and freight insurance payment.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is carried.
Minimum insurance - 4.5<0xE2><0x88><0x92>5 thousand rubles (about 1100<0xE2><0x88><0x92>1300 hryvnia).
Those who travel near (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a freight value of up to <0x24>50,000, pay somewhere 15,000 rubles (3,800 hryvnia) and travel.
And the rest are stuck - because no one has such much money with them!
Imagine, if the driver carries a freight of only 4,000 dollars, but to Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) to pay for the transit!
The conditions for survival at the border - no, - set by the long-distance fighters who arranged to eat near their cars.
In border shops and cafes and so always expensive, but prices like here, we never met anywhere!
The sellers pointed out and quickly screwed them: 15 hryvnia is worth a baton, seven hryvnia - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnia - a plate of soup.
And a cup of coffee.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steps, and then we go to the toilet.
Not to wash, not to shave...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife cooked everything on the road.
A week later, another long-distance fighter, Viktor Skotarenko, comforts himself.
Will my car come in a week's time?
Why do you have one and a half liters of water? - we are interested in the only border store.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, a bottle of crystal or water applied to the silver?
We have a coffee shop, not a shop.
Take it while there’s something else,” says the seller.
After the situation began to be illuminated in the media, the situation of Ukrainian drivers turned the attention of the authorities of the region.
The leadership of Amvrosiyev and Novoazovsky Rajosadministrations have been instructed to ensure that everyone who continues in a row on the Ukrainian-Russian border with drinking water, - said the acting chairman of the Donetsk Obligations Administration Sergei Dergunov.
The ambulance brigades are now in the passports.
Biotoilets will also be installed for the convenience of people.
According to the official, the problem related to the ranks will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk Obligation Administration, as of 31 October at the international passport points "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk" were 32 and 68 cars, respectively.
"Facts" will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in attempting to blackmail Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking Lithuanian and Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement was made to the agency BNS in the State Security Department of the Republic (DGB).
The information on this is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to "talk" to Lithuanian President Dali Gribauskaite and publish counterfeit documents allegedly found in the Russian Gosarkhiv, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the preparation of the information attack is carried out by the department of analysis of the public processes of administration of the administration of the President of Russia on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania several times and participated in the congress of the Lithuanian People’s Party.
Also a participant of the operation is allegedly an employee of the V. Smirnov department.
According to the intelligence service, under cover of scientific work, Smirnov regularly came to Lithuania until the end of 2012 and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smirnov is banned from entering the country.
Earlier, the President of Lithuania Gribauskaite said that she knows about the information attack on her.
In her opinion, the main reason is the successful Lithuanian presidency in the Council of the European Union and the country's "strength for energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader has never criticised the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she said that in the Kremlin, Lithuania is treated "inadequately respectful".
In addition, Gribauskaite accused the head of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, of bringing "only one demand" to Lithuania.
In September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" into Russia.
It has been reported that the quality of the product does not comply with sanitary and epidemiological standards.
At the time, the Lithuanian leader said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the country’s government should prepare a referral to the WTO.
In the United States, the school director shot teenagers.
The director of one of America’s high school teens literally led to despair.
The man, he said, was forced to take a gun and start shooting.
The incident took place in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, young bullies left the man’s house with toilet paper.
As a result, the director of the school opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the Hooligans were not on the Director's property, he was charged with assault under exacerbating circumstances.
The man was released from prison on bail of <0x24>125,000.
Shooting civilians in the U.S. is becoming a terrible habit.
Literally in the morning, a man opened fire in the center of RidgeCrost, California, right across the street.
After that, the criminal seized the hostages of two casual passers-by, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to hide.
Earlier in Newtown, Connecticut, a primary school shooting was opened.
Adam’s mother worked at school, she was a teacher.
Shot at U.S. School: 14-Year-Old Injured
Another shooting incident took place on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, too late to go to bed and arrange a mascarade for our area.
Now I'm more like a snail.
I haven’t been called to deliver candy in my apartment for the past two years and probably won’t be this year.
Statistics, however, show that I'm a white dwarf when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of <0x24>6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I’m looking forward to every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that <0x24>1.2 billion of the <0x24>6.9 billion spent will be spent on suits.
This year, at the peak of fashion, sexual uninspired items.
Women no longer have to be representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizzas, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for men, I think we’ll see a lot of zombies thanks to Walking Dead, and I’m sure the Daft Punk-style astronauts will be on our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
There's probably nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren’t the only ones.
In addition, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend <0x24>330 million this year on pet suits.
That means a lot of funny dogs-hotdogs.
When it comes to sweets, we're not going to lie.
Americans will spend <0x24>1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It’s about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, ice cream, Milk Duds candy, Twizzlers chewy candy and Clark Bar candy.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million children demanding candy that have prepared to conquer our districts.
What’s more, we’re going to buy and — we’re not going to fool ourselves — eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is candy in the form of corn grains; yet, according to the National Confectionery Association, almost <0xC2><0xA3>35 million is sold under Halloween.
That’s about 9 billion separate corn grains.
It's a mystery that I still have to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween as a house of ghosts.
They have amazing titles, such as "Horror behind the walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Wow and scream" and "Home of Shock".
What’s more, according to America Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized homes in America with ghosts generating about <0x24>500 million in revenue, as well as those amazing photos where you almost described a photo that your friend has posted on Facebook, and you can’t remove a photo, and you can’t remove it.
In conclusion, let’s talk about chickens.
Charlie Brown introduced us to Big Tiger when we were kids, and cutting out Jack's lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, what we've been doing since childhood.
Fortunately for us, baby turkey fashion only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these turkeys instead of sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about <0x24>106 million on turkeys.
Jack's lamp, which is slowly drying on your wing, probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of turkey this year.
If you want the tasks more complicated, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to cut some of their turkeys by 2032 pounds.
Estonian Ministry of Defence website recovered after attack by Ukrainian hackers
The website of the Estonian Ministry of Defence has been restored after the morning cyberattack, the ministry's press service said.
According to Deputy Chancellor of the Ministry of Defence for Information and Administrative Affairs Timer Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the site simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly arranged everything, at the moment the work of the site has been restored.
“The damage done to the ministry is minimal,” Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
“We will definitely analyze the causes of the incident and make our conclusions from it, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents,” he said.
On November 1, the Anonymous Ukraine group posted a message in which it confirmed the hacking attack on the website of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia and opposed the partnership of Ukraine and NATO.
We want the leadership of NATO to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We must not be NATO's servants.
The Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member states.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine must not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
“Hands away from Ukraine,” Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine reported that the company of the navy of the Feodosian separate battalion of the Ukrainian navy will participate in the command-staff exercises of the NATO response forces Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Due to the violence, several schools and hospitals had to be closed.
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of South Matabeleland had to be shut down because students were attacked... by goblins.
As the local elder said, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue the classes.
A tale of goblins may sound like a child’s invention for a European, but in Africa it’s quite a serious argument for closure of the school.
Adults are also afraid of dirty power.
In the summer, for example, in Zimbabwe, the hospital was closed because the medical personnel were also attacked by goblins.
Announced for the release of the Land Rover Racing Series
Inside are racing seats and six-point safety belts, as well as an internal communication system.
In addition, you can get upgraded brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and car storage between events.
Dr. Drew Bauler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally participants turning to Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try out the various disciplines of the rally in the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the harsh conditions and realities of the rally.
“We’ve been very happy to develop the Defender Challenge – it’s going to be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to participate in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian military personnel know nothing about the group "Brother Circle" - Novije Izvestia
INTERFAX.RU writes about this with a reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
“After media reports of Leps’ entry by the U.S. Treasury into the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate ‘Brother Circle’, we searched all the databases, but we did not find such a group,” the spokesman said.
According to him, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
The U.S. Treasury published on its website a list of alleged members of the “Brother Circle” criminal group.
Among them was the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He appears on the list as "Grisha", put on the eve.
They coincide with the data of the popular Russian performer.
The exact name is indicated - Grigory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another ex-Soviet, whose citizenship is not specified.
In the United States, it is believed that Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported the money for the bandits on their orders.
This message is attached with a photo of the singer and all his data that corresponds to the reality.
What’s more, Leps actually recently bought a house in Phuket.
The agency noted that it intends to impose sanctions on Leps.
The inclusion of a person on the U.S. Treasury’s blacklist will result in the blocking of his assets in the U.S. and a ban on business contacts with him by persons residing in the United States.
Lepsa's assistant Maya Serikova said that no notifications were received to the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question of whether it is Gregory, whom everyone is talking about now in connection with the US scandal."
All Leps knows is the media.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know if they exist in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all, on the one hand, ridiculous, and on the other - surprising and unexpected," she said.
According to her, Gregory Leps does not live in Phuket, but, according to the U.S. Treasury, he actually has a home on the Thai island.
She said Leps is now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news stopped him during a flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Escape to the field in the game "Shinnik"
Some details about the personality of the fan who escaped to the field during the 1/16 final of the Russian Cup between the Yaroslavsky "Shinnik" and the Moscow "Spartak" were known.
As the head of the KDC of the Russian Federation, Arthur Grigoryantz, said, referring to the data of the Ministry of the Interior, this fan is a Moscow.
He's under arrest right now.
"In addition, Grigoryanz told about how the fan managed to break into the field: "It turned out that this one, we call him a spectator, went to an ambulance with two spectators, referring to heart problems.
He came to the ambulance, which the ambulance doctor confirmed to us.
Then he pushed out two companions and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the East and South Tribe to the corner of the East and North Tribe.
He ran all over the field.
This is the responsibility of the stewards.
Before the entry into force of the sports law is the area of action of the drivers - the police cannot interfere in what is on the field.
He ran to the tribune, passing through the Eastern tribune.
And at this time, riots began on the Eastern Tribune and on the runways,” the head of the KDC said.
We remind that the decision of the KDC "Spartak" Moscow will hold the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championship against "Lokomotiv" and "Zenit", and will also pay a fine of 600,000 rubles.
Fire crews were called to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck at a height of 50 feet above the ground in a dangerous career downhill.
Ruby's Cocker Spaniel Escaped After Got A Little Dump
Three days later, she was stuck in her career, noticed the man walking the dog.
Firefighters landed on a rope on a suspended slope to save the dog from inevitable death
The puppy was fortunate to be rescued after firefighters were summoned to pick him up and deliver him to a safe place, after he somehow stuck at a height of 50 feet on a dangerous slope.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby fled after getting into a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone before being rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her owner, 25-year-old Scott Alderson, and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at Flappy's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were searching for their missing dog and posting contacts on social media sites after she ran into a career after a small accident.
At about 14:15 on Wednesday, the star dog driver noticed Ruby stuck at a height of 50 feet at the bottom of her career.
The technical rescue team from the Kleckiton fire station hurried to the scene of the accident, descended down the ropes to save Ruby, and used a carrier to lift her up on the slope.
Andy Clayton, a ambulance officer, said: “She was in a dangerous position.”
It was right in the middle of the slope – 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn’t move the muscle during the rescue, she was completely frozen.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate cakes.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is unbelievable.
Rescue officer Peter Lau said, “Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued.”
There was a possibility that she could get a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for inspection, and it was found that she was okay except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall of the Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “Watching the rescue was terrible.”
I couldn't believe she was there at all.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she had become stronger and lost consciousness, she would most likely have fallen.
The firefighters were great.
It was very brave – what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of Kitley added, “We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there.”
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a backing vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old habits die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker and noted, “He played with me when I was 18.”
She added: “It was a long time ago and he was very good.”
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old Jagger said he “categorically denies that he ever pleaded guilty to Katy Perry.”
The spokesman added, “Maybe she’s confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on this year’s Rolling Stones tour.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking up with Europe gives Scots a choice
One more day, one more fear of independence.
This time, we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition of EU membership.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with a sloping wire along the Adrianova shaft.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to possible economic benefits from more free movements across the rest of Europe, although — which is predictable — it did not appear in the headlines.
No one has pointed out that EU member states are spending a lot of time turning their formal rules the way they like it.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from the Scottish people.
So it's not worth the attention of the story.
And so old that it turned into rocky: for the first time I’ve heard “the blur” that “independence means passport control” at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment, lost in the narrative of an ancient tale.
Why, in general, should independent Scotland obey the orders of Europe?
Why change the London yacht to the Brussels yacht, especially now?
Here are the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the project "Europa" is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties against the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining power.
Even in Germany, the party of Euroskeptics "Alternative for Germany" - founded only this year - emerged from nowhere and received almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially pushing out the "Free Democrats" (Free Democrats).
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a fractured moment.
The tough savings measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the bonds imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency, led many people to think that the project "Europe" went too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are working on excessive budget deficits – that was just for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters, which German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is in a pre-existing disadvantage in terms of production capacity compared to Germany.
The only rescuing means is to cut wages and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of the budget and the currency lies a deeper problem of Europe’s productive capacities.
As a result of the “green” energy measures implemented by Brussels – a code that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the US.
This is paralyzingly unfavourable price conditions, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
No freezing of wages in the world will stop the devastating victory of the U.S. cheap sludge gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, the uprising is ripe, especially in France, the EU’s once fiercest supporter.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France’s ruined economy in a state of disaster.
The result – the right-wing anti-EU party Marine Le Pen’s National Front has just won the decisive additional elections, dropping the ruling socialist party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to British workers that it cannot be assumed that the split between the right will automatically be in favor of the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly-invented popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If – and this is very likely – anti-EU parties get support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to take the dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
This is my opinion: the soon-growing moods against the EU and against a single currency in Europe merge together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become something like a floating “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several of its dependent economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I guess the UK is moving away from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that Britain will be left unnoticed in the cold Atlantic.
In what position does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in essence) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, send Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed in the framework of a more free European agreement, provided that we preserve our currency.
Cooperation with other unified countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating Norway's experience and preserving our economic independence.
The government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is – oddly – the most successful political movement in Europe, directed against measures of hard savings, received an impressive majority of votes in 2011 due to the protests against the loopholes and the cost reductions proposed (and implemented) by the <0xD0><0x94><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB5><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB9>.
It would now be foolish for Scotland to vote for independence only in order to take the tough savings imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sexual maturation: early aging
African-American and Latin-American girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white counterparts, studies show.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturity is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe the epidemic of obesity may be one of the launching mechanisms of early sexual maturation
The tendency to early sexual maturity is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Eterge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be frightened if her daughter starts to form mammary glands and grows scalp hair at 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, children's endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and are a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents—usually it doesn’t mean a rapid onset of full sexual maturity,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, scalp and underarm hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a slight shift in the menarche age (the first menstruation) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it is at least two or three years before the menarche,” said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book “Early sexual maturation in girls: how to deal with this common problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how sexual maturation will progress.
There is a discussion about what is the actual occurrence of sexual maturity, but it is considered “premature” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – this is something that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression can serve as a basis for tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to slowing growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations on medication or hormone therapy are based on the age of the child, level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is cautious with medications, but admits that “suppression of sexual maturity can alleviate behavioral problems and girls’ feelings that they are different from their peers.”
Another big problem is understandable: parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They’re worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they’re going to deal with hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began her menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first among her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of early sexual maturation.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
In boys, as in girls, sexual maturation occurs earlier.
Caplovitz claims that the prerequisite that has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9, which links the amount of fat in the body with the periods of sexual maturation.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latin-American girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations.
Worldwide, early sexual maturation seems to affect everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys’ hair on the face and forehead appear at a younger age, the tendency to full early sexual maturation is not as pronounced as girls.
Other doctors who participated in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and scalp hair occurs even in infants and children of wedlock age.
“We need to be careful about how we determine the true occurrence of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be shy to get instructions from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This could mean a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplovitz explained.
If you keep calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who bloom early need to confirm that even when this happens before set, this process is a normal part of life.
U.S. Boeing stuck in Chitose is preparing for departure
The American plane carrying out observation flights over the territory of Russia under the Open Air Treaty and the unplanned landing on Wednesday in Chit on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 p.m. Moscow time will leave the city’s airport.
The airport's management allowed the flight on board, receiving money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other data, he is going to the United States.
The plane that flew to Ulan-Ude reportedly landed in the Zabaykal region due to the fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita Airport.
There are 30 people aboard the plane, including the crew, they spent two nights in the airport, ITAR-TASS reports.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, under the terms of the Open Air Treaty, people on board the aircraft are not entitled to go beyond the airport of Chita, they can pass border control only at two Russian airports - in Cuban and Ulan-Ude.
The Open Air Treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 States participating in it.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, countries of Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, to facilitate the monitoring of the implementation of arms control agreements, to enhance crisis prevention and crisis resolution capabilities within the OSCE and other international organizations.

Manufacturers of jets are hostile about the width of the seat when on the cone large orders
A fierce dispute broke out between the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers whose interests are not always at the centre of the airline’s attention, while the volume of flight and the range of space offered to them is the key role of the Airbus.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class salons, but its main U.S. competitor, Boeing, says it should be decided by the airline.
The dispute takes place at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sales of increasingly larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and at the event on November 17-21, potentially record orders are expected.
Composing the rear part of the aircraft — especially whether 9 or 10 people are seated in a row — is central to the economic efficiency statements of the new “mini-aerobus” projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on more than 17 inches wide seats in the economic class, placed by 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in the economy class on 18-inch wide seats, located 9 in a row.
Aircraft giants are often exchanged hits on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.
Now, Airbus is addressing the public directly before the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war might be, showing the financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant pressed against each other, titled “Would You Agree to It?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights on smaller seats than regional turboprop aircraft,” said Airbus sales manager John Leigh.
With changes in the diet, people gain weight, but the airplane seats have not changed significantly.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standards of modern long-distance travel, and by the turn of the century, the weight of an average American man aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waistband of the average 21st century American man is 39.7 inches, according to the U.S. Health Service statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average waistband of those recently called a “reactive audience” was already there.
Airbus says it has ordered a study that shows that an additional inch of seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing is skeptical of Airbus’ seat size figures and says manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines can find a balance between tariffs and conveniences.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the lounge depends not only on the width of the seat.
“In fact, it’s all about giving airlines the choice and the opportunity to do what they think they should do to achieve success,” said Kent Crawler, a Boeing salon expert.
They do not want us to decide for them what will bring them a profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is a race for orders for aircraft, estimated at least <0x24>700 billion at catalog prices in the coming decades – enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the location of the seats is precisely what warms up the rivalry in the battle between the newest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing have announced a 20 percent increase in profitability in their last two-engine long-distance models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing’s declared performance is partly based on a comparison of the 10-seater 777X series with the original 9-seater series of the 777 design solution.
Winning at a specific cost is reduced compared to the 10-seat setup currently in use.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to push more space and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our developments,” said Kevin Kennystone, Head of Airbus Passenger Comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say salons with full 10-seater rows for existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense landing that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“Eighteen-inch seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’s offer is a threat from the 777 model,” said Mary Kirby, the salon’s interior specialist, founder and editor of Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Travelling world-wide vendors of jets even take roulette with them to check competing schedules.
Cheering comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense hall layout for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with 10 seats, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus has underlined the need for additional modifications to the cabins, offering broader passages on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of major modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “fly up” but may distract from the 777X’s sales wave.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may deprive the smoking process of pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further tests are needed before human tests begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystall of Waile Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were encouraging.
“We are very hopeful that such a strategy of using the vaccine can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to help them.”
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine stroke.
In the tests, vaccinated mice, who were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And mice who were not given the vaccine “relaxed,” and this is a sign that nicotine reached their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, clots had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibodies factories.
Professor Crystall said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that further research was needed.
Oleijnikov: one-third of the rural settlements of Sub-Moscow are fully subsidized
Vice-Governor of the Moscow Subdivision, Yuri Oleinikov, said that almost a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are fully subsidized.
A total of 187 of the 288 settlements received from the region's budget.
In 2013, 187 of the 288 settlements received subsidies from the regional budget.
The individual weight of grants in the revenue of the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50% and 83 percent of grants.
Within the framework of the budget security from the regional budget is sent about 25 billion rubles," - said Oleinikov.
The Deputy Governor also noted that only in three urban settlements - Mytish, Odintsovo and Pushkino - the revenue of the budget is more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "this is completely lacking".
The cost of the maintenance of the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of Podmoskivya is more than 70%, "at the same time there is a decrease in the quality of services", said Oleinikov.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of the municipalities of Podmoskiv until the end of November to consider which settlements need to be enlarged, incorporated into urban districts or changed the system of administrative administration.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Previously, the governor of the Moscow region said that within the framework of the administrative reform in the sub-Moscow is planned to reduce the number of dotation rural settlements.
There is also a demand for enlargement of municipalities in the districts of Mozhayski, Kashirski, Solne<0xC4><0x8D>nogorski, Kolomenski, Lubertz and Kotelnik.
Discussion of this issue in cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
The President of Mosopolduma Igor Brincalov also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of Podmoskva are planned to unite as part of the upcoming Admreform.
This is due to the fact that less than one-third of the 178 rural settlements in Sub-Moscow have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 are subsidized.
Diana Arbenina celebrates Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide how much pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Despite the fact that Arbenina now spends a lot of time on creativity and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to deal with Martha and Artie, and not only spends time learning them, but also entertains as much as she can.
In the past week, Diana has reported to her fans twice about her pedagogical talents.
First, she posted a photo on Facebook that shows her how to teach children to read.
Yesterday, she asked fans, showing how she put Artem and Martha on Halloween.
Our first halloween is ready for the race on the poles," Diana called the photo of her children dressed in holiday costumes.
Which is unwise, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are relevant to this holiday since they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce "indefinite gender" when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe where it will be allowed to indicate "indefinite" when registering children born with hermaphrodites instead of male or female.
The parents of the child will have the right for a while to leave the count of "sex" in the birth certificate unfilled.
Instead of "F" (female sex) or "M" (male sex), parents can write "X" (indefinite).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to hurry with the operation to "clarify" the gender.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world are born with hermaphrodite.
Tripody denies being influenced by O'Brien
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the figurehead of the state’s anti-corruption oversight body.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripody denies changes to the lease order of coastal properties at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obed, who secretly owned three properties on state land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obede had lobbyed several state ministers to extend lease agreements on the Serquoial Ki, where the Obede family owned two restaurants and coffee shops in 2005, without passing through.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obed's secret involvement in real estate, following the testimony given by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy head of administration, Lynn Ashpool, on Thursday.
During several years of discussions, which began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put on open competition.
The tenants were against it, and also wanted longer lease periods.
In 2009, the lease agreements for the firms on the Sercuellar Ki, which brought the Obeyed family about <0x24>2.5 million a year, were extended without being exhibited for an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of open competitions.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obed, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, strongly advised to make changes to the government's lease policy.
The ICAC's decryption of telephone conversations was conducted in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obey, Mr. Tripod, and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the direction of Mr. Obey in the Department of Transportation.
"Was the issue discussed during these phone conversations a matter of developing a commercial lease policy?" asked Commissioner Anthony Willy, an assistant to the Lease Commissioner, Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripod.
I can’t remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn’t.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obey.
According to a senior official, Israeli military aircraft are attacking targets inside Syria
A senior administration official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli military aircraft struck targets in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The officer did not specify that this was the goal, but said that at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out air strikes on cargoes with rockets inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers of subclass 457 can be tested for “authenticity”
The “authenticity” test for foreign visa workers of Class 457 is under consideration by the government as it intends to extend repressive measures.
This test, if accepted, will apply to the criteria aimed at preventing the use of class 457 visas to fill unskilled positions or as a loophole for relocating family and friends to Australia.
The document submitted by the government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McCain criticized the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“The loud statements like ‘foreigners are at the end of the line’ and ‘working for Australians first’ are a very unpleasant break to times when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that had to be defended — and if some in the region had seen the angles of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The document presented for discussion outlines 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka, where he meets with officials on human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes, and the rest are in the process of being considered.
If the ‘authenticity’ criteria are accepted, the visa applicant may be investigated to determine whether the candidate is authentic in a situation where the candidate is a relative or close relative of the owner or a person related to the financing of the enterprise.
Businesses may also be required to report on the number of visa holders of subclass 457, since companies that previously intended to sponsor a small number of employees, then hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker is believed to have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The murdered nine-year-old son of the man accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father's death on Wednesday he has been supported by his cousin, who was also aboard the ship.
The Australian authorities sent the man to a hospital on the Christmas Island where he died.
A friend of Semen Varlamova said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of the hockey player Semen Varlamov, Evgeny Vavrinyuk, said that he suffers from alcoholism, the Russian News Service reports.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” the woman said.
We recall that Vavrinyuk filed a lawsuit for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian team Semen Varlamova, who is also a member of the club "Colorado".
According to her, the hockey player pulled her off her hair, as well as kicked - after the attack, her arms, chest, abdomen and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came with the guilty police of Denver and confessed in a beating, describing in detail what happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail of <0x24>5,000.
The court did not restrict the athlete in movements across the country, but prohibited approaching Vavrinyuk.
He is also threatened with imprisonment for up to six years for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at enhancing the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project will open a high-speed communication with Scotland and northern England, with the start of the First Stage in 2026.
Baroness Transport Minister Kramer noted that the project “will unite Britain.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" with the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, the lines will be set in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has ordered HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in rail capacity and a reduction in travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility to cross the route from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make the UK and its cities closer to each other.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a permeability crisis in our rail network.
But it’s also about transporting cities to each other; 18 cities across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive better communications thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alister Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called for Mr. Carmichael "unambiguously" to support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the overall argument for the high-speed railway across the UK.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the Government of the United Kingdom to consider options for the construction of the high-speed railway in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with the British ministers next year and taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Is Thorium a New Hope for Nuclear Energy?
Governments in countries around the world continue to think about how to provide for energy needs.
Burning hydrocarbons (where they are) negatively affects the climate.
Renewable energy sources require a lot of space for generation.
Atomic energy is no longer the same, but it leaves a lot of costly waste to recycle.
Recently, scientists have paid attention to Thorium - another radioactive element of Mendeleev's system.
It is found all over the world, and, as experts say, its fragmentation does not leave waste that needs to be stored for centuries.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force so far
Passengers of Australian airlines will still need to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the U.S. to soften the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch video games or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided that they will remain in the "Regime".
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision requiring U.S. airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but said they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they are considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases are still in place in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Administration currently has no special rules regulating the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” he said.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to ensure safety at all times, and passengers to comply with the safety rules reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of use on board its Wi-Fi entertainment system, was not opposed to the changes, but said it would follow the regulator’s instructions.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of the issue of the authorization of the use of electronic devices, because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it is on our aircraft,” he said.
Qantas has said it will abide by the current rules.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not plan to change it in the near future,” she said.
The FAU decree applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the FAU’s decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as revise manuals, training materials, handheld rules and instructions for passengers.
“After the airline checks and confirms the stability of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-books and smartphones, at any height,” the FA said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, as recommended by the group, heavier devices should be placed under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan sounds in the Cuban anthem notes of extremism
The football match between Anji and Cuban originated in a political clash between the Krasnodar region and Dagestan after fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Cuban anthem sounded different.
Dagestan’s head Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday invited Republican parliamentarians to go to court because the Krasnodar region’s anthem allegedly calls for inter-ethnic dissent, in particular, calls for war with the “basurmans”.
Take the anthem of Krasnodar Region, it is in our time that this anthem was approved in 1995.
It's a shame, and no one is doing it.
"Remembering you here, as a mother of the native, on the enemy, on the basurmanin we go to the death battle" - why write such words in the hymn, to feed some believers on other believers," - expressed solidarity with the President of the Parliament of Abdullah.
Putin gets impunity for his friend Assad
And now - news from overseas, namely from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel struck missiles of Russian production, which, according to reports, were intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has met an important condition - to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached under Russian mediation and which allowed the United States not to carry out a military operation, which they closely approached this summer.
More about the weapons and what all this means for the Syrian president, will tell our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from toxic gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal made by Assad’s friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
Today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had decommissioned the claimed chemical weapons factories.
A more long-term and difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components to it.
As we understand it is about a thousand tons.
Previously, Washington said Assad’s days were counted.
I think Assad should leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and has to leave.
But Assad remains.
And she feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad has avoided punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made the impression of a man ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the U.S. ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of starvation, his mother is unlikely to be easier than not being killed with chemical weapons.
Assad is still standing.
They change their weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation set up a separate Ministry of Construction and CSK
Russian President Vladimir Putin created a new ministry to cure the construction and KGB issues and proposed to lead his ex-governor of the Ivanovo region Mikhail Menu in the process of a personal meeting.
The president met with Mikhail Menem at the residence in Novo Ogarevo, and I did not refuse to head the new office.
Press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to the construction and RCMP, are being transferred to the new ministry from the Minregion.
Michael Men is the son of a well-known Orthodox priest, Proto-Priest Alexander Mena, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry named Gubkin.
Since 1995 his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergeyev-Posadsky District, was a deputy of the State Duma, the first Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of the Moscow Region, Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Meni was governor of the Ivanovo region.
Lombard owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties.
In a lombard at the Bendemir shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthaling puts a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for his daughter’s school education.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,” said Mrs. Amirthaling.
Although she earns <0x24>3,000 (<0x24>2400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family’s monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia — where household debt is growing — is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its trade, became the third lombard registered on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
A mortgage loan for jewelry is not just a quick way to get money (<0x24>1300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthhaling), but it’s almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, lombards in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% – slightly higher than 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
Lombards, however, have the advantage that they do not require credit verification or salary proof and can issue loans faster than banks.
That is why millions of people across the region are turning to lombards as families are under pressure because of rising cost of living and a rapid rise in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis, and cheap loans fueled by free monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income households are turning into low- and middle-income households that are overburdened.
This week, Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, indicated an increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to the growth of the mortgage, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list with 80% of GDP compared to 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with the rise in prices, people in the middle and lower [income scales] will look for ways to supplement their income wherever they can,” says Song Seng Wong, economist at CIMB, Malaysian bank.
The record high prices of gold in the last two years have heightened the rush with which people deposit their personal belongings as they use the opportunity to get money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items placed at the city-state’s 200 lombard points are gold items.
People say, “The price of gold looks good, let’s bet on Grandma’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
In Thailand, the largest operator of EasyMoney lombards has seen an increase in the number of customers using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the lombard business is such that ValueMax, a branch operator in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, executive director of DiktoreMax.
The company will finance the expansion, using 60 percent of the S<0x24>66 million raised this week as a result of stocks being placed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have sparked criticism because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that the lombard not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase debt directly.
“Clients lay down items they already own, and monetization of personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The institution is gaining wider public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
And at the same time, lombards are not only used by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax offices, depositing gold bars or Rolex watches that can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy people who need to borrow money in the short term for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome temporary financial difficulties,” she says.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is important to the population not the number of available medical institutions and their status, but the quality of medical care provided.
Implementation of the program "Modernization of the health care of the Tula region for 2011 - 2013", reorganization of the medical institutions of our city will allow to create an optimal structure for the provision of medical care to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant and childbirth.
Thus, after association with the hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to attract close specialists from the UGZ "NGKB" for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to carry out additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the logistical base of the orphanage was significantly improved, and modern equipment that complied with world standards appeared.
During these years, about 8 million rubles were allocated for the renovation of the premises, 112 units of equipment for the amount of 42 million rubles were purchased.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
In the operating room, during cesarean section, the "Sell-Seaver" machine is used, allowing to collect blood from the surgical wound and after special treatment to return its uterus, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
The modern equipment is also equipped with a clinical-laboratory diagnostics department.
In women's consultation, electronic registration works, in the near future the introduction of electronic cards and patient's history of disease is planned.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, the possibility of consultation of gynecological patients, pregnant women, mothers and newborns with regional specialists emerged.
Chechens beat and rob 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
The natives of Chechnya are arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been underway since March of this year.
Approximately 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes to one of the hotels in Strasbourg, and then beat and robbed them.
The head of the gang was a 27-year-old formerly convicted native of Chechnya.
Bayern defender David Alaba became Austria's best athlete in 2013, according to the Bundesliga's official website.
In this dispute he was ahead of the representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third - a ski jumper from the trampoline Gregor Schlirentzauer.
Last season, the 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian descent helped his team win in the Champions League, the Champions League and the German Cup, as well as in the UEFA Super Cup.
Arshavin's ex-wife rests with actor Andrei Chadov
Ex-civilian wife of footballer Andrei Arshavin Baranovskaya "Zenit" Peter is taking a vacation with actor Andrei Chadov.
Yulia is in Italy in the company of the actress Anastasia Zadozhnaya, her fiancee - figurist Sergei Slavov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
The photos from the couple’s shared walks were posted on Instagram by Anastasia Zadozhzhnaya.
This is not the first photo of Andrea and Julia.
On October 5, Zadorozhnaya published a photo in which the couple stands hugging on the shores of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Zenita, Andrei Arshavin, admitted that he lived separately from his civilian wife Julia.
Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
Recently it became known that Arshavin was meeting former model Alice Kasmina.
Arshavin's new girlfriend was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Rescue package of <0x24>325 million for Tasmania’s health
The federal government insists that the <0x24>325 million bailout package for Tasmania’s weakened health system will be complemented by harsh conditions that ensure the state government will not waste money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Pliebersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent measures" to prevent the crisis caused by the aging of the island's population, higher levels of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The four-year funding decision was taken after consultations by the government with independent deputy of Tasmania Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures, which we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,” Mrs. Plybersek said.
The <0x24>325 million package includes <0x24>31 million per flash campaign for planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract removal operations, will help to overcome the delay.
There is also money for clinics accepting patients without pre-registration in Hobart and London, to improve post-patient care quality, training medical professionals, mental health services, and the implementation of personal electronic medical cards systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will go to the advanced doctors’ statements to implement ideas on how to better help the health care system in Tasmania,” said Mrs. Plybersek.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmanian Government would work in a strict manner of accountability and accountability.
The State will need to maintain the current levels of funding in order to receive the Commonwealth funds and to report monthly on where it is spending those additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the staff provides services as efficient and efficient as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that <0x24>325 million will not decide anything unless they are followed by a genuine reform that will put Tasmania’s health system on a more sustainable basis.
However, he commended the Government for responding to his urgent request for assistance, with which he first appealed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly help to get this state’s health system out of a critical state,” Wilkie said.
According to the State Government, these additional selection procedures significantly offset the recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today’s statement is “a solution similar to a leukoplasty.”
“The reason we’re here is that the Labour government has pulled <0x24>430 million out of the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state government cuts almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, it is not possible to pretend that this is good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Mrs. Plyberseck to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Giome Nicholas’ screening of Denny Diderot’s novel may boast of exceptional performance and historical details, but it’s also harder to perceive than it should be.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat sent to the monastery by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty from the hands of a sadist-realist and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to the past or the sensation – and that’s the whole problem.
Due to its serious solemnity, the story risk becoming a test like a proprietor and for the audience.
Syria Has Destroyed Its Chemical Weapons, Observer Group Says
Syria has destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous gas, an international observation group said on Thursday, while fierce clashes broke out in the north of the country, near the riverbanks of one of the facilities, where, according to reports,
Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the country’s civil war almost three years ago.
The declaration of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November, established by this organization based in The Hague to destroy or “destruct” all means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms allowing chemicals to be mixed with poisonous gas and to be filled.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule that sets its goal to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles is still to begin in Damascus.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve-paralytic gas sarin.
This statement was made during the fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Sapphire, which, according to experts, is the site of chemical weapons production, as well as its warehouse, according to the UK-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights Protection.
A group of activists, which tracked the losses through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Of this number, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, the group said, 29,954 people are members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government militants and 187 are Lebanese militants in Hezbollah.
Also among the dead, as stated in the statement, were 2,202 army runners and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to a United Nations estimate of 25 July, 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought in Sapphire for several weeks against the rebels, many of whom were associated with al-Qaeda groups.
The Centre said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not bring any specific data.
The fights underlined the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, adapted to the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of a toxic arsenal, at the outset of the ongoing civil war.
The OSCE, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said its team was “now satisfied that it has checked and seen destroyed all the critical production and mixing/fueling equipment claimed by Syria.”
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned to be carried out.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspection work, visiting 21 of the 23 facilities declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OSCE said that both sites were, according to Syria’s statement, “abandoned and ... items of the chemical weapons program contained in them were moved to other reported sites that were checked.”
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the facility in Sapphire was one of two places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has unveiled a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will be approved by the OSCE Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most complex mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmet Uzumju, Director General of the Observatory Group, in a comment published by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has faced insurgents, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad government and its security forces, which are members of its Alawite sect, separating Shiite Islam.
As for other events, the head of the center, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at the air defense facility in the coastal province of Latakia in Syria.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over the conviction of the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
The remaining survivors and relatives of 202 people who died in the Bali bomb blast in 2002 reacted furiously to the verdict issued to the last of the conspirators who appeared before the court and said Umar Patek should be shot.
The man, who spent nearly 10 years running as one of the most sought after people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in creating explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He may be released for 15 years if he receives a conditional early release.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder as a result of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related allegations, including a wave of church blasts across Indonesia during the Christmas season in 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person called a "explosor" for his reputation as a craftsman of explosive devices should be sentenced to death.
The decision exacerbated the painful memories of Perth’s mother, John Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack by Patek and his associates nearly a decade ago.
Hardly holding back the tears, she said that Patek was to be sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the shooting team,” Mrs. Cortin AAP said.
“I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was put into operation in a parking garage outside the van, immediately after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where a deadly terrorist exploded a bag full of explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the terrorist attack, he fell into a coma for a month and “died” three times, being connected to the life-saving system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of the other three members of the terrorist cell "Jemaa Islamia", responsible for the bloody killings - Amrosi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
To save his life, well, there's no reason to save his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not so much.
The path is the last of the terrorists in Bali to be brought to trial.
He hid for nearly a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent showed that the intelligence data showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore ties between the terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he had no regrets at all about how much he had hurt other people.
The verdict is on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” says Mrs. Cortin.
The path may still appeal its verdict.
FAU: “Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not call from a mobile phone)”
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published by the Feverder.
But passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
How quickly such a change is being implemented will vary depending on the airline, FAO administrator Michael Warta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAU how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their training manuals for flight crew members and device layout rules in order to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already presented the plans.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” FAU said.
Currently, passengers are obliged to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft’s door is closed.
They should not re-launch them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain does not give 'good'.
Passengers should turn off their devices again when the plane is down for landing, and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference can allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, FAU said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified in such a way that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glaiding, president of the Association of Professional Board Guides, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option,” Gladding said.
We are frankly tired of feeling “working around school” when it comes to this issue.
But Internet access for surfing, emailing, texting, or uploading data will still be banned at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices into airplane mode.
Thus, there are still no "Words with Friends" - an intelligent online game, in which actor Alec Bolduin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the unfortunate case occurred: the actor was removed from the plane of American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device itself.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be put in the luggage compartment, as they can hurt someone if they are flying all over the cabin.
Calls from a mobile phone in the flight will also remain prohibited.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
FAO may lift ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Council, a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said mobile phones are still considered a risk.
“Smartphones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially create obstacles for navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCS that they can create obstacles for cell phones when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The Industry Advisory Committee, set up by FAU to examine this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on FAU to mitigate restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democrat Senator Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no sound reasons for the bans related to security.
Compliance with the restrictions is also becoming more and more difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference to navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers – high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAU as resistant to electronic interference.
The airline has been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are adapted to a wider use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, Warta said.
Today’s electronic devices typically emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book reading devices, for example, only emit minimal signals when re-listing pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices are loading or sending data.
Among those seeking to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company uploaded an entire airliner with their Kindle e-book reading devices and flew on it to check for problems, but did not detect them.
The members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices presents any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passengers Association said he considers device interference to be real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said there were only individual pilot messages confirming that the devices could create interference to aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old.
However, the committee recommended that FAU allow pilots to require passengers to disconnect devices during landings on devices in conditions of limited visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sound step towards passengers who now use a wide range of technological devices.
“We are pleased that FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Auto schools will be able to pass exams for obtaining a driver's license
The driver’s license exams will be accepted by private companies with their own computerized autodrome.
The Kommersant writes about this, referring to the government's draft regulation "On permitting to drive vehicles".
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such autodromes in Russia.
It is expected that students of such "privileged" auto schools will count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the Gosavtoinspection will monitor the submission of the exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theoretical exams and more than 20% of the campus students do not give up from the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for autodromes contained in the draft Government Decree shall enter into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for training in driving two-wheeled equipment.
As of January 1, 2015, motorcycle owners will have to pass the exam in urban traffic to obtain category A rights.
In addition, as of May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to receive Russian rights after passing the exam.
A bird, airborne to a safe place with a drilling plant in the North Sea, released back into the wild
The bird, which was airborne on the coast after being found exhausted on an oil slope in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
The water pastor was placed in a helicopter headed to Aberdeen last month, and was then discharged by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Maltreatment of Animals (SPCA) at the Alloa Rescue Center.
Center manager Colin Seddon said: “This water bucket is likely to be a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has fallen into a strong winds zone over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird has become stronger and has been able to find shelter on the oil highlands.
He added: “She was unable to take off again, so we were asked for help.”
The water bucket was healthy and in good condition by the time it was released.
Is the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives and determine what changes the UK’s well-being and jobs creators want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov has surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of businesses in the UK by size, sector and region.
The results of the survey will be surprising to many.
We have found that the overwhelming majority of companies are currently looking for export opportunities outside of Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are in stagnation.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time on the long and difficult process of reforming the confused EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be restored to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives stating that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the advantages of being in the trading zone of Europe, - even 40 percent of all major enterprises have agreed to this.
The latest and most indicative is that our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wants the UK to take a course on changing the treaty and dealing with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This result, seen among businesses of all sizes and larger business groups, shows that the business is insisting on a “significant change” that will return powers to the UK.
High rates – achieving a change in the treaty and more favourable conditions for the UK will ensure a 16 percent shift in voting to stay in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that the British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain’s EU membership.
It also shows that the business expects the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to the UK.
Better conditions for British businesses are becoming more and more necessary as the eurozone enters the path of closer economic and financial unity.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and as the results of our survey show, for businesses this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in regulatory activities in Brussels.
U.S. intelligence services listen to the Pope’s personal phone
The activities of the Vatican are under the watchful supervision of the American intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snowden’s collection show that U.S. intelligence has led to hearing all the talks of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now closely guarding Pope Francis.
His phone began to be heard before he became the head of the Vatican.
The process of election of the new pope was also under observation.
What was given special importance in the United States.
The special service was connected to the phones of the cardinals who gathered in Rome to choose the next Pope.
The phones of the residence where the members of the conclave lived were also heard.
American spies have listened to all the leading candidates for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure on it for Washington.
Panorama magazine reports that the "Great Ear of the United States" continued to intercept the talks of the prelates until the very end of the conclave on March 12.
It is claimed that since 2005 in the United States, Argentine Archbishop Bergolio has been appointed as the future Pope of Rome.
U.S. intelligence has also held talks about the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine reports that the U.S. Embassy in Rome continues to operate a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives extracting information about policies and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican has declared peacefully that he is not concerned with the American “interrogatory,” even if it happens.
The U.S. leadership has no secrets.
The snowboarder for the Olympic ticket was specially photographed
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a memorial note dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The price of the ticket is 100 rubles.
But bloggers are already actively ironizing about the memorable banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic ticket on October 30, they paid attention to the fact that the image of the snowboarder from the banknote can be found in photo banks.
In particular - in free stock stock exchange photo storage, where this photo is dated to 2005.
The same photo is used in a lesson about Photoshop, published on the Russian website "Megaobzor" on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in the advertising of RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic ticket is made in a blue-blue gamma.
On the one hand is depicted a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other - a view of the Olympic Stadium and the Bird of War.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among the students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named Repin.
The presentation noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and jumping from the trampoline, but ultimately chose snowboard, as it is a relatively young sport.
According to Izvestia, a source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the public opinion regarding the widespread distribution of the image of the snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and are now studying the situation.
But in Goznak are not too worried about the noise around the Olympic banknote.
The head of the Gosznak press service, Natalia Nikiforova, told the Izvestia that all the arguments about plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote will be turned to the right, on the photos on the net - to the left, - Nikiforova clarified.
The person in the photo session to create the ticket was taken from different points, then the final image was chosen, on it - the characteristic position of the snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to an Olympic ticket, since the artist received a salary for his work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic ticket is quite positive.
The recognizability of the image on the ticket - plus for its promotion, - believes the executive director of NP "RusBrand" Alexey Popovich.
Proving the 100% similarity of images on the ticket and in photo banks is quite difficult, so claims to challenge intellectual property on this image are unlikely to come.
For the first time, an Olympic banknote appeared in China - at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, a 10-yuan commemorative banknote was issued.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative bans have forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to them, the country’s consumption of beer will remain at its previous level next year, at best.
Businessmen were initially expected to grow.
After all, this year has been unsuccessful for them: sales have fallen by 7%.
The head of one of the country’s largest brewery companies, chairman of the Council of the Russian Brewers Association, Isaac Shepps, told about all this at the 3rd annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute “Everyday Demand Goods in Russia”, which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already declined by 18 percent, as in recent years there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewery industry in terms of production and circulation of beer - a drink with a low alcohol content, - said Scheps.
In no country in the world, there is such a strict restriction on the beer market, an unpredictable introduction of all new and new illogical prohibitions that are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewery argued that many legislative bans designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse do not have a particular impact, yet new initiatives are constantly emerging.
Most of all, beer producers hit the ban introduced from this year to sell alcohol in kiosks.
“We lost 35,000 consumers at once,” said Isaac Sheps.
Two breweries are forecasting for next year.
Optimistic is the one that Shepps spoke of: sales of the foam drink will remain at the previous level.
Pessimistic - will fall another 2-3 percent.
In order to keep their profits, businessmen are forced to move from the varieties calculated on the mass consumer to the "premium" class: beer will be less, but it will be more expensive.
In the meantime, the radical consequences of the drop in sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"According to my observations, the level of alcoholism diseases remains approximately the same," said Alexei Sotnikov, a narcologist.
Indeed, the proportion of patients who consumed surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who “subjected” to alcoholic toning drinks such as “jaguar” has grown, whereas ten years ago it was “beer” alcoholism that prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford automotive plant in Vsevolozhsk.
As they say in trade unions, all the fired have been compensated.
However, much sharper than the problems of workers, the question of reducing prom production in the region arises.
ZakSa regional deputy Alexey Etmanov said at the meeting that about 600 people were cut at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk.
According to him, this happened in September: then under the voluntary dismissal program, which was developed together with the union of the organization, about 600 people left the plant.
Workers who decided on their own will to resign were offered "golden parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the overwhelming majority have left their jobs at their own will.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think it's limited.
However, in the next two years, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programs to support regional enterprises in difficult situations," he said, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and a large reduction of jobs.
In Ford, this information is not denied or confirmed.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will definitely publish it.
Talks about the reduction of workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolo<0xC5><0xBE>ské have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company’s plans to fire 600 people became known in September.
Earlier, the factory announced a suspension of production of cars.
As a reason, the factory called the decline in demand for cars "Ford" in Russia.
According to Petrostat, at the end of the nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in Lenoblaje decreased by 5.4%.
Manufacture of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
Mobile phones can be used in the U.S. during take-off and landing of aircraft
The new rules for safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing of the aircraft have been approved in the United States, the BBC reported.
The U.S. airline is expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, with the new rules coming into effect by the end of 2013.
However, connections to the Internet for receiving and sending emails will be prohibited during flights at an altitude of less than 3 kilometers.
Due to the danger of disrupting the radio equipment of aircraft, cellular voice communications will still be banned.
Thus, airline passengers will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be obliged to check the safety of using electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile on aviation technology and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, for example, in the United States, it is also possible that current rules on the use of electronic devices in flights will be revised in the UK.
Behind the "Russian Mafia" in the United States finally established a new name - "Brother Circle"
This week, the blacklist of the "Russian Mafia" in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Treasury introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli into the “Brother Circle”.
One of the Russians was the famous singer Gregory Leps, whom the United States suspects of transporting money for members of the group.
In total, the U.S. has 22 members of the “Brother Circle” and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts have expressed doubts that such an organization actually exists.
“The announcement of the Brotherhood is more like an attempt to unite discriminated criminal groups,” said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and a professor at the University of New York.
In his opinion, "Brother Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia".
“I have not met anyone in Russia’s law enforcement or anywhere else that would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,” said Mr. Galeotti, the American Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti agrees with George Mason University Professor Liz Shelley.
“If they act together, it’s more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” the Center for Research on Corruption and Organized Crime said in a statement.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the “Brother’s Circle” would more closely unite the Russian thief in the law of Aslan Osoyan, known as Ded Hasan.
The criminal authority was murdered in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zakharia Kalashov, who supplemented the list in 2012, were closely related to Grandfather Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, became Grandfather Hassan's nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some personalities do not have anything to do with Usoyan.
In his view, they were all united by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the “Brother Circle” of Gregory Leps – the beloved singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin – attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American counterparts, in connection with which such a decision was made, why it was included in such lists, said the press secretary of the head of state, Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a Russian citizen.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected.
Gazprom chief Alexey Miller says the Bulgarian pipeline marks a new era in the gas sphere
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today a significant event took place: construction of the Bulgarian South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began,” Gazprom President Alexey Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
“South Stream” is designed to diversify Russia’s export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which contains most of Russia’s gas for Europe, raises the level of risk for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said the direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts to work in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The annual project capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning, in the Saratski district, the car driver "Peugeot" went to the encounter track on the 115 km of the Odessa-Rhine road, and collided with a bus that contained six people.
This is reported by the press service of the management of the GSHS in the Odessa region.
As a result of the accident, the 31-year-old driver of the car "Peugeot" died.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were injured and his leg was injured.
The doctors provided the woman with the first medical attention on the spot, and she refused hospitalization.
Emergency medical staff also examined all other passengers.
Rescuers with a crane lifted the bus and released the driver of the bus, whose leg was stuck in the door of the bus.

Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences before charges against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission has reported.
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with sexual crimes against children before being charged in 2011 with childcare worker Jonathan Lord in Karingbah, the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children reported.
But the commission’s opening statement said it “never had to deal with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization.”
Chief Executive Philip Haier was asked about one case when a YMCA employee was charged with crimes related to child pornography, and another case when a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his control in 1991.
Mr. Hayer told Gail Ferness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA in its introductory speech to the commission also made inaccuracies, claiming that “there were external YMCA checks that recognized that YMCA was at the forefront of child safety.”
The certificates presented to the commissions indicate that YMCA was notified that it had received the second from the end of the four possible quality audit results carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hayer, who joined YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that he and the lower management had made mistakes by hiring Lord, and was also unable to provide a clear understanding by staff of their obligations regarding reporting violations of child safety policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys during his two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hayer rejected the assumption that YMCA’s corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord’s child safety violations.
Employees testified that they observed violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, personally cared for them, put them on his knees, said he loved one of them and allowed them to play on his mobile phone.
Danielle Oxwell, who was led by Lord and asked her to train her to protect children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnett, the childcare manager of the YMCA department in Karingbah, who was “the leader of the Lothrings.”
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the staff explanations that it was uncomfortable for them to report the situation to their senior executives.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with the Lord led them away from the thought of the need to report on him.
Mr. Hayer said that he had submitted his opinion to the YMCA New South Wales Council that the lesson for the organization from the “accident with Jonathan Lord” was not “to provide information” on the part of staff, and the council agreed with it.
Mr. Hayer said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations had been made by YMCA's Director General of Child Care Liam Whitley.
He said it was meant to prevent the evidence from failing, but at the same time was “overhearted” and the decision was poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a child-safe organization while working in it, Jonathan Lord, from 2009 to 2011, said to the commission expert on child rearing, Professor Steven Smolbone of the University of Griffith.
He said there were “serious problems” when recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and controlling staff.
Hearings are postponed until December 20.
Fashion Week in São Paulo.
She is considered in her homeland not just a model, but a real star.
Despite the fact that Giselle Bündchen left her job for a while, distracted by maternity, on these days and this week in the parade she came specially.
Her many months of absence did not prevent her from retaining her place on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world’s highest-paid supermodel.
This time she participated in the "Kolcchi" brand parade.
Fashion Week Finals are usually the most interesting shows.
It's like the stylist Lino Villaventura.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of pre-a-port luxury, the modeler has been actively working in theatre and cinema, designing performances and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
Overall, more than 30,000 companies and companies involved in the textile industry and the fashion world participated in the final fashion week in São Paulo.
It is one of the most dynamically developing areas of production, employing more than 2 million Brazilians, and annual turnover reaches <0x24>50 billion.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but admits that his return is unlikely.
On the eve of an interview dedicated to the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since resigning in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided British policy discussions, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador in the Middle East's quarter.
Responding to the question of whether he would return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair, according to London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
Milan's head coach Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret over the result of nothing in the match of the 10th round of the Italian championship with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start are due to a series of injuries to the leading players.
“I’m sorry we didn’t win,” Tmw said.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't let Lazio do anything.
In the second Romans added, but in general I cannot say that we have lost concentration.
We had to win.
Last season we completed the task of getting into the Champions League.
“We’re back from the schedule now, but it’s due to a whole series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Take a look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
Experts of convoy events heading to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before taking his first steps, this little boy with his Scottish pony Toffy ran through three rounds to easily pick up the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
The inseparable pair, of the same size, was highly rated for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition held at the Sannibank equestrian centre in Radri, near Cardiff.
Going out on a general overview against the background of men and women in exquisite cat hats, he turned his hat backwards and proudly spent two years around Toffy.
The judges praised Fenton for his not-for-year-developed innate ability to deal with horses.
Toffy was highly rated for appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffy on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been dealing with a Scottish pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: “Fenton and Toffy are a great duet.”
They had a lot of opponents, but these two left with a golden cup and a rose.
It was only his second performance with Toffy, and we were all excited when he won.
Completely unfamiliar people in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abbey Valley in South Wales, walks in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said: “All the audience was shocked, and everyone was yelling at the endorsement and hugging.”
He ran along the sand along the length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did his job wonderfully.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Based on how he started, he will soon be participating in the Horse of the Year – and I’m sure he will be doing well.
The representative of this annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to deal with his ponies.”
Together they are a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and how they presented themselves on the show ring.
They assess the consistency of the pony and the breeder's performance - Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I’m sure that Fenton helped his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper's call for "reorganization" has been published
The Chinese newspaper, which published a call for the release of the accused reporter in defamation in the first ribbon, must be reorganized, the regulator said.
The New Express newspaper, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public announcement with a request for the release of the journalist Chen Youngzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing fake articles about a company with a state-owned share of property.
Now "New Express" has to go through a "complete bug fixes process", as the regulator reports.
The order for “correction of errors” came from the Guangdong administration in the area of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation found that Yangcheng Evening News Group’s New Express newspaper had published several fake reports about Zoomlion’s listed on the stock exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial board of New Express was disoriented,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said the decision was "imposed on Chen Youngzhou an administrative injunction in the form of revocation of his reporter license".
He also “advised Yangcheng Evening News Group to make full corrections to New Express and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the newspaper’s situation-related persons and immediately make changes to the executive board of New Express.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for The New Express, in which he reported financial breaches in the construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the first track, stating that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television admitting that he had published fake articles for money.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did this mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I was aware of my guilt.
After Mr. Chen's confession, New Express published an apology on the first tape, saying the newspaper had not been able to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects have made television confessions.
Experts say the practice of snipping confessions in China continues to be widespread throughout, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting authorities from compelling anyone to self-defense.
Discovered U.S.-Mexico Tunnel for Drug Traffic, Equipped with Own Railway
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. authorities have described this four-foot-wide tunnel as one of the most complex secret gestures they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, whose zigzags make up the length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with imperceptible warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were unnoticed through it, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men, who, according to law enforcement, worked as drivers, were charged with storing marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of spreading.
If convicted, they will be sentenced to 10 years in prison until life in prison.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major tunnel to be discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after harvesting marijuana in October, which put drug cartels ahead of the difficult task of delivering their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 700 yard long passage, equipped with railroads that went from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
In Belarus, pensions have increased since November.
In Belarus, pensions have increased since November of this year, according to a BELTA correspondent in the general department of pension security of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
From 1 November of this year, the average salary of the workers in the republic, applied in the previous re-calculation of pensions, will be adjusted by 5.4%, and the corresponding re-calculation of the pensions has been carried out in accordance with decree No. 14 of 2013.
As a result of the re-calculation from November, age-related pensions will increase by an average of 5.3%.
The average age pension will be Br2 million 295 thousand.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million people in the Republic.
The expenditures of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus for the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November of this year will increase by Br274.3 billion per month.
At the same time as the worker's pensions will be recalculated in November this year, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and pension supplements will be recalculated due to the increase in the budget of the living minimum on average per capita.
BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million, 47,530, which is 2.1% higher than in the period from 1 August to 31 October.
As of November 1, the minimum wage, social and pension benefits, increases and pension allowances will be increased by 2.1%, respectively.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion.-0- was laid for the payment of pensions due to increases in 2013.
British police deliver Assange’s notification of extradition
British police today issued a notification of the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they said they had handed the 40-year-old Australian “official demand to surrender” with a request to appear at the police station, adding that in case of non-compliance with this requirement, he would be further arrested.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he exhausted his opportunities under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking for political asylum in this South American country.
"Scotland-Yard has given a 40-year-old man an official request to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice," the spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of release under bail.
The embassy refused to comment on the notification to the police.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible spying charges after more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic depositions have been published on a WikiLeaks website against secrecy.
The driver who drove 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at speeds up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
The 35-year-old Andrew Howie of Tiptry, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Brantry on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to take him between his legs.
In the world court, Colchester Howe admitted the driving charge without due care and attention.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driver's license resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also obliged to pay a cost of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and an additional fee of <0xC2><0xA3>100 to assist victims of crime.
A tax for foreign property owners will lead to the London bubble bursting.
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital increase tax measure, but expects a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a non-governmental duty rate of 7% for the houses, which is worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and per year.
Currently, the housing tariff in the areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in 2012/13 fiscal year, already exceeds the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Hawthorne, Scotland, North-East Yorzapad and North-East.
Mr Cook said: “After the increase in the state duty on expensive homes and the introduction of related anti-evasion legislation, it is very difficult to assert that the taxation of expensive real estate is lowered regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal system administrator.”
“But this move could lead some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy a property in London or its current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of first-class real estate — the top 5-10% of the housing market in price — in the wealthy southwestern London belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% last year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in downtown London continued to show steady growth of 5.6% annually, but were eclipsed by the actively developing “domestic market” with a rise in prices in the southwest, in the northwest (7.4%), and in the city (6.5%).
Scientists have shed light on how the tail movements of the dog are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dogs tilt the tail to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while anxious dogs tilt the tail primarily to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog’s family may notice these subtle differences in howling the tail and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, says: “It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain are differently involved in the formation of stimulants that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other species.
He added that just like humans, the right part of the brain in dogs controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the diverse tails of other dogs, the researchers watched the animals as they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
Probably soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go in one direction, and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed dogs video with dogs — either naturalistic versions or silhouette to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw that in the rest the expressive dog moved the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog’s beating tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail leaned predominantly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog’s beating tail), their heartbeat was learned and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that the dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience, which movements they should worry about, and which ones do not.
He notes: “If there are several encounters with other dogs, and often their tailing in one direction is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say these findings can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal’s emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, an inviting scientist at the University of Bristol Veterinary School, said it was not the first study to check whether the left and right sides are important for dogs.
Last year, a team of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a satisfied dog.
And in another research at the University of Victoria, Canada, he reported: “Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail was squeezed to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming annoyed.”
He said the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
“While there is enough evidence in different mammals that two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will probably soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed in one direction, and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after its vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The headfield band was due to perform at the city’s Hydro concert venue on Friday.
However, the illness of vocalist Alex Turner forced them to postpone the show.
The statement was made after she was forced to postpone the concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “After deciding to move the show to Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical assistance, Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngitis and, unfortunately, he is unable to perform."
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show in Glasgow at Hydro will take place on November 21.
All tickets to this show remain valid.
We want to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience that has caused them.

Pope Francis will call first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will raise new cardinals to the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The cardinals are the supreme clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope – this is the prerogative of the 120 “cardinals-electors” group.
Announcing this news, Vatican press secretary Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony of the uprising in San will be held a gathering of all the present cardinals known as the Consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Consistory in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Votes said the number of cardinals voters is likely to decline by February.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as it takes to bring the number of cardinals to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
The composer will be of great importance next year because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, according to Valero.
At the moment, there is some kind of prejudice in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first elected cardinals since the formation of the Franciscan Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who have been commissioned to look for ways to reform the church.
In the past, my dad decided it all on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was “perhaps possible” that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we haven’t been in this situation before – it’s all for us for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually appointed cardinals of bishops from the great aristocracy, but Francis was "a polo of surprises - so we don't know who he will call."
GM recalls a number of new trucks in the U.S. to finish seat backs
General Motors Co. recalls nearly 19,000 brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks to address problems with manually adjusting the back seat slope, according to a notification from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday.
On some of the pickups the front seats may have a defect in the mechanism of the slope of the back.
As a result, the back of the seats do not comply with the federal safety standards of the car on the headers.
“When hitting a car in the rear, the helmet may not adequately protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” the National Traffic Safety Administration website said.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1st and September 10th.
The production of GM pickups began in June and is the most important launch of the car in serial production for the leading U.S. automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM reported to truck owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider the notification to owners in connection with a 16-day government shutdown, which reduced car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, grew by about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra.
GM’s shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday rose 1.4 percent to <0x24>37.47.
Obama's Voter's Desperation Scream
I’ve voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for change.
He says Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism to be reduced to no praise efforts.
Obstructionism cannot serve as a justification for problems with Obama’s reformed health system website, drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student of the second course of the Faculty of Medicine of Harvard University.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me during my second year of medical school and rekindle in me a sense of hope.
It’s called “Crazy for Victory,” and it’s a memoir of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I end up writing reports about my patients in the evening and lying down in bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people, and the performances could capture the spirit.
The election victory was impressive, and the leading news programs paused to understand this historic moment.
My classmates were crying out of joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists had to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama’s inauguration in 2008, his support rate was 82%.
Then I close the book.
The return to the present is a rough awakening, like a pulling out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember those days of optimism – they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Over the years since I dropped my first ballot paper, the changes have really happened.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and diverse achievements, from the adoption of a law on accessible medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the rule “Don’t ask, don’t speak” of the murder of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to advance our country: immigration reform, the choice of public health, and the closure of the Guantanamo base, among others.
But after countless times when I stood on the Obama administration side, defending it from colleagues and peers, I ended up with the explanations that I could provide.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Obstructionism of Republicans cannot explain the permission to interrogate foreign leaders or the use of drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of U.S. privacy data by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of detectives revealing the wrongful actions of the government.
He cannot explain the murder of the American citizen Anwar al-Avlaki without trial and investigation or non-compliance with the limits of state funding and expenses during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since Nixon’s administration.”
And in recent times, it cannot justify that it is not possible to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the Affordable Medical Care Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Did I have to understand at the age of 18 that leadership can contradict the political campaigns that precede it?
It is clear that the work of an electoral post is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be shaped by the opposition political party and by incidental events such as the Newtown massacre.
Nonetheless, all of the above examples show that they were largely the administration's own choice.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm for his nomination.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and ruthless alternative; it seemed that he was unable to make a decision on his own policy or views.
I believed that in my second term, Obama, freed from the pressures of future elections, justifies the hopes we have heard of for such a long time.
However, when Obama’s rating fell below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through this book became much harder.
This makes me cringe on many of the promises that have come to an end.
This week, I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton scorned Obama in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyze the causes of failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
“I want us to regain our attractiveness,” he said.
“We need to remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer says MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of childcare leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in childcare leave because his daughters may become pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining industry magnate, who has an unresolved dispute over the payment of a <0x24>6 million carbon tax, made this statement at a time when he tried to evade questions about whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer Joint Party may control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be decisive in deciding to abolish carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that the conflict of interests could only be with ministers, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally be in the benefit of political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid childcare leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they will get a leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially announced Palmer as the winner of a seat contest from the Sunshine Coast constituency of Fairfax with a 53-vote overweight after a recount of the votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the electoral voting procedure to accelerate this process.
Daughters of Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should a decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have such a system that we can come in, enter our data into the computer, vote right away and get the result at 6:30 p.m. the same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils in bulletins.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn’t like it?
Using a pencil seems strange nowadays.
The Electoral Commission is studying options for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his program included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and he would be “very serious” about his new job.
The public service involves the service of society.
“We are not seeking any rewards but the gratitude of history for the fact that in a critical moment we can serve this district,” he said.
RBS Removing Two Currency Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily removed two traders from work in its foreign exchange operations unit, according to information from two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that the global verification is being carried out by regulators on alleged manipulation of weapons.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world’s largest financial market, whose daily turnover is <0x24>5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees removed during the ongoing investigation, which is backed by a scandal related to manipulation of the LIBOR interbank rate.
Refusing to comment on the withdrawals, the bank confirmed that it was receiving requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation into this issue continues, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, informants said that RBS had delivered the records of emails and instant messages received and sent by its former trader, the UK regulator, to the Financial Supervisory Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as is known, was granted a leave from his current position as the head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardener, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was removed from work by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher's instant messaging contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to the informants.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world – the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland’s antitrust body Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are considering allegations that the bankers have entered into a conspiracy to deal with the robbery.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also started internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, they said.
Banks search for instant messages and e-mails in a few years in search of cases of offences.
The news of the verifications has haunted traders in the field of activity, which in recent years has been one of the largest sources of revenue of trading units of investment banks, which this year, however, has faced difficulties due to the fact that the low volatility of currency exchanges is possible.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the seriousness of the situation, saying that an extensive and highly liquid currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trades in the foreign exchange market, fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by the banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at no cost at all.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired one of its London Stock Exchange’s trading department’s traders this week after it caused nearly <0x24>6 million losses at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader has acted alone and that this issue has been localized,” Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court Endorses Obama’s Health Law
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama’s flagship health law is constitutional, which is a major victory for the Obama administration.
By voting 5 to 4, the judges ruled that separate provisions on patient protection and accessible health care law, requiring citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or pay a fine, are constitutional in accordance with the government’s tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four more liberal members of the court, while the judges Skalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were against.
The court also left the remaining sections of this 2700-page law in effect and further ruled that the requirement of the health law to increase compliance by states with the Medicaid program, otherwise they would lose all federal funding of the Medicaid program, is not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit for blocking the bill was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
Each of the major Republican presidential candidates was decisively opposed by the law during the 2012 primary season, including the supposed candidate Mitt Romney.
Soccer – the cause of diversity?
In the State Duma as part of the Open Tribune, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve the national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was the following: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because from this game - one scandal and diversity.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin reminded of recent events in Biryuleva and said that to reduce the "degree of tension in society" policies and the media should be correct in statements.
Probably, he meant the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the television broadcasts threatened to surround the Caucasus with a wire if there were no restrictions on fertility...
All spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion a sense of humour.
Maxim Grigoryev said that the events in Biryuleva - "a model conflict that could be predicted", but "for these questions we answer too many people and instances", and seven babysitters have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced with regard to migrants, has, in the opinion of the public, failed, and we must find our way.
The historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes on a new unified textbook of history.
"It is still necessary to create a guide on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people they live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zhuganov proposed to impose criminal responsibility for “invitations to Russia’s disintegration”: “If you say to the United States on the radio that you have to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!”
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to "ignite".
As usual, he accused journalists of bringing sick and acute national problems to a public debate: "In the dust of controversy there is little to be said!"
The leader of the faction "United Russia" Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised journalists to conclude a "chart" and agree to hold talks on the subject carefully, and then the same commitments can take on politicians as well.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order as a whole has been established, Vasilyev said.
As an example, he introduced a law that imposes on regional and municipal authorities the responsibility for international peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm for this law: it has "no clear idea of what adaptation of migrants is, about its mechanisms and boundaries.
Thus, the subjects will treat the extent of these powers differently.
In addition, municipalities do not have the personnel necessary to deal with such complex issues, there are no means, and the methodological recommendations they could use, the center does not give them...
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities, Gadjimet Safaraliev, proposed the creation of a special agency with the terrible name "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s headed a similar office, later abolished, opposed it.
It is enough to have at the federal level a special person, a "minister without a wallet", to whom you could appeal if anything.
“We’re walking around, the shells are being torn apart, it’s very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to act together against provocations, and this work should receive decent information support,” said Vsevolod Chaplin, a representative of the RPC on relations with society.
There should be no state neutrality with regard to dangerous religious ideologies, including that, in his view, should not.
Here Oleg Nilov initiated the discussion in an unexpected way: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan need to be sought, but they are pushed not on that path, not on that path," he said.
"Not that road" is the development of football: "The footballers beat the whole crowd, the flags burn, the comrades throw stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football?
There is another sport - rugby is called...
“There will be no equals in the world in this kind of sport!” – the right-hander said hotly.
No one will play rugby in the Caucasus! – immediately Mr. Zhirinovsky intervened.
You will offer them a curling!
It is necessary to know the national characteristics, it is the same as to offer the Georgian "Zaporozhets"...
In Yaroslavl wild behavior on the stands distinguished representatives of the Moscow club - during the game with the local club.
Football will be banned all over the country.
The head of the Control and Disciplinary Committee of the Russian Federation, Arthur Grigoryantz, said that Kuban was fined 500,000 rubles, reports from the House of Football correspondent "SE" Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club are applied for the burning of the flag of Dagestan by fans on the stands during the home game of the 14th round against the Anji.
There were representatives of both clubs at the meeting, a man from the RFPL.
We've been exploring all the available materials.
For the misconduct of the viewers "Cuban" is a fine of 500,000 rubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei filed patent claims against Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former patents from Nortel, filed a series of patent lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, whose price it broke at Nortel’s bankruptcy auction on Thursday.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel for <0x24>4.5 billion, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help to compare keywords of search on the Internet with their respective advertising, the claim says, which is the basis of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones running on the Android operating system from Google, which is fiercely competing with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered Nortel an initial price of <0x24>900 million for patents.
Google has raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering a total of <0x24>4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel's patent case to the Rockstar Consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for <0x24>12.5 billion, part of which was Motorola's patent library.
“Despite the unsuccessful attempt at auctioning the patents that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar demands increased damages from Google as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the claim.
Egypt's first freely elected president takes an oath
Mohammad Mursi takes an oath, but the day of his victory is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he sworn in, becoming the first freely elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black coats in a court building on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said during a ceremonial ceremony shown live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American education from the “Brothers of the Muslims,” a member of a fundamentalist group that was for most of its 84 years.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived with a small courtesy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to greet the new president, and, unlike the presidential pump of Mubarak’s time, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss its motorway along the normally bustling road connecting the city’s metropolitan center.
Although Mursi was ridiculed as a non-charismatic “back-wheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige has grown sharply since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for the Mujarat of Islamists, but also for all those who want to bring up the 2011 warrior against the end of the year.
"Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, wearing a blue business suit with a red tie, to judges in a wooden paneled room where he took an oath.
Later, Mursi went to Cairo University, where he had to give his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with the army orchestra, performing the state anthem, during which he stood on the stand "silent".
Military officer Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi was present.
His arrival was met with the slogan "Army and the People - One Hand", which scandalized hundreds of people gathered in the university's main lecture hall.
Founded in 1908 as a pilgrimage to secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a pilgrimage to Islamist student groups.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year was born, and promised to return the powers of the president, whose position was deprived by the military council, who took the case.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, and not before the parliament as it is accepted, he does the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech on Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Mechanical Engineers of the Tyumen region was held on the basis of the Yalutorovsky Automotive Plant.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of electro welded steel pipes was presented.
As told the commercial director of the company Denis Gribanov, in 2011, with the emergence of a new owner, a marketing study was conducted on the market study of the sale of steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electrowelded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment for their production.
Already this year, more than 7,000 tons of produced products have been unloaded.
Investment in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new state was launched, allowing to increase the assortment.
The plant produces both a small pipe profile, which is used for the tap-personal economy, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, as well as a large one - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the production level of 50,000 tons of products per year, which will account for about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the shift to another activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157, with plans for the purchase of new equipment - the increase in staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is undergoing retraining of personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new unit of longitudinal cutting steel thickness up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of the product, as well as another state, with the production rate of the pipe up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company will master the production of pipes that are used in the housing and utility sector.
The management of the company sets the task of closing up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in these products.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department Leonid Ostroumov, addressing the production managers, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of engineering enterprises.
This is also aimed at forms of state-sponsored industry support, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
This year it is planned to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider subsidy contracts, will accept documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of the participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the next year, the budget provides funds of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans for the acquisition of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million for energy saving programs.
Reduced to 72 million rubles of funds for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future, this form of support will cease, as the reason for its introduction was the compensation of the tax on the mining of minerals, which the oil companies paid in the regional budget.
They are not doing so at the moment and subsidies are becoming a direct cost commitment of the region.
In this regard, the Government of the region considers the direct support of industrial enterprises as a priority, not the financing of the oil industry through them.
The budget assistance will be related to investment projects that will be implemented in the production.
Many business managers have expressed concern over the upcoming situation in relation to petroleum producers.
Subsidy for the equipment they buy is a competitive advantage of the southern industry of the Tyumen region, and with its cancellation it will be difficult to compete at the price with the medium strip of Russia, where the cheaper labour force.
In addition, the question is unclear with the continuity of the new owner of TNK-VR - the company "Rosneft", which does not yet place its orders at the Tumen enterprises.
The agreement on the implementation of the Utah Project expires in 2013, and applications for its extension have not been received.
Currently, Southern companies that specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector are unable to form an order portfolio for the coming year.
The question remains whether taxes from the oil extracted in the Utah region will be paid to the region's budget or will be paid at the place of registration of the new landowner.
Tomi<0xC5><0xA1> works 240 hours for extremist role in social media
The Lenin district court sentenced Tomsk to 240 hours of compulsory work of the city's resident, who posted a video of extremist orientation on the social network, RIA Novosti said on Friday a representative of the regional court's press service.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page on a popular social network, which was included in the federal list of extremist material.
In relation to him, a criminal case was initiated under the article of the UK of the Russian Federation "Actions aimed at incitement of hatred and hostility, as well as to degrading human dignity committed in public".
"The Lenin District Court has considered the case in a special manner and has found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime by imposing a penalty of 240 hours of compulsory work," the agency's spokeswoman said.
She added that the man fully acknowledged his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a fall in the price of goods after the signing of an association with the European Union
Ukraine’s Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov is convinced that the country’s prices will fall significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with readers of his page on Facebook.
I can certainly say that the prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the free trade zone provision, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
This means that prices will also have to go down.
“This is about goods that come from EU countries,” Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be mediated.
However, there should also be no price increases.
Therefore, the messages on the billboards, which have appeared quite a lot lately in our country, that the association with the EU is a price increase, it is not quite so, or, more precisely, not so,” Azarov summarized.
Investigators check information on child abuse in Biysk
On October 29, the media published a report that the nurse of one of the kindergartens in the city of Biysk locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
Currently, investigators are clarifying all the circumstances, as well as giving a legal assessment of the actions of the kindergarten staff.
After the accusation of stupidity, Eugenia Vasilyeva conspired
Evgeny Vasilyev, who has been attracted close media attention for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous press publications on the robberies in the Ministry of Defence, as well as about her personal - the relationship with the former Minister of Defence Anatoly.
On November 1, however, the figurine of the Defence Service case violated the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: "Initially, of course, the task was just one: to extract any negative information from me about the former Minister of Defence."
There was blackmail that I had to testify, otherwise I would be put in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
We'll go to court and prove our innocence.
We are 100% sure of the victory.
At the same time, you can conclude from the interview that, perhaps, Vasilyev was the most said that she does not care about the taste.
Probably, it means the statement of the official representative of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that in the collection of paintings collected by the figurine of the case "Defence Service", there were fakes.
Among the captured property is a series of paintings that the hostess, confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the arts experts appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they have no artistic value and, simply speaking, are cheap counterfeit,” Markin said in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then they admitted that they weren’t stolen from the Ministry of Defence, but they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it’s just unspeakable,” Vasilyeva says.
At the same time, when asked if she acknowledged her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes she had been involved with, Vasilyeva said: "Of course not.
To admit nothing at all.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation, which we are talking about.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement of the Russian Federation, that Vasilyev is avoiding the study of the criminal case materials, the lawyer of the figure said that he and his client "does not allow the investigator to get acquainted with the case materials".
What was the reason for the revelations of Vasilyev under house arrest, who has not yet communicated with the press?
Perhaps how could a woman not have been able to answer the charge of bad taste?
Or are the right journalists of Komsomolka, who claimed a couple of days ago that she had “falled into an even bigger trance under house arrest” because of news of the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdyukov with his wife and his return to the family?
The famous military observer “KP” Viktor Baranets in his article “Serdukov returned to his wife?” wrote: “Followers do not rule out that after such a shock she may become more conversing on interrogations.”
Earlier, Vasilyev took on some charges of illegal sale of real estate by the Ministry of Defence.
Pre-winter trouble.
What to do in the garden before the start of frosts
Of fungicides in the fall, it is better to choose copper-containing drugs, such as 1% Bordeaux mixture or Abiga-Pick, Oxychom, Ordan, etc.
Do you think the travel agents have gone to the past thanks to the Internet?
The company Flight Centre seems to be experiencing a reverse trend.
The company has updated its full-year earnings forecast and expects record earnings from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
This travel company now expects its main full annual pre-tax profit to be from <0x24>325 to <0x24>340 million, compared to the previous forecast ranging from <0x24>305 to <0x24>315 million.
If the current guidelines are reached, this would be a 12-17 percent increase compared to a record <0x24>290.4 million profit obtained in 2011/2012.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre received 8% of revenue in the first half of the year and started the second half with good results, especially on business trips to Australia and the UK.
“For the period from the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits for our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have a record high profit for the full year before deducting interest and tax contributions,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which usually brings us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, the leisure business Flight Centre went well, while corporate customers spent less.
Her U.S. business offsets losses incurred during the seasonally weak first semester, and is expected to make a profit for the third consecutive year.
Yesterday, Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents to the mark of <0x24>38.20.
On October 31, Barnaul police discovered two playrooms.
The first one worked in the Industrial District on Vzletnaya Street.
At the time of check-in, a game was going on.
There were 24 machines in the club.
Another game club was found in the Lenin district on Anton Petrov Street.
There were 20 slot machines used here.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia on Barnaul reports that administrative materials have been drawn up under the article "Illegal organization and conduct of gambling".
The technician's been taken.
In the near future, material on these facts will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Lenin districts of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, police are searching for a criminal who has been violently arguing with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to the "New Region" in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation on the Sverdlovsk region, the day before in the Kirovsk district of the Ural capital after the extinguishing of the fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on the street of Ural, a woman was found dead
The identities of the deceased were soon established.
It turned out that these are sisters, one of them is a 44-year-old resident of Yekaterinburg, the other is a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
They took off the burning apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was under personal control by the chief police officer of the region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs bodies are developing various versions of the murder, checking the alibi of previously convicted citizens and people prone to such acts.
In addition, it is determined for what purpose the women took up the apartment, and where they lived before they did, and with whom they had a relationship.
Schools have called for more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British artistic literature from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also feature "non-programmable texts" to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to pass a separate language graduate exam, with persistent recommendations of choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due to release new English and Mathematics curricula tomorrow, the first subjects undergoing radical revision.
It will make changes to other major topics next year.
The separate regulatory body in the field of OFQUAL exams will present a revised structure of secondary school exams, with a new system of assessments and a smaller volume of coursework.
Speaking this summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that “a broad consensus has been reached that we need to reform our exam system to restore public confidence,” insisting that school exams will be “more complex, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
In comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, while students in Singapore spend about 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on mathematics schedules, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school exams in mathematics combined with an increased coefficient in the rankings table will most likely serve as an incentive for pre-school provision.
The curriculum will focus more on “real life tasks”, including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Heihe will cost tourists 2,200 rubles
From tomorrow onwards, tourists will start riding boats on airbags from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe.
For those who want to travel to China, this means extra expenses.
A ticket for a puma is traditionally much more expensive than a hot tub.
As reported in the reference service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of the regular ticket will be 2,200 rubles.
Pass through the hall of increased comfort will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, tickets did not travel this season: at the same price pumas drove tourists and last spring, and a year ago - autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rates of Russia are insufficient for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the growth rate of its GDP to be insufficient for Russia and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the conditions of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation.
We planned a 3% increase in GDP this year, perhaps even a little more.
Actually, it will be a little less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of a recession in a number of European countries as a whole, it would not seem very bad, but for us it is little, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries as in general, and in general, in order to develop, there must be a higher rate.
Now it is very important that Russian companies and Russian businesses receive normal loans at a normal price – this is the first thing that needs to be done,” the head of government said.
Pamela Anderson cuts off her cult light bead and shows her radically new short hair for the first time.
Pam's bright cuddles became famous for her role in the erotic television series "Savers of Malibu".

A trip through dirt, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend, receiving hundreds of patients.
In this West African country there are not so many doctors — only one in 5,000 people
Vote here or via your mobile device.
Dr. George Bwell is one of CNN’s top 10 characters of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to make him the Hero of the Year on CNN.
This man will get <0x24>250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, George Bwelle saw his father return to life and return to his unconscious state, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of himself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said George Bwell.
If we had the money, we would have taken it out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals for years, receiving any treatment they could get.
"It's not easy," said Bwelle.
“You can leave home at 5 a.m. and go to the hospital to be the first, but you’re not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation hasn't changed much since Father Bwell's death in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if the Cameroons could go to the doctor, many of them would not have it in their pockets.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of healthcare costs are private.
“The only problem with them is poverty,” Bwelle said.
And because of poverty, they can’t enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwell and his team of volunteers carried out 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 other people get into vans, tie medical equipment to the roofs, and go across the countryside to visit the villagers in need of help.
They are not always accompanied by luck.
Many times they had to push the cars through the rivers and dirt.
But when they come, they are met as real heroes: it’s a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms that only the locals can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a reason for the holiday, and Bwelle with his wide smile and unlimited energy is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the brigade began receiving hundreds of patients.
“We accept 500 people on every trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from all over the county within a radius of 60 kilometers of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics on the weekend provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get skulls, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – documents needed for school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the brigade performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgery usually takes place in a school building, municipality, or home; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative zone to free up space for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate operating and sanitary equipment, Bwell and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It’s an unstoppable pace, but the purpose of the brigade usually helps to support the village musicians.
“They beat the drums all night, so we wake up and keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade are sent back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students, has conducted 700 free surgeries over the past year, and they know that their help can be of enormous importance to those they are helping.
One person explained that the free surgery he received to treat the fungus will allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” the man said.
In addition to these clinical receptions on weekends and working at the hospital, surgeon Bwell also works at nights in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he said, that provides 60% of the funding of his non-profit organization; the remaining funds are covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-grade medical student at the University of Dresden in Philadelphia, a volunteer at the Bwell Group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses like O'Malley coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in carrying out his tasks, this is an opportunity to practice what they would never get at home.
“We were given the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold tools for Dr. Bwell,” O’Malley said.
As a high school student, you would never get such an opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay their own trip to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medications.
But upon their arrival in Yaoundé, their food, transportation and training pay Bwell.
"He's a hero, no doubt," O'Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, the almost constant load of work is not a difficult test.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling this promise to their father is what brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle said.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can do to help.
Snowden agrees to testify on Merkel's hearing
The member of the Bundestag, Hans-Christian Strebel, met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the interview, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the Federal Prosecutor’s Office on a possible phone hearing of the German Chancellor by U.S. intelligence agencies.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
“He made it clear,” said Hans-Christian Strebele, “that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
First, however, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. Electronic Intelligence Agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
This was reported to journalists by Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makai at a press conference following a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, according to the BELTA correspondent.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all fields and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the authorities of the two countries will provide comprehensive assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts with each other," - noted Vladimir Make.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The minister also said that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Economic Commission was held in Ankara, after which the protocol was signed.
The parties developed a roadmap of Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian Foreign Policy Office, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade-economic and energy-related and investment areas.
“The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am confident that the current protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey regard each other as reliable partners,” he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that during the negotiations, the heads of foreign policy departments of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
The trade in goods between Belarus and Turkey, according to the minister, needs to be increased and brought to the <0x24>1 billion figure.
Turkey is also an important partner in the field of investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is untapped potential in this area.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that in the future they will further strengthen and expand.
And all the necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful operation of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," - said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama Rejects His Words About Healthcare
Amid the storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday went to the spot on his frequently repeated, unambiguous promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people are being notified of termination of service from their providers, Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama falsified his initial public promise.
“Most people who have health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he called “revival in the news” about the cessation of service, Obama urged Americans receiving these notifications to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
“You’ll get more favorable conditions,” he said.
The administration said it should not surprise anyone that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the accessible health care law.
“Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve the best,” Sibelius said in a speech to the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the law on affordable medical care, said the launch of the internet-sale platform has been “horriblely bad” since October.
“I’m upset and angry just like everyone else,” she said.
I really want to restore your trust.”
Annoying Sibelius twisted the phrase caught by an on-the-spot microphone sitting behind her assistant at yesterday's hearings in the chamber after a hot debate with a member of the House of Representatives Billy Long's House of Representatives.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long urged Sibelius once again to explain why the “architect” of the Affordable Health Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to acquire the plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
The agency "Rosbalt" deprived of media status for non-censorship
On October 31, Mosgorsud decided to recognize the invalid license for the registration of the agency "Rosbalt", - writes "Lenta".
On the deprivation of the agency of media status, Roskomnadzor insisted on systematic and gross violations of the law on media.
In the process, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court deemed it possible to close the media, effectively refusing to issue counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"?
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also operates representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and operated as a federal information and analytics agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, "Rosbalt" has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications were (and are still being made) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to the power structures continued throughout the agency's existence.
In addition to the fact that "Rosbalt" had an extensive base of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions was also said that Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Cherkesov, was at the head of the project.
At the same time, the role of Chaplina in the leadership of "Rosbalt" is not entirely clear: she is most often called the "project manager".
The director general of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief - Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not figured in the ratings of the federal media - neither by quoting nor by the audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the ranking of visitability of Russian media sites according to the LiveInternet version.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are remarks about the helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group "King and the joke", the pogroms in the capital Biryuleva.
The Rosbalta conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when an amendment to the media law entered into force, which prohibited journalists from being censored.
The agency found a banned vocabulary in two published on the website of the agency of video clips ("Jigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot defiled the oil peaks").
The other sides are described differently.
Roskomnadzor on the basis of the detected video materials accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and appealed to the court with a request to remove the license from the agency.
In "Rosbalt" stated that the claims of the department are unlawful: firstly, the videos were not editorial materials, secondly, the mother words in them were masked, and, thirdly, immediately after warning the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor's claims to the World Court - and when Mosgorsud accepted Roskomnadzor's claim on 22 October 2013, the proceedings continued.
However, already 25 of the world's judges have decided not in favor of "Rosbalt": the editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each film.
Obviously, this has prevented the outcome of the hearing in Mosgorsud - if you give up the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to declare the certificate of registration of "Rosbalt" invalid, effectively depriving the agency of media status.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The agency was supported by the deputies of the State Duma (the application to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the KPRF).
The illegitimate closure of the publication was declared by the head of the Russian Union of Journalists Vsevolod Bogdanov, the president of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Human Rights Council Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even gave him some guarantees that the case will not come before the revocation of the license.
The court over "Rosbalt" showed: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be the media in Russia today - a big question.
Syria destroys chemical weapons equipment <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Syria has destroyed all claimed chemical weapons production capacities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has acknowledged.
This first phase of disarmament of Damascus was completed a day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria had to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities intended for the preparation of combat toxic substances for use, the BBC reports.
The destruction of the stocks of toxic substances or their chemical components is expected to be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, poisonous substances are currently in sealed warehouses.
International inspectors travelled to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time – to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons – and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition equipment.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent their repair.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time the OSCE and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing stocks of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by the Western intelligence services.
They will be willing to advise the inspectors of new facilities for inspection if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not fully open.
The United States believes that the shooting was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community has demanded from the Syrian leadership – in accordance with the agreement reached under the mediation of Russia – to destroy or put all the capacities to produce missiles poisoning gases and liquids and to fill the missiles with these vessels.
Now that this stage is underway, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already available to the Syrian army.
It is estimated that this arsenal could contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve-toxifying substances, skin-skinned mustard gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
To destroy it, it is necessary that the OSCE and the Syrian authorities agree on a timetable for action to begin with – two weeks is allocated.
OPCW Field Operations Chief Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors were “personally monitoring the destruction of the equipment.”
“They are now unable to carry out further production or mixing of chemical weapons,” he said.
The OSCE said inspectors had visited 21 of the 23 facilities in Syria and made sure that the mines and toxic substances were either destroyed or brought to ruin.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, the document says, but the equipment was transported from there and checked by the OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical weapons infrastructure was "especially difficult" as work had to be done in the context of the ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, the OSCE received the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said there was no time for the inspectors to celebrate it — they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented acknowledgment that U.S. espionage has gone “unprecedentedly far”
John Kerry demonstrated a softening of U.S. surveillance program protection tactics by making an unprecedented acknowledgement that in some cases, U.S. espionage has “walked unprecedentedly far.”
The secretary of state also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being “on an autopilot” at the time of Edward Snowden’s loud disclosure of the NSA’s spy activity.
These leaks of information have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open governmental conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, have actually perceived some of the things that are happening on the autopilot.
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage went too far, but stressed that no one’s rights were violated.
He said: “In some cases, it has gone unprecedentedly far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain it to the people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there are no abuses against innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted out of good motives and that his surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are ready to explode.
There is radical extremism in the world, unreasonable and full of determination to kill people, blast people and attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
“We were actually preventing aircraft crashes, explosions of buildings and killing people because we were able to learn about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will be heading to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. espionage abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of the Senate’s Subcommittee on European Affairs said.
Connecticut senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to disappointment in connection with the National Security Agency's surveillance.
“For the interests of U.S. national security, it is really important that Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said Democrat Murphy, who serves in the first term and is chairman of the Senate’s Subcommittee on International Relations.
“And I’m going to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.”
The news that the NSA has collected millions of records of telephone calls in Europe has deteriorated relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies.
Other disclosures included documents published by Snowden, indicating that the NSA was monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone, as well as the phones of about 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended the spy activity against the allies as necessary and said it was a regular case on both sides.
Against this background, Murphy said that his office was organizing a trip of members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that members of both parties and both houses would join the delegation.
The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the travel program is still in development.
While Murphy said the trip’s goal was to improve relationships, he said some degree of “hardness from the best impulses” would also be manifested.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people in what espionage programs they have been using for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence,” Murphy said.
Mr. Kerry, meanwhile, should be heading this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address the issues of hostility towards the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence.
In the new composition of public observation commissions will increase the influence of inmates
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new compositions of public observation commissions (ONK) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting option is adopted, the lobbyists of the force will increase their influence.
NGOs are public structures that control conditions of detention in detention centres.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Rozhozzaev, the tensions in the Copian colony - it is through the ONK that most of the resonant incidents behind the grid are reported.
For control of NGOs there is a struggle between human rights defenders and force lobbyists.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of NGOs, I proposed to make the selection of human rights experience a criterion.
"It was not accepted, and the lists were formed, without elaborating the criteria," - says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev - the current chairman of the Moscow Observatory Commission and the Association of Independent Observers - the all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison problems.
As a deputy of the State Duma from "Apple" he drafted a law regulating the activities of the NGO.
The OP Council should vote for the composition of NGOs in 43 regions of the country.
The 1,800 vacancies are claimed by fewer than a thousand applicants, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balcaria were unable to organise competitions due to the lack of candidates.
OP promises to organize a donation to vacancies.
ONK Moscow is one of the few commissions with the competition, despite the fact that in the new composition there will be 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borshchev, in the current composition of the capital commission 11 human rights defenders and 9 militias, and in the variant, which is in voting in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to enter the capital commission.
However, the representative of the "Fighting Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin can enter the new composition again.
He was a member of the IOC for three years, but never visited prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the military, by appointing its chairman of the NGO, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so the human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the commission.
According to them, the advancement of the force is coordinated by the member of the NGO Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the “Officials of Russia” – an organization that defends the interests of the forces.
"I don't eat babies on the ribbon," - said RBC daily Anton Tsvetkov.
He denies that he is lobbying the promotion of any lists and says he is not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opposition members.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in what list is now voting in the OP.
Publication of information is considered a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chelyabinsk NGO.
Its former leaders will be removed due to last year’s Copeia riots.
In the House of Commons, it was concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of the prisoners.
Now, the NGO Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to police.
From the new lists, the human rights defender, the chairman of the local commission, "disappeared", but one of his opponents turned out to be, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public House ruled him out for unethical behavior.
The lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions Borshev considers "the place for Copiesk".
The disclosures of Tolokonnikova’s Hope did not affect the NGO of Mordovia, which is considered “powerful”: only one human rights defender wanted to enter the new composition, and she did not even accept documents for the competition.
OP Council member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is upset by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He forwarded his position to other members of the Council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted for because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
Coordinated the compilation of the lists of NGOs by Deputy Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, who is also an employee of the Research Institute of the FSIN.
Grib told RBC daily that it does not consider it correct to divide candidates into human rights defenders and law enforcement and does not agree that the chairpersons of the commissions have sufficient powers to hinder the work of its members.
The mushrooms do not take to predict the outcome of the OP council vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended option will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian Woman Appeals for Prison in Thailand <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket for falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, filed an appeal for conviction and was released under bail.
Stevie Rochelle Beamford was initially found guilty on June 15 by the Phuket Provincial Court of false prosecution after a Thai police report that a local taxi driver carried out the attack on the night of Sunday, June 10, while two other men were killed.
However, video surveillance cameras later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police questioned Beamford for two days before admitting that she had made the story.
Before the trial she was held in the local police chambers.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in the detention center of general-purpose prisoners on the outskirts of Phuket, not in a female adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra for help for her daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the well-being of her daughter and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
“Obviously it was a worrying time, but we hope she will safely return home as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released under bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her holidays in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to a court raising her sentence of up to two years and forcing her to be imprisoned for prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michel Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its undermined tourist image, which will lead to an apology sentence.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris for a presentation of his novel "Eltisheva", translated into French.
It is his novel that became the finalist of four awards: "Clean Polish", "Russian Booker", "National bestseller" and "Big Book".
And last year the writer for this book was awarded the prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is undoubtedly a leader in the generation of current thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prosaics.
Almost every publication of his harsh, built on contemporary life material stories and stories sparked hot controversies among critics of various directions.
It can be argued that the combined articles on the prose and the publicity of Senchino, reviews of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s until the early 2010s.
In the discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial modern writers", according to critic Sergei Chuprinin, it is mostly talked about that its participants understand the word "literature", as they see the present and the future not only of our vocabulary, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow most articles and reviews from regional media and blogospheres to be included in it.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in abbreviations in the sections "Paragraphs..."
