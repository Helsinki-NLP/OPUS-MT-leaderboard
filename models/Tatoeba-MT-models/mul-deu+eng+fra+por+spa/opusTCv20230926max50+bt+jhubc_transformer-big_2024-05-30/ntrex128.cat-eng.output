Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned that they "identify them as Muppets"
Several members of the Assembly expressed their consternation over the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has arisen at the root of the plan to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all different political parties have expressed concern that this measure could become a source of mockery.
A member of the Labour party's assembly has stated that his party was concerned that MWP "remembered with Twp or Pwp".
For readers who are not Welsh: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly has commented that the whole of its party "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a conservative Welsh member has claimed that his group was "open" in front of the name change, but also commented that there is a too small difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it should be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the letter "u" in English from Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly in charge of elaborating the legal draft to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint the members of the assembly will certainly fall to the members themselves."
The Welsh Government's 2017 Law grants the Assembly of Wales all the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly for the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was decanted by "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" was the one that received broader support in the public consultation.
Apparently, the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to reach a consensus can mean a whole lot to the Assembly President, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will hold the final vote on their designation during the debate on legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country’s name
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name for the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to become part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the name change plebiscite, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing: the difficulties of the Harlem churches
“Historically, the older people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there is no one left, both of them.”
According to Adams, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
“People have a different way of socializing nowadays,” he says.
“The bars have already ceased to be that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people were going periodically.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money he gets from the sale of assets does not last as long as his leaders anticipate "and that sooner or later they return to the place where they left."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people that will be of no help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and therefore what they will do will be to accelerate the closure of all churches, since it is quite unlikely that most people who move to these condominiums will end up feeling members of these.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The White Methodist Congregation that originally existed left during the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street retailers, one of Harlem's main commercial streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's pilgrims made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they commissioned the railroad.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's church, proudly described the bell tower as "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who sounded the track in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the first track in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest track at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has sounded in St. Martin's in recent months, on the other hand, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing its concern that the diocese "pretends to transmit the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors.
A number of people have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark kills a 13-year-old child while searching for snails in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving to search for snails in California on the first day of the snail season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel at KSWB-TV in San Diego, he spent half an hour scuba diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of a boy asking for help. Then they ran with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the air.
Hammel says that first he thought it was the joy of having caught a gnat, but then he "recognized that he was screaming 'I've been bitten!
I've been stabbed!"
I had the whole clavicular striped,” Hammel observed as he reached the boy.
“Because everyone came out of the water, I shouted, ‘There’s a bull in the water!’”
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted into a severe condition.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that he was working a few weeks ago that a shark had been detected in the area, but it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities closed for 48 hours access to the beaches from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas due to the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans, heading to the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury’s has decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty products corridors in the style of large warehouses occupied with specialized employees.
These large hallways are only a part of a considerable investment in the UK beauty products market, a market that moves about <0xC2><0xA3>2800 million and continues to grow as the fashion and home products sectors stay behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country if you try it to expand it more.
Investing in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space with areas of similar brands that can be found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the relaunch phase of its range of Boutique makeup products so that most products are now suitable for vegans, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The fragrance shop will also open concessions to two Sainsbury’s stores. The first one did so last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and changing a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made big supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury’s, the stores will increasingly resemble large stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight the Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos stores to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he comments, has served to relaunch sales of livestock and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy products departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's made a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all rushed to disagree on how to divide the profits of the pharmacy chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of its 281-pharmacy business at Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
According to Sainsbury’s, Lloyds will play an important role globally, as it will expand the range of luxury skin products brands, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, comments: “We have transformed the look of our beauty products corridors to improve the face-to-face environment for our customers.
We have invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help when offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and the convenient location make us now one of the favorite destinations for beauty products and we challenge the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulls back from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons star Den Peter Jones went “furious” after television presenter Holly Willoughby made a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with Jones’ lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to dedicate himself to the household products and accessories business set Truly.
The business of these two media characters had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones angry at retiring in the last minute of the lucrative lifestyle brand joint venture to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also report big profits.
According to several sources, Jones was "furious" when the red star of television admitted, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at his empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new deals of the presenter, worth 1.5 million pounds of product, implyed that he would no longer have enough access and time for the brand to sell.
The business had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby used Instagram to announce his departure from True, Jones took a private plane to one of his holiday residences outside the UK.
According to a source: “Truly was by far Holly’s top priority.
He was destined to be his long-term future and where we would see him for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to back down left all the parties involved without a word.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there’s a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow’s headquarters ready to be sold.”
According to experts, the launch of This Morning, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and clothing for the home, and the possibility for its height.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded True together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as president last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together. In addition, Jones owns 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's I'm A Celebrity show host.
A source close to Jones commented that “we will not make any comments about his business.”
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider “a little of a president’s own” and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, mocking the voice of a newscaster:
"I haven't given up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first meeting held in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, the negotiations for denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho said on Saturday to the leaders of the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" by the US to its country's first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump’s point of view, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We are doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now we have this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: end of missile tests, help to release hostages and return home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded enclosure, we’d have about 200,” Trump said, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds dead as a result of a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations from other countries were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is very demanding," said Subung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it’s not safe even if foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies were allowed to contribute when offering assistance.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not frequent on other coasts.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, although there was a warning in force, is likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge number of islands of Indonesia is, at best, a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was trapped in Lombok to care for the victims of the quake is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia’s underground infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko’s government is faced with the next year’s re-election loaded with funding deficits.
Joko also faces pressure from the country’s permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative kairi faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced people are the result of fighting on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores the fourth goal with a long shot ahead of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with his goal scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goalkeeper when his team was losing 1-0.
He accommodated the ball to the left before letting go an incredible shot aimed at the second pole.
The shot crossed the entire area with a large elevation as it was propulsed towards the right side of the gateway.
The ball finally started the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanté coming, I did a touch and didn't think much about it, I just dedicated myself to the teacher."
Chelsea won 1-0 at rest after scoring a goal in the 25th minute with their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the playoffs, Blue's forward returned a pass to Mateo Kovacic from the squad before kicking off from almost the middle of the field and pushing towards the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from midfield.
Afterwards, he made a magnificent deep pass, leaving Hazard inside the area with the controlled ball.
Hazard overtook the defense to finish second with a left leg shot where Liverpool goaltender Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group stage next Wednesday at 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for their part, will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped between the rune of demolished buildings because of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to a spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.

The Cromwell statue of the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
Its disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction in the purest style of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and an "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of Westminster Palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps it would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his forefather that he did during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of being commemorated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than not now, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes a fully accurate representation remains a subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.”
A killer pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local sources said.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead with a carved artery and all covered in blood near a pork court in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs at a farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had travelled Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door giving to a nearby pig farm.
According to him, there was a large male pig in the court with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg garrison had wounded the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs shattered and full of blood," said the cousin, nicknamed "Wu", according to Guiyang's evening news.
Scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market managers commented on the evening news that the pig remained closed and isolated in order to prevent anyone from being attacked while the police gathered the evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to reports, Yuan’s family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although very rare, cases of pigs that attack humans have previously been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300 kg pig caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal.
After an Oregon ranch was devoured by its pigs in 2012, a Manitoba ranch told CBC news that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "deceiving."
"They like to play.
They are like children, they have a lot of curiosity... they don't have the idea of hurting.
We just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rain throughout the southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa will bring torrential rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States over the next few days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, typical of a Category 1 hurricane at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, U.S. Eastern Time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving east towards the U.S. west coast. As the Rose approaches the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong U.S. wetland in the north.
The Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rainfall throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation indices close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a possibility that rivers form, since the situation is getting worse very quickly due to the dispersed character of tropical rains.
It is totally disrespectful to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential rains could cause the gorges to turn into uncontrolled rivers. In addition, storms can bring windmills and dust clouds to concrete points.
The depression that is approaching will bring torrential rains at certain points on the southern coast of California.
It is possible that total precipitation above 50 mm is recorded, which could result in smaller waste streams and slippery paths.
This is the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
They will begin to arrive insulated tropical rainstorms in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before rain becomes more widespread between Monday and Tuesday night.
Torrential rains spread to the region of the Four Cantons on Tuesday and will continue throughout Wednesday.
In October, there will be several significant temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can occasionally cause drastic temperature changes at a short distance.
The central region of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected to begin in October with heat in much of the central and eastern U.S. area, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the South Plane area to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, representing about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there are many chances that temperatures will be recorded above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million viewers on Thursday saw the passionate testimony of Supreme Court member candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting Friday's regular schedule due to a last-minute turn of events: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of charges for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate Committee for Judicial Affairs that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take off her clothes at an institute party.
Kavanaugh, in an extolled testimony, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers are likely to have seen this testimonial on Friday.
The company had average viewers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience numbers were not immediately available for other channels that relayed the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen tends to have trouble calculating the people who see it from his office.
Set in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of a game of American football playoffs or that of the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most audience-oriented chain, with an average of 5.69 million viewers over the entire day, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS earned 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
The interest remains high after the testimonial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was incredulous by protesters when he was trying to climb an elevator to go to a court case hearing.
Flake stayed for several minutes with his eyes wide open as he was broadcast live on CNN.
“Here I am, in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said, ‘You have power, while there are so many women who don’t have it!’”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, commented that he would have more to say in the committee's view.
Within a few hours, all cable and broadcasting chains were already retransmitting live when the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote on whether or not Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Senate’s plenary to submit it to a vote.
Flake said, on the other hand, that he would only do so by understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the face-to-face nominee next week, a condition demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had an influence, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “playing politics” in connection with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those criticizing her plans to abandon the European Union of “playing politics” with the future of the UK and of disregarding national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, in addition to May’s coverage of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, claiming that the proposal that the UK and the EU collect each other’s taxes is “absurd.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU team player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was a member of the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison for second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and claimed they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to CBS WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted that Wayde had died of a gunshot, according to police.
His bail has been set at <0x24>350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge District Forensic Office published a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of the death was a gunshot wound to the head towards the neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police fugitive operative group, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for the help provided in the investigation that culminated in this detention.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the area’s law enforcement for his “diligence and for seeking justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
On average 1.98 m, he played as an aller and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to leave last season.
On Friday morning, LSU team basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "depleted" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow".
“Things like this are the things that make you suffer at all times,” Wade said.
A volcano sparks ashes in Mexico City
The ash exploded by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern corners of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in a 24-hour period.

Police confront Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were detained in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favor of independence clashed with anti-government police and thousands joined opposition protests to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of independentist individuals detained by the anti-smuggling police began to throw eggs and paint in dust, causing the appearance of dark dust clouds in the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later on the same day, there were battering with the police, who used their pores to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independentist groups sang “Don’t forget, don’t forgive” face-to-face with unionist protesters who shouted “Long life in Spain”.
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, local sources said.
Tensions have not decreased in this region of independentist mentality a year after a referendum held on 1 October considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by the Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a vast majority, although the participation rate was low, given that opponents of the secession boycotted the vote by a majority.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting entering electoral colleges across the region, which provoked violent clashes.
Independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independentist demonstration along with his wife, said he no longer had much hope about the possibilities for Catalonia to achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of the best times.
“I saw my parents cry with joy for being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although by little margin, in the autonomous elections last December, the independentist parties of Catalonia have suffered to keep the impetus this year, given that many of their main leaders are in a self-imposed exile or detained by the later party in anticipation of the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the police support demonstration with his phone, and says the conflict has been seized by politicians from both sides.
“The tension only increases,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since late last year, announced he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Presenting yourself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the backwardness in democratic values and the repression we have seen on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Homes Arrested After Firing a House With a Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly raided a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the same building were damaged.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone has fired a balloon against the car.
A game of Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston meant victory
Livingston, who had risen to the category this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in what is just Steven Gerrard’s second defeat in 18 games as Ibrox’s club coach.
Dolly Menga's play marked the difference, as with this victory, Gary Holt's team climb to second place, which they share with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's, on the other hand, continue without winning away from home in the Premiership this season. Next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they are separated by an eight-point difference.
But before that, the Rangers will receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends to six games his invictus in the league, with a Holt as a coach who still does not know what the defeat has been since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of visitors’ direct game
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the goalkeeper long before the goal, as his direct game caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson paved the way between the defense, but wasted his chance when he found himself in front of the gate. Then, Alan Lithgow sent the ball out stretching out to try to finish Craig Halkett's lead pass, which crossed the gate.
The locals were already happy to let the Rangers approach their area, as they knew that they could put visitors in trouble in isolated plays.
And that’s how this decisive goal came about.
The referee clinched a gap against the interests of the Rangers and Livingston made an opening towards the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could touch it first and finish from the central part of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the possession, but he met with an impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the game.
The scene repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a merit stop.
For his part, Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor paused on one occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up distracted by another combination play of Livingston.
The Rangers were dedicated to hanging once and another driver in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, they claimed two penalties, one for Halkett's alleged entry to substitute Glenn Middleton, and the other by hand. Both were dismissed.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
One man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His style of play and staff have barely changed since his return to the highest category, although much of the merit has to be attributed to Holt for the way the team has galvanized since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be hanging out with Menga throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments displayed with Gerrard as a coach, they definitely didn’t know how to keep the level.
They didn’t know how to create occasions (only once they clearly surpassed the local defense), and that the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table, should be taken as a warning.
Reception for Erdogan in Cologne
They were all smiling and clear on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan later moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
Police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around it to see its president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan, many of them Kurds, were also heard as they condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinions around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled a dictator by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies in collision with a car
A cyclist has died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although the paramedics were taking care of the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a crash in Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said their agents were working to identify the man and report the incidents to closest relatives.
The street has been cut off and deviations have been applied for bus routes. In addition, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Injured in Altercat
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation in this high-security prison center, according to the center's office.
The incident occurred in Long Lartin, Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and is still ongoing.
Specialised "turned" agents moved to the site of the events to end the altercation, in which eight prisoners were seen involved. The avalanche was able to be contained by one side.
Agents had to be detained for mild injuries to the face instead of the facts.
A prison service spokesman said: “We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to try to resolve an incident in Long Martin prison, which is still ongoing.
Six employees had to be treated with injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to report to the police and may have to spend even more time in the jail."
The Long Lartin Penitentiary Center has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was learned that the head of the prison had to be admitted to a hospital after being attacked by a detainee.
In addition, in October last year, anti-aircraft agents made an appearance in the prison to fix a serious altercation in which center staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major floods (dry areas could be benefited)
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen early next week when what remains of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwestern desert, with the resulting risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rift alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that the Rosa will arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and that it will approach on Monday night with rain.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix commented in a pilgrimage that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or depression in a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was 64 km from the Arizona border.
The most recent models of the national hurricane center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where up to 150 mm would be recorded in the Mogollon d'Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Grand Conca, could record from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa could become very good news, as the region suffers a severe drought.
Although floods are a serious cause of concern, some of the precipitation could be very beneficial, as the southwestern region currently suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. drought control service, more than 40% of the state of Arizona suffers at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reports.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have hurricane force on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes me lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to touch land in Mexico with a tropical storm force in the afternoon or Monday evening.
Precipitations in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "total rain is expected from 75 to 150 mm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm."
After that, the Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and arrive in southern Utah by sea at night.
“The main risk we expect from the Rosa or what remains of it are very strong precipitations in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States,” according to the National Hurricane Center.
Rains are expected to cause dangerous floods and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Detained for Attempt to Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he is "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were detained the following day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have made a call so that anyone who can have some kind of record of the events with the mobile phone can get in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered from the mosque and anger" of the Democratic party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rejection of the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump decreed in an electoral act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “sickness and anger” from the Democratic party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh pleaded before Congress on Thursday, denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexually abusing her decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also said in a statement in relation to his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that, on that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality and courage."
“The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an admirable trajectory of service to the citizenry,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as he talked about the importance of the Republican voter participation index in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn’t run, but in reality I did,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting everywhere for our great candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicated to “resisting and obstructing.”
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place by very late Friday, a Republican party leader’s assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, and many have been dragged by giant waves that shook the beaches, as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami that affected Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast at night, dragging many of the people to death and tearing down everything they could find on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities at the beach and did not run immediately. That's why they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency BNPB in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it crushed everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved by open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There were people who climbed up a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency where the number of shops and buildings is appreciated, twisted and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched over Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical features of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found trapped between the ruined buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost.
According to Nugroho, the deaths and damages could increase to about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closest to the epicenter of the quake.
The communications “were completely paralysed and therefore no information was received” from Donggala, Nugroho says.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end up much worse,” he said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although agents said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a video of an amateur shared on social media, you can feel like a man on the top floor of a building gives desperate screams of warning to people on the street about the upcoming tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water explodes on the edge of the sea, taking buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut in electricity supply that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, the evacuees still desperately need food, in addition to other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely and safely in the city of Palu, where the employees lodge in canvas shelters installed in the yard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, Doseba says.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It is a disaster.
Although aid groups made the deplorable gesture of initiating relief tasks, some people complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, provisions and staffing abroad can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘Well, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start asking for international assistance, but that level has not yet been declared.”
While she was crying on her second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, the friends and relatives of the missing people maintained the hope that the miracle would occur and their loved ones would evade the devastating story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was rescued trapped in a locksmith.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the runway for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa hotel’s collapse among the paraglider community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a grey verification mark instead of a blue double mark.
“I think that means that the messages weren’t received,” he added.
Thieves earn <0x24>26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated in the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man "shocked up running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: “Being formally known as Kanye West.”
A long time ago, 41-year-old West was mutinyed by the nickname Ye, and used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurs before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the program's author.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think you're the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," West said earlier this year, as he talked about the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the only, to simply Ye, that's a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of what we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, has earned his nickname with or without a script and in majuscules.
The President of Mexico, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
The president-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when little is left for the country to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a cruel retaliation against students.
López Obrador on Saturday promised in Tlatelolco Square that “military force would never be used again to repress the Mexican people.”
On 2 October 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and killed 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were ravaging across Latin America.
López Obrador, who has committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He has stated that disability and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funds allocated to AI
“While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money spent on research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence professional who has worked for Apple and Microsoft.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government announced measures on AI, despite a general lack of formal AI strategy in the country.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the world’s No. 1 in innovation in AI by 2030.
“Duplicating the budget for AI research would be a good start, as the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the upcoming advances in AI,” Lee said.
“Duplicating funding could double the opportunities for the U.S. to achieve the next big AI discovery,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book entitled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of China’s leading AI companies.
In 1980, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an AI system that surpassed Othello's top-ranked American player and subsequently served as executive at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee positively valued previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next would take place in order to identify the next visionaries.
“Often, American researchers have to work hard to get public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, “It’s not China that takes the academic leaders; it’s the companies.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university eminents to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that the U.S. task in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
“I think that permanent residency cards should be offered automatically to IA doctoral students,” he added.
In July 2017, the China State Council presented its state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
“The National Natural Science Foundation of China grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Science Foundation and other U.S. public bodies donate money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, designed to involve industrial and academic institutions contributors, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently spends more than <0x24>100 million a year on AI research.
In the meantime, no measures have been taken in relation to U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold referendum to decide whether to change country name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the name change to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia’s applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim of its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slav majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not take part in the referendum, and a boycott campaign raises doubts as to whether the minimum required participation of 50% will be reached for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum paper is: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created after the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to agencies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely in the empire of the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have expressed that they will watch the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the Macedonian referendum on the country's name change, which opened the way for Macedonia to join the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the stores installed by people who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to it with the head high, not by the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says the NATO integration will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
Zaev stated that a “yes” would mean “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another survey, led by the Macedonian chain Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus a vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first time for the pro-Western government’s policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero scores a goal after regateing all of Brighton’s defenses
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory in the match played at Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) last Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal at the 65th minute in a game that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran at speed between three defenses of Brighton, racing with what was coming out to him on the pitch.
Afterwards, Agüero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He regained a defense before overcoming a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass on his left that he found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, to Agüero, who with his right leg hit Brighton's goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that stuck inside the net on the right side.
"Agüero has problems on his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We decided to play for between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League fight.
His goal reached the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball in depth in the field of Brighton and
He made a lovely pass in space for the left wing towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long pole.
The forward of the Sky Blues finished the ball inside the net before leaving the bottom line.
The City faced Hoffenheim on Tuesday in the Champions League group stage game, at 18:55 h, at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off struggle, there were not many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, who is very competitive, hopes to get out on the pitcher slope next Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have a chance to play-off.
The Rockies secured a draw with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to win their first division title.
“Although we don’t play at all, at least we can get out there knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably play every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
“Why would I want to lose this game?”
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but they are apparently determined to let Scherzer run if this situation is given.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a warm-up session on Thursday and would launch Sunday, on his usual rest day.
Washington's right-wing shooter has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike eliminations in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we do is at stake in November.
We have five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big.. I don’t present myself, but in reality I do. That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, their messiness, their bad intention is seen.
They don't care who harms, over who they have to pass to gain power and control. That's what they want: power and control. But we won't give them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to “resist and obstruct.”
“And this can be seen in the last four days,” he rebuffed, and called the Democrats “enraged, messy, dirty and fake.”
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which provoked strong public writing.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no. Wait a minute... This was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse party.
He is intolerant of those who say what he thinks.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
In the end, I am the last of a series of British parliamentarians who have been told we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she protested with determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censorship, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, there are similar issues with respect to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice of the Friday meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour parliamentary, the General Committee meetings held on Friday night have been exactly the same.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and long ago the promise of “more generous and kind” policies has been forgotten, if ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a seemingly political vision expected me to make a 180-degree turn and take positions he would never have taken, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made for my nomination not to be renewed, center policies are denounced and I am told that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the messages I receive are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who are faced with a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and do not drop.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of “not trusting” or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes more strenuous.
In the last two years I have received a lot of advice and I have been advised to keep my head down, not to be so expressive and “everything will be fine”.
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, stimulated by the negligent government of Thatcher, which left all my class literally sunk, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as a local government minister or as a local government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will harm our homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I want to convey is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of no renewal of my nomination or political interest will prevent you from acting, in my interest, in my interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayrs head the leader
Two last-minute trials distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs deserved the victory in this vibrant Tennent's Premiership day game.
The Ayrs, who are the only undisputed team of the ten, occupy the first place in the ranking table.
In the end, the local team was imposing thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew they took better advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
“The games we’ve played so far have tested us and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to the Ayrs, they have taken advantage of the occasions better than us.”
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put ahead of the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, ceded for the game by the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot did not score a score.
Climo expanded the Ayr's advantage with a penalty and, just in the middle, scored and converted a test to put the Ayr's score 17-5 at rest.
But the Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Afterwards, the game was interrupted for a long time due to the severe injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired in bed, and at the dam the Ayrs again widened the distance with a rehearsal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Subsequently, Deputy Captain Blair Macpherson was cautioned with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of another man with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a scoring at Climo without a ball, since the penalty alignment, MacPherson scored a counter-assay behind the penetrating Ayr mole.
Climo scored, as he had done almost again since the relegation, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to the third line to Gregor Henry to score the local team's fifth test.
Still Game star appears to be ready to start a new career in the restoration industry
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, appears to be ready to move into the hospitality sector after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The actor, 56, plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his longtime comic partner.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "flowering restoration sector".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, without coast, expects court to reopen the road to the Pacific
The sailors patrolled for their fleet covered with sharks in La Paz.
The public buildings onegene a blue-sea flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are stamped with the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Across Bolivia's coastless territory, the record of a lost coast in a crude resource conflict in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the desire to resettle the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, let’s not say it, expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the resolution of the TIJ on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will dictate in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the concession of a sovereign outlet to the sea for Bolín.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes set in Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that if it does, things will not change much.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The resolution of the IJT, which comes only six months after the final allegations were made, indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a retreat in the last four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea,” said Zarate.
“The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile,” he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold talks after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, Bolivia’s representative to The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was exceptionally quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political crossroads.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not remove nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly last Saturday.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is chimera to think that the continued sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration that puts an end to the Korean War can make North Korea ever kneel.
Washington is desperate to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not make major disarmament moves.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is taking seriously the issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of large bars, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your collection of bars or want to completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented at the crossroads a range of extravagant bars of disproportionate dimensions from their SS19 collection, which illuminated the style defined at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been seen scrapped by very impractical bars, and these designers have brought their surprising creations to the forefront.
The highlight of Valentino was an exaggerated beige barrel, adorned with a wide wing, pen-shaped, flooding the heads of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were chewed cinders, a witch bart and even a pine, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of stragglers, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of vivid colors, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than not of high seam.
One creation resembled a complete submarine team, with tubes and glasses, while another resembled an ice cone.
And if you follow the big trends in fashion, you’re lucky.
Style observers predict that huge bars could be deployed on the main streets near you.
The large bars climb the heels of the “Bomba”, a large two-legged bar with a wide wing, which everyone has carried, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the barnet so impractical that it spread through social networks brought another great creation to the hallway: a ball bag for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed with a bathing suit that carried it.
The raffia bag, dark orange, decorated with raffia scissors and finished with a white leather napkin, was the highlight of Jacquemus’s La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing people carrying large bars and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a shame to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a trajectory of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer a service of the highest level to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages are still a very popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are leading the rankings with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages received the A-higher grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, remain in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Competence Commission revealed that of the reasons employers gave to the fact that it cost them to cover the vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of linguistic skills.
Therefore, linguistic skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
As there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these competencies are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the race a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this one.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov of over 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children the best chances of finding an important job.
In Scotland, there is diversity between schools in terms of the languages they are taught.
Some schools focus more on the more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are thought to be more important for the UK in the future, by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, you will always be able to choose from a number of languages in independent schools, which have specialist teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In today’s global commercial environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered “international communicative competences”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play his first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But we still have to determine the minutes we will play.
“They’ll be more than one and less than 48,” Walton told the Lakers.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers journalist, tweeted that James will probably play for a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-match pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five scheduled meetings for next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacancy is pending, Trump claims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s West Virginia rally can be seen online at the link specified below, via live video streaming via YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing started this week with nominee in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was strained over the sexual abuse allegations he faces, while the Senate’s planned confirmation vote remains pending for up to a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this wave of rallying is to help Republicans who present themselves in the delicate November elections to gain momentum.
Thus, the five Trump campaign rallyes scheduled for next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and sympathizers, while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, while we are heading towards a busy campaign season,” a Trump spokesman said in a statement.
This evening’s rally, scheduled at Wesbanko Arena, Wheeling, could gather supporters “from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
It will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team showcases its ambition to keep hopes alive for Sunday’s individual matches
After three uneven sessions, Saturday afternoon supplies were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamics is an invented sporting concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this one.
So on what side is the positive dynamic now?
“They had a six-point advantage and now it’s four, so I think we’re in a small positive streak,” said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little bit in his favor and have many reasons to be excited, largely because of the shape state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal since tee to green and is giving an example.
The gutural cries of celebration rose as he continued his lap and became a crucial pussy to kick the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the game at hole 15 with a similar scream, indicating that he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
“You have to do your best and worry about your own party,” Spieth pointed out.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to leave footprints.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup sensation.
The strange but adorable European couple wear four out of four and do not make mistakes.
“Moliwood” were the only couple who did not make a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the crazy Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Because of this result and the way his energy seems to flow to and from the public bullying, it is reaffirmed that it is the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both in different holes at the same time.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, who was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes plunged the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole from which they had never had a choice to get out.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Furnaces and forks are very fascinating to see for the interactions between pairings, the tips they give and the ones they don’t, and the way a strategy can change over and over again.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the U.S., had questioned.
Europe reaches the final of the Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing Saturday's fourballs and fours with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The duo inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave his record, so far, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to retain the trophy he lost two years ago to Hazeltine, dominated a poorly scored American team in the morning fourballs and placed the series in 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance to the Foursomes and won two games, but were unable to reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known by the nickname of "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple to win four points in their first four games in the history of the R.
After slapping Woods and Patrick Reed to the four-balls, they scored a brilliant performance to beat a disinflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had split into two matches on Saturday, showed sporadic spurts of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourballs, rematched with Henrik Stenson on the fours and fell 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have it all in a pleasant and windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They scored a 2-to-1 victory against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and, later, won Poulter and Rory McIlroy again by 4-to-3 in the fours, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team had scored a four-point difference in individual matches, although the team of Furyk, a defender of the title, only needs to empathize to preserve it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems like a Sunday counterattack coming is out of reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm itself “in any way” if no signs of trust are appreciated
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were intensifying its distrust of the United States and that, in such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally remove its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing centre and committing to not proliferating nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not observe any response in consonance with the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament unilaterally in any way.”
Although Ri resumed North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase-by-phase” denuclearization approach by which North Korea would be rewarded as it gradually took action, his statements appeared significant because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a US president in office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump promised North Korea’s security guarantees.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has reported that Pyongyang must first remove its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that denuclearization must first occur and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, in addition to opposing the “declaration of end of war,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are intensifying our distrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If the part involved in the denuclearization issue was South Korea rather than the US,” the denuclearization of the Hawai<0xCA><0xBB>i peninsula does not take place on the Corea peninsula.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump called Kim "Rocket Man" in his Missile Missile.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still much to do and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue energetic and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously pushed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then announced he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying advances had been made, but after a few hours North Korea accused him of making “proper demands from a gangster.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “consistent measures.”
He said Kim had informed him that the "consistent measures" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course on Relaxing Habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture, to study throughout the night, stimulated by caffeine.
An academic noted that often students at the world’s number one university are distracted by the basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a lecture on the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said, ‘Why are you telling me all this now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, implemented for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts about how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, bamboo and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how it affects sports performance in lack of sleep, and about the importance of maintaining a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to stay awake all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure that students suffer make sleep deprivation an ever-increasing problem.
Ensure that enjoying a good quality sleep for enough time should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in annoying mode and makes them constantly studying.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course across the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask graduate students to undertake a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the rhythm of the problem.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's home that involves another knocked out.
The Ibrox team wanted to add their first home win since last February's 4-to-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted a second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team at the derive, at 8 points Premiership, and Hearts.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the half, and it never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equal the score.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, the Livingston rise to third place, behind the Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers could face further difficulties later, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that was apparently launched from the gradient.
Gerrard made eight changes to the alignment that squandered the Ayrs in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same eleven titles that he scored a point against the Hearts last week. Surely, he felt satisfied with the way his well-organized team suffocated his rivals at all times.
Although the Rangers dominated the possession, the Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the two minutes of the match, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder turned away and missed the big occasion.
A heavy lack of Keaghan Jacobs hit Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive companion Alan Lithgow only made a deflected shot at the rear pole.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their third-final game.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty at the 15-minute sign, as he and Steven Lawless hit, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only scored two shots in the first half, but the first Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head-shoot and the front-runner Ovie Ejaria.
While the Livi’s first act in the 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserve it only for their efforts.
Again, the Rangers couldn't break Jacobs' hard-working play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard took a break from changing Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change had a practically immediate impact, as the extreme made a pass at Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran into the blockade.
However, the Livingston continued to capture the attention of the visitors playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one behind the other.
Holt's band may have given up the lead in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow made a deflected shot from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still demanded a last penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made his eyes big.
Almanac: the inventor of Counter Geiger
And now a page of the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave rise to the device known as the "Geiger Counter".
Counter Geiger, who has been a pillar of science ever since, also became a stack of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, a seemingly unsuccessful physicists:
Man: "What's that in between?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that emanate from radioactivity to the minerals.”
Evans: "Sure it's exploding now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” and Eliminate Malignant Cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer she had suffered for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2), and subsequently re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, “The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein "provides the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” to these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got stuck in a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA hat after his performance on the SNL program.
It won't end well
Kanye West was written to the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would run for president in the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again hat, he began criticizing Democrats and reiterating his support for Trump.
“Whenever I talk to white people, they say to me, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee for sexual assault allegations filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not aired, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's disapproval to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated between the frames because of the hat he wore.
“They threatened me in the backyard.
They told me not to go out with that hat.
He is an asset.
And then they say I’m in a lower position,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said that the Superman layer would be laid so they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked the public’s writings at least twice and the program’s team members seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, who had a reporter who explained to the publication: “The whole studio was completely silent.”
West was taken as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former rapper Mac Miller had been dead for a few days.
West left much of the audience perplexed with the interpretation of Perrier's I Love It song, disguised as a bottle.
West got the support of the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR DISCOVERING IN MULTITUD."
But the speaker of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply “being who it is and that it is absolutely wonderful.”
“But I have chosen not to reward someone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe adopts and disseminates an ideology that harms my community.
He is free.
“We too,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and that it was now "the former being known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince music changed its name to a symbol and, subsequently, the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was shot dead on Friday in eastern Belfast.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for playing the role of Sword Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old has denounced the male hero stereotype, stating that these roles make it clear that young boys often think they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said he believed "something had gone wrong" and that he was questioning how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married co-star of Game of Thrones, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, has admitted he is very determined to deal with this problem.
“Personally, now I wonder where we’re wrong about masculinity,” he says.
“What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?”
According to Kit, television can take part in the responsibility of increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its so masculine characters.
He added: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must have this facet of masculinity?
I think this is one of the biggest questions of our time: how do we change it?
“Something’s wrong with the young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for next summer, saying he is full of battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star a reposition of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best he has provided Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life forward,” she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of the character represented by Kit, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV for this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health workers at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT group is commonplace.
Considering the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have homosexual relationships end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate precautions for sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has filtered data from Republican senators and dismantles “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the demands were driven by far-right critics and websites.
"Lies, lies and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by an unknown person in the Capitol during a Senate committee session on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was filtered after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and that it was revealing information from a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
“This unfounded complaint is completely false and a pure lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this information leak.
This unfounded complaint is completely false and a pure invention.”
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of outrage,” Fleischer wrote.
"This makes you think you don't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
There is no question of the defendant’s motives.
You have to keep calm and serenity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running to overthrow Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces to these fraudulent statements.
“We will make sure that the criminals are revealed, and that they will be legally held responsible for all the actions they have taken and that they have harmed all and every one of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson’s Limited Spy Parody
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this repositioning of Johnny English’s action-comedy parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-assessment about how contemptuous we are will be a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the incompetent outgoing eyes and face of rubber Johnny English has been able to renew his license for the second time to twist it all. His name indicates more than anything else that is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking territories with a tradition of going to cinema.
Obviously, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a Mr. Bean point and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious Atkinson traveler who represented Barclaycard’s now forgotten television ads, where he was going to sow chaos everywhere.
There are a couple of good moments in my last trip.
I loved the Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the blades of the helicopter were replicating his helmet.
This is what Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems quite fluid and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be intended for more children than adults and, to me, Johnny English’s absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as the silent gags of Mr. Bean’s character that represents Atkinson.
The main premise is that the UK is now in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the service agent's consternation, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last appeal for a prime minister who is a pretentious and haunted figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this licky character of Teresa-May, but the script does not go further.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as each active spy is endangered, he will have to recover some of his retirees.
And this includes the evil Johnny English, now employed as a teacher at some luxury institution, but giving extra-official classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his sequace sufferer Bough, a role re-represented by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little unprofitable.
Thus, Batman and Robin of when things get very lazy at His Majesty's secret service enter into action once again and find in Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the charm of the charismatic billionaire tech who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madness: dressed in waitress, burning up a French fast-food restaurant, seemingly smuggling chaos on board Volta's luxury yacht and English causes a great confusion in trying to use a home virtual reality helmet to get acquainted with Volta.
All the stops have certainly been drawn from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and the noise it presents, it all seems like a children’s program.
Pretty normal things.
As with other Johnny English films, it has not been helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is setting up a plan for the British to have a four-day working week and cover five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan according to which the British will work four days a week and charge five.
The party supposedly wants the heads of companies to pass on the savings achieved with the AI revolution to workers by giving them one more day of celebration.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but receive the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit with the party’s economic agenda and plans to incline the country in favor of the workers.
The four-day working week shift has the support of the Trade Union Confederation Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be night to day, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits the party’s perspective of balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the party’s general industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration in a joint way at the moment.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: “A four-day working week is not party politics and the party is not considering it.”
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week’s party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to re-establish the power of “anonymous directors” and “speculators” to public service companies.
The minister’s plans in the shadow also imply that shareholders of water companies could not recover all the investment, as the Labour government could apply “deductions” for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees on boards of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector firms’ shares to employees, who expect to inject annual dividends up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence some Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light something that made them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
“I’m serious,” Kennedy said.
“At the session, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it all happened and the accusations were made public, and I asked him if he had done it.
He was firm, determined, and secure.”
But Graham's vote seems to be engraved on fire.
“I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would present an explosive charge,” he said.
"Mrs. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people you appoint will be able to verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, featuring an absolutely impressive star program, which carry out an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
At the seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global goal of the 20th anniversary event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defense group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people helping to actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless someone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), the attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other activity to overtake.
What success has Global Citizen achieved now that you have 12 years left to reach your goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or simply a case more than what we call "clickivism" (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reportedly recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which have helped achieve a number of goals.
It says these actions have helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies comparable to more than <0x24>37 billion, which will have impacted the lives of more than 2,250 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and ads derived from its shares, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that at the moment the protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based association of investors and makers, which is committed to “helping children grow as much as possible” and promises to send <0x24>35 million to Rwanda to help fight malnutrition.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a little bit of a page in history,” the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the crowd in London in July 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P<0x2B>Fs on his website that asked, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes we fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements we have won, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, featuring Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a "blocking" to hamper Russian energy exports (Secretary of Interior)
Washington can, “if necessary,” resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced that Russia’s intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern pandemic of Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
“The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to block its energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of the event celebrated by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that self-defines itself as the "power consumer's voice" in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are actually the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he said, indicating that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to step out of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said turned Berlin into a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost <0x24>11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that Energy cannot be a tool to push and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
The U.S. position has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (FDI), has called on the US to withdraw from the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will “think detentionously” about her 2020 presidential nomination.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “think detaineously” her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix the government’s fracture, for women to hold high offices,” he said.
“After November 6th, I will take my candidacy for president seriously.”
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was “leaving the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticisms of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “It is clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters believed they shouldn’t be submitted by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not be present, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the application.
The poll revealed broader support for former governor Deval Patrick’s nomination, with 38 percent in favor of a possible nomination and 48 percent in opposition.
Other high-profile names among Democrats that were taken into account in relation to a possible 2020 nomination include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes TEPT Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after joining on September 11, 2007
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"With what my own son has been going on since he returned, I can understand other families suffering from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional injuries our soldiers are returning with," Trump told the public at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following of his son and other war veterans: "They come back a little different, they get hardened, they come back wondering if there is respect for what his fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the ex-boyfriend, have done."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and holding arms under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district presented a curiae friend in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the sons of the violent gang member" attacked her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
They arrested her in Texas.
Advocates from the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation.”
Federal laws require asylum claims to be judged according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy denying entry of immigrants is damaging the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 announcement.
Asylum has never intended to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a spirit to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma while calming her son with fever in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance carries the bodies.
There is no drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to take flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of wounded, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital, as patients are being treated outside due to repeated severe shaking.
Tears denied his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
“I heard my wife cry for help and then I didn’t hear her anymore.
I don’t know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassing “propaganda ads”.
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday addressed China Daily’s payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, the state’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, an accusation that China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials have explained to Reuters that it is a new phase of Washington’s campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an intensifying trade war that has seen sweepstakes on mutual imports.
China’s revenge raids at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at punishing exporters of states, such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is doubling the harassment with the publication of propaganda advertisements in our free press."
“In disclosing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the esteemed American tradition of free speech and the press to insert a payment ad into The Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, in the kiosk downstairs here in Beijing, you will find little discrepancy and you will see no real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese citizens may have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party.”
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans separate women’s voters before mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
As many of the leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing multiple sexual assault claims, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans already officially show they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't get rid of," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute pressure on Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, head advisor and national spokeswoman for the MoveOn group, told the Washington, D.C., on Friday.
On Friday morning, Protestants shouted "November is coming!" (November is approaching) as they protested in the Senate lobby as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be out of the graph,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
“People say they’ve been tall; it’s true.
But it could have been more, especially among voters of suburban women and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don’t vote while they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, where he detailed his demands for sexual assault on the candidate in the Supreme Court, analysts would suggest a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
"This has become an embolism for the GOP," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits in the defendant's seat. It also has to do with how Republicans have handled this issue and how they've treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps the no-goers vote.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford star and the Kavanaugh witnesses, with the scale slightly declining towards the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents unquestionably or likelyly believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent claim to believe unquestionably or likelyly in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably lied or doubted during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same as Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the claims filed by Ford and, at least, another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the effects of alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez denounces that the Supreme Court candidate taught him his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s hidden intent was to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the emerging company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses the Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "online personal data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, pending task lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They’re all available in one browser at a time.
What is exclusive to the online personal data store is that it is the user who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is that the company integrates appropriate resources, processes and abilities to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said no one on his team is talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a Saturday’s Medium publication that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the Cross Victory of the I GM
The only clergyman in the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandchildren featured a commemorative lapida at a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the lapida was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning prose.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns."
He later ran towards the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage" he pushed the row forward before throwing himself over a cannon with one hand and leaving atone three members of the detachment.
The lieutenant colonel was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were a prose that could never match, which produces a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, directed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he will receive from many people.
Fans of the MMA who stayed sleepless all night to see Bellator 206, saw the Peppa Pig instead
Imagine you stay awake all night to see Bellator 206 and refuse to see the most important event.
The San José poster contained 13 fights, including six of the main card and had to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, UK viewers were appalled when the schedule changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were displeased to have spent the night awake until morning to see the struggle.
A Twitter follower described the change for cartoons as “a kind of vomiting acute.”
“Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is inadequate, so they changed to child programming,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communication at Bellator, when asked about the retransmission.
"Peppa the cart, yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But there are six in the morning of a Sunday and we can’t solve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at its time.
But we are working there.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all were pleasant.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. It was a government problem.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do. We tried to show it again by the followers, but it was over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels “Lower” About Sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to other people because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In the Desert Island Discs program on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about gay rights to give “hope” to other people.
He also said that his father had remained important to him to win the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a shipwreck on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" the others because "it was not socially acceptable as boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and strength to triumph.”
He wanted to prove that it was “something,” he said, not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without branches and that he wanted to give “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, “has caught us by surprise.”
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you pass so much when you are young (he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple were parents in June of a child to whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "his whole perspective" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold,” he said.
“There are things more important than the Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked for was if they already had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
“I couldn’t say, ‘Dad, you won’t be there to occupy the first row,’” he said.
“While holding his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Proud of Heather Small), which he had listened to during the preparation for the Olympics and still wore his chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A Mickelson Piercer Appeared at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to change his physical condition if he doesn’t want to become an unhappy hit.
Mickelson, who will participate in the two-year event to break a record for the 12th time, was presented by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's "fourballs" and "foursomes" modes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has always been for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments spends his time between doing animation and working in his game on the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the moment of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for the difficult Le Golf National track, where the long rough usually punishes the distracted shots.
And if his own trajectory is not discouraged enough, Mickelson will face the exact Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual matches, start strong, Mickelson's match could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, unable to say much more.
"She perfectly understood his role for that day, made me a palm on my back and surrounded me with my arm as he told me I was ready the next day," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a well-known show and has contributed a lot to these teams earlier and this week.
I probably didn’t think of him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that’s how I trained and that’s how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, just like anyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the maximum number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that has not matched its individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 empties, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has contributed intangible to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, joking, he likes to joke about people and he’s a great companion for the team,” he explained.
"I think the youngest players were having fun with him this week, which has been fun to see.
It brings much more to the side of his game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon fade away
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily become a tough day.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the American team, but eventually achieved victory by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep reminding us that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a little while," Bjorn said, in the picture, after seeing the 2018 team's 5-3 victory on both the 10th and 6th of Friday.
The story has taught me and all the members of the team that have not yet finished.
Tomorrow we will have to go to the machine.
You have to go out and do it all right.
This does not end until the points rise to the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do so.
“I’ve already said, I’m focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also know who our rivals are: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted by the performance of his players on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: “I will never hurry with that.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but individual duels test your ability to play golf to the fullest.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this moment, you leave your partner and he has to go out and take the best of himself.”
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than on a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on the last day's climbs, as he was part of the winning team in Brookline before finishing losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start with a good foot, as we saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has the challenge of attempting to start the climb against Rory McIlroy in the lead duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this order because I think it covers all the possibilities," Bjorn said of his selection for individual confrontations.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The new fleet of the German Navy should have ended in 2014 to replace the old Cold War war-era warships, but it will not do so until at least next year due to faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-construction problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-bug missiles, as well as anti-theft technology, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other highlights include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that the avant-garde ships, which were expected to project Germany as a powerful force overseas, will already be obsolete when they get into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 was already news last year, when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder once it was delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons for his return, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that rendered it useless if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, as approximately 120 sailors, half of the crew required for the former Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class vessels.
In addition, it has also been known that the ship's weight is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate will weigh twice as much as the class ships apparently used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the formation of the crew, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached some surprising <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) from an initial budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of particular importance, taking into account recent warnings that Germany's naval military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Navy "is left without ships that can be used."
The officer has claimed that the situation has worsened over time because they stopped using the old ships, but no new ones were provided as a replacement.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class fries could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of ratpenats
A new research carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to discover how rattans use the landscape to feed themselves.
The findings are expected to provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common rattans, as well as northern and water-eared rattans in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to track the activities of the rats during the station.
Volunteers and staff from the UK National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the rats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a habitat map will be created to create a detailed picture of the landscape of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation adviser at the National Foundation of Scotland, expects the results to show which areas of the habitat are most important to rats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for rattans and other associated species.
The population of rats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Building construction and restoration tasks threaten rats, as they affect the niches and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, such as paper scraps and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, rats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, ears are more useful to them than eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to locate insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the rattans very seriously.
He has ten experts with proper training, who carry out surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues in the usual way.
In fact, the organization has created Scotland's first and only reserve dedicated to rats at Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of rats in Scotland.
The estate’s administrator, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, at Threave, we have a great area for rats," he says.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But we still don’t know many aspects of the rats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
It notes the importance of checking if there are rats before doing maintenance tasks in properties, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest killed more than 400 females and young people, which could result in the disappearance of an entire local population.
Rattans are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, disturb and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official of the Scottish Ratpen Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn from rats and, in the case of some of our species, we don’t have enough data about their population.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the allegations of rape against him are “fake news” and has claimed that people “will become famous” thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the allegations.
The head of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid <0x24>375,000 at the time for the incident not to be made public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo said they were “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time winner of the Golden Pilot to the camera.
“They want to be famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it’s part of my job.
I am a happy man and everything is in order,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are already preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have described as “inadmissible information on suspicion of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Las Vegas Palms hotel and casino.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to reports filed at the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy", except a "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sexual intercourse, but were consented.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and was photographed of the injuries in the hospital, but later accepted an off-court deal because she was "fearful of retaliation" and worried she was "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she seeks to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to file for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he has filed for Juve, the Italian giant, in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million transaction.
Brexit: the UK "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
The UK "will always regret it" if you lose the world's leading manufacturing status after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota’s UK base had told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My point of view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without an agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU countries will work has aroused fears from other car manufacturers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in case of no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is made on a “just in time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and the European Union for car manufacturing.
If the UK leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on March 29, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector considers could generate delays and fish shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a result.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Tests not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production will stop, but in the long run, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and could lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of Unite the Union at the plant, said members are beginning to be very concerned about the situation: “For experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
According to the White House, Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be backwards
Donald Trump's expected meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "deposed for a week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues in White House statements on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, ties between Russia and Trump’s aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump bid farewell to the Deputy Attorney General and put Mueller’s independence at risk, he has fuelled the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times already reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House with rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump has said he would "prefer not" to say goodbye to Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate judicial committee at which Kavanaugh testified and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "No date has yet been fixed, it could be this week, although it may be a week longer for all matters with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists may refute this claim: Sanders has not held any White House information session since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he did not like the fanfare of television journalists, although he said, “I will not deny that they are fanfarers.”
Later, he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
“The president does more questions and answers sessions than any previous president,” he said, before adding the following without citing any source: “We have consulted this data.”
Sanders has stated that the information sessions will continue to take place, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen us do it a lot in recent weeks and they’ll replace the information sessions when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries on an official visit.
Individual press wheels are infrequent.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal and, at some point, strange appearance in front of the journalists gathered.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service out of fears of Brexit
The health secretary has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and wishes that they continue there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of residence-states applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and everything seems to be headed towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in case of a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know it’s a tough time for all of you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
The partners of the EU, and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the task of healthcare, while benefiting the patients and communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Christion Abercrombie, Tennessee State Tigers' rear-end, has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a head injury Saturday in the 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodore, according to Mike Organ, Tennessean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed has told the press that the injury occurred shortly before halfway through.
“He came to the band line and crashed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the gang before putting it in a bedside table and taking it to do more tests.
A Tennessee State official has informed Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had gone out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after firing from Illinois.
He had completed five scorings on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the new Conservative Party plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp tax will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Treasury expects to get up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to be charged a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of the Jeremy Corbyn movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in stamp tax will be taxed on those people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will be earmarked for government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
The company expects to earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it hard for new buyers not to open up on the property scale.
Many well-being areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "fantastic cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in timber tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the large buildings of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain’s “real estate disaster.”
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as lease controls and the completion of "no guilt".
He also wants to give more power to the municipalities to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it can’t be correct that it’s just as easy for people who don’t live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant and the indignity of homeless people makes it all even more real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his "highest ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman has accepted the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which currently ranks third in League One, at three points from the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was once called up as a support and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland play at Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it’s always something that makes me go back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in coaching clubs, but.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's ex-coach says he doesn't feel the pressure to be next on a list of names on such a big team, after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, my criterion to measure my success will be if I can get this team back to the Premier League.
"With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that its place is the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would only consider that I’ve been successful here if I can get the club back.”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months at the Hearts technical body.
He helped Alloa avoid falling to the third category and transformed the St Mirren from fighting for salvation to Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a decisive moment,” he recalled about accepting the charge at Alloa.
“I always thought training was the best thing I could do, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it well, I went out reasonably and enjoyed pretty good times.
But playing can be very hard.
There are a lot of things you have to overcome every week.
I still spend it on things like stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, it’s the most comfortable time I’ve ever felt since I was an adult.”

The perfect time for a painting is at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave has sparked consumption in Britain’s bars with difficulties, but has added more pressure to the restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains have increased sales by 2.7% in July, but consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of CGA's financial advisory board, the company that collected the data, says: "The continuous hours of sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup, which has been longer than expected, have made July follow a pattern of the 2, except for the 8% of the restaurant, which is the same as June.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by the consumption of beverages, have achieved the best results, while consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
People just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we consulted, beverage sales have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM’s leisure and hotel analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to external leisure market sales.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a 4.8% decrease in annual sales would be particularly damaging, rather than continuing pressure on costs.
This long and hot summer couldn’t have arrived at a worse time for the grocery stores serving food and the weather will tell if the most moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide this breath so necessary.”
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7% in July, indicating the slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The industry sales indicator The Coffer Peach Tracker for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operator groups, with a combined loss of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 million and is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, some aged 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in “fake Insta” pages
News has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show to their parents
One in five children, some aged 11, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in “fake Insta” accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a net “main” account that they show to their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a message from a teenage girl urging others to “violate me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Directors of Private Schools (HMC) of Independent Schools, revealed that 40% of adolescents aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of which have admitted to have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s troubling that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletics federation's directive
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation’s directive at the organization’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most medal-winning field and track athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from his dilapidated international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has the respect of the Scottish athletics community, the UK and the rest of the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I have a lot of desire to act as the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to grow the sport and contribute to Scotland.”
The American, who won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic bears and is currently a regular BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I can recover or to what degree.
It’s been exhausting, but I’ve recovered completely, I’ve learned to walk again and today it’s time to do agility exercises!
“Thank you for your message!”
An ad that compares mothers with cows shares opinion on the Internet
A tickler company has shared opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows that are breastfed.
To mark the launch of what is considered the “first silent tyre that can be brought from the world,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an announcement inspired by a joke music video to showcase the freedom that the new tyre gives to the seas.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of laughter and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm getting to myself, but you won't see any tail" and, "If you hadn't noticed, they're not panties, but my boobs."
The return continues: "Bomb, bomb, feed the babies, bomb, bomb, mumyo the girls."
However, the announcement, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom claim to show the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and breastfeed to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after childbirth,” one person wrote.

Another person commented: “Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a t-shirt for mothers who will keep their babies?”
Another user added: “It’s an off-site ad.”
Other people defended the ad; a woman admitted that she found the song to be "fun".
“I think it’s a great idea.
I’d buy one if I still had to give it to my mom.
Bombing for the trolley made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but it has to be taken as it is.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a fun ad for mothers who are pumping with scissors (usually at their workplace or in the toilet and feel like they're cows.
It’s not an announcement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the t-shirt discreetly placed on the supporters.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like they are cows when they use the t-shirt.
However, the Elvie t-shirt is completely silent, has no cable or tube and fits discreetly in a breastfeeding bra, which gives women more freedom to move, subject babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s first childhood partner and developer, said: “Elvie’s t-shirt is such a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
In tracing the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how to use a trolley and the challenges it is supposed to do, while at the same time demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new trolley.
This isn't the first time Elvie's t-shirt has been on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the hallway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of emigrant children retained has increased even though monthly entry across the border has practically remained stable, in part because the rhetorical toughness and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder for children to escape.
Traditionally, most parents were paperless immigrants, who were afraid to risk their chances of staying in the country if they decided to host a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential parents and other adults living in their homes would have to send fingerprints, which would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at the Immigration and Customs Control Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no previous criminal records.
About 80% of people who have hosted or live in the home of a person who has hosted are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In order to prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month after being detained, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than face-to-face, to defend their case to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The more time children spend in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent rampages or attempts to escape, according to workers and reports that the system has made known in recent months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, the signs that a child is suffering are overlooked.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria urges U.S., France and Turkey 'occupation forces' to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country already lasting eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the “war of terror has practically ended” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of a country hit by the war.
On the refugee issue, Muallem said the conditions were good for his return and blamed "some Western countries" for escaping "irrational fears" that make refugees want to stay away from them.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
"They are politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats have said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone at the last major rebel base, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue with political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
Muallem noted, however, that the agreement has "clear terms" and expressed hope that military action will face the jihadists, which include Al-Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to begin profiling a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump Will Win For The Second Time
According to this logic, Trump would win the 2020 election again unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, the scandals and the destitution process end with his presidency prematurely.
What would be, undoubtedly, “the end of a most dramatic presidency in history.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the number of spectators in peak audience hours has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in peak audience schedules, from the 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show", has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers reporting in the mainstream.
"People have been thrown into it because they don't understand it," said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor" series, about a cabinet decretarian who becomes the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
“He replied that because he made him laugh,” Scovell told me.
There is a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script that comes out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going beyond when you find yourself in the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts discuss the use that Bob Woodward has made of "for private use" sources for his book "Fear", the Washingtonian's leather jacket, the <0x24>15,000 leather jacket, the gold grit, and the Paul Storfort's handkerchief.
In my case, I will never see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes it seem like you're part of a reality TV show is that every night gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the character changes and script turns of Trump's program.
You can’t afford to miss any episodes because you’re left behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees Celsius and it was sunshine outside the house on the north coast of Kauai, but it was closed while watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
It could not be unleashed, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a wire.
“I remember when we were doing those sketchy programs then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it would be some kind of joke, but it seems they were right.”

External money floods the races of mid-term elections to the most adjusted House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realineation of congressional districts that has made two current members have to compete for the same square.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburgh involves Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was named in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in a very follow-up special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have been in office for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points of difference.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, but withdraws them
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his associates removed the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “recent decisions on not recognizing Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received US aid of <0x24>140 million in 2017, was considered, according to estimates, for drug trafficking control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high death toll for murder and disability.
With the steps of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending any probability of sanctions for the Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the administration's importance, diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys returned discreetly to their offices from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, including two diplomats, who agreed to debate internal deliberations from anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Study of History <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The next event to occur could be Special Attorney Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is numerous evidence in the public records.
As far as it is known, Mueller also investigates whether Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russia in its election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself accountable to the body, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even in front of a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s fall, or any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and we missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over points of inflection like this and accelerates or endangers the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing a number of moments of inflexibility.
What if Trump said goodbye to Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water in his throat since the newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly registering the president and speculated that it was not suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says the Times information is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, especially, will we vote in mid-Legislature a Congress that will be responsible for Trump?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will begin to run a risk.
But I don’t think we’ll fail, because I’ve already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador’s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the vacuum.
With this baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers, optimist for the match against the Vienna Rapids
The Rangers receive the Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive squad at the Vila-real field this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season to the quarter-finals 2-2 against Vila-Real, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to get great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We played the game thinking we could get a valuable result and we got out with a point.
Maybe we could have shot something more at the end, but, in general, the four was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first part, but we were better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it is another great European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game, but I’m sure we will give it anyway and we will get a good result with the support of the fans.
“Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it’s a good place to be.
The team is fine and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give it all, leave it behind last season and succeed.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of savings for retirement
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted them to be cared for, few people talked about it with the family.
Approximately half of respondents nationally say they have talked to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents say they have spoken to their children.
“People want someone in their family to take care of them, but they don’t dare to put it up,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
We have to start here.
Talk to your partner and your children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your desires in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Includes your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for your long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy of effective value that helps you to cover the expenses or a self-insurance, if necessary, with your own resources.
Prepare your legal documents: take the step in legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to designate a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the possibility of contracting a notarial takeover for your finances.
It is advisable to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly family has a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor to be determined, but also with which doctors to deal with,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Get this plan ready.”
Man shot several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has received several shots from a compressed air rifle as he returned home after going out at night.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
"Officials have described the shooting, which occurred around 2.30 a.m. (British Summer Time), as a "random act".
The victim has not seen his attacker.
His life is not in danger of injury and the police have called for witnesses.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities.
As communications are being cut off, the aid units have not been able to obtain information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu closest to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important data about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km of coast to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region less than one province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the Central Celebs province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The mining of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami in the west of Donggala killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific belt of fire and earthquakes are common with a certain frequency.
The following are the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that smashed the southern coastline and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 shook a pop-up area of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 shook one of the islands of Mentawai, on the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters that smashed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A soft earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and provoked destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and the deadly tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died as a result of the buildings that collapsed.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, 29, natural of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a known woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she pulled her phone.
Palin is detained at the interim detention center in Mat-Su, where he is held with a <0x24>500 non-guaranteed bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday when he was pronounced "innocent, with certainty" when asked how he was pronounced, according to the chain.
Palin faces three Class A shortcomings, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to <0x24>250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B deficiency, which can be punished with one day in prison and <0x24>2,000 in fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic aggression, interference with the reporting of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a gun in a drunken state in relation to the incident.
His wife said he had given him a punch in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for associating her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The quake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebs, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated on social networks with the moment of impact.

Federal Prosecutors Call for Extraordinary Death Penalty for Suspect of New York Terrorist Attack
New York federal prosecutors call for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people: an extraordinary punishment that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and to smuggle pedestrians and cyclists during his journey, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims “intentionally” and that he “intentionally” caused serious personal injuries, according to the notice of intent to request the death penalty presented in New York’s southern district.
Both crimes could result in a death penalty, according to the court’s document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attacked Saipov with a 22-default indictment that included eight charges of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in mafia cases, as well as a crime of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the attack required "substantial planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's behavior as "inhumane, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time New York's southern district brought a case of death penalty to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy for carrying out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police said they told the investigators that they felt good about what they had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, he also asked for the ISIS flag to be deployed in his hospital room.
He was convicted of 22 counts of wrongdoing.
David Patton, one of the public federal advocates representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision.
“We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty, rather than accept a declaration of guilt and a perpetual chain without the possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Party MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader has said politicians should “feel the pressure of Euroskeptics” when one of May’s own members of parliament has suggested they should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage were the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces when it comes to conciliating her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when the conservatives in favor of the union showed up in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain her Chequers commitment plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, EU and EU supporters.
The Allies insist that they will be able to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure the Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told Solihull's Leave Means Leave meeting that he wanted to get rid of Chequers' commitment.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out,” he said.
MEP Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to break Chequers’ commitment.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: “We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their mindset and want to stay there is totally false.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said in front of reporters: “I’m just telling her, Prime Minister, to listen to the people.”
“Chequers’ commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who come out to the street and make us win an election.
You quit Chequers’ commitment and started listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians at the rally should feel pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we won’t let them.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the political class, on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.”
“We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the union made a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small number of activists raised banners on conservatives against Brexit following the group’s launch this weekend.
Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives for the security problems they suffered with a party application at the beginning of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for the friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to consider the possibility of running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will look into running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, the usual critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been the center of speculation about the possibility of Trump resigning in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents with the open meeting format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked her if she was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our government that doesn’t work, and that includes a woman at the dome.”
Man Arrested for Killing Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at the 11:00 ET press conference.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the filmmaker.
Sims, 20, was shot and died near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims received a shot in the head that eventually killed him," police officer Murphy J. Paul told 247sports media on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got a shot from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to having been on the scene, in possession of a gun, and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody at the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2m junior player who grew up at Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after the team's orders gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas stood in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel went into boxing earlier and let Hamilton run with traffic at the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at boxing and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the free interior with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap was in seventh place on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position for much of the race, as he kept his wheels to save time, advance to Kimi Raikkonen and move to fourth position.
He eventually entered the boxing teams in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the pace in the next eight rounds and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It’s a hard day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me pass.
The team has done a fantastic job of having a one-two," Hamilton said.
His body language was awful.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday to insist she did not filter out Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate proved that people are "dollar, cruel and liars".
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry, bad, cruel and lying," he said.
"When you look at the communications and the leaks and say, 'No, it wasn't me.
It wasn’t me.”
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document? "Hey, what?
No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... No, we didn’t filter it,” she added as she imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and filtered in September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration proceeded from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter her story," Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to be confidential and I kept it as confidential as he asked me.”
But his denial displeased the President, who commented on Saturday night's rally: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purpose.
“They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, they don’t care who hurts, who they have to atropel to have power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite defeat against the Belfast Giants as they won the 5-3 return game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately got an advantage of two goals thanks to the finishes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard scored the Dundee, after which two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assist. Four minutes later, with the assistance of David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this agitated initial period, Sullivan repositioned the home team in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advantage at the first break when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to his level with a powerful goal in the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee an advantage for the first time during the match at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory with a fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are home to Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
Aerial controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from a plane crash
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero after he died to make sure that an airplane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake sank the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas are being produced in the area and there are many people trapped between the runes in the city of Palu.
But, despite his companions escaping to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat at the tempestuous control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It remained in its place to ensure that flight 6321, which was on track at the time, could take the flight safely.
He then walked out of the air traffic control tower when he thought it was going to sink.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“That broke my heart,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the runes and there are still many that have not been accessed,” said the agency’s Sutopo Purwo Nugroho spokesman.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, who will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying aid and decommissioning.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All mini-markets have been sacked.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working against clock to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the crash in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that was set to land in a Pacific volcano in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although it was previously said that the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, since Saturday afternoon, they did not find a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed while trying to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane fell in love with the lagoon because the track was short.
Some witnesses believe the plane crossed the track too high.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was flying very low.
“This was extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the waist to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who were working nearby to improve a spring also helped rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to land before the plane sinks about 30 meters into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered at PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst writes a chronology of the night a woman burned alive
The prosecutor's office closed the case on Saturday in a review of a man's trial accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to build the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, as his truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that it was only a week that they knew each other.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to pass into the hands of the jury during the same day.
The High Breed: What is Hip-Hop Conscious?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative vision of the genre.
Bristol’s The High Breed says hip-hop has separated from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop trends again.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK from the hand of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Mainadera of NY demands goodbye to couple after "racist" message
A New York miner has reported a couple for a discriminatory farewell after receiving a misdirected text message from her mother protesting because she was "another black person."
The couple denies that they are racist and compare the lawsuit with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed consternation at seeing that the new mistress, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at work on the first day of 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER BLACK PERSON," Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to her husband, he sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After noticing her pipe, an "inconvenient" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman said goodbye to Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the landowner she had said goodbye, who was African-American, had done her job badly and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the payment corresponding to her working day and then sent her home with an Uber.
Maurice now demands compensation for the farewell and demands compensation of approximately <0x24>350 a day for the six-month residency job for which she had been hired, even though there was no contract.
“I want to show them that things can’t be done like this,” he told the Post on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have responded to the statements that they are racist, claiming that Maurice's farewell was the most reasonable, since they were afraid of not being able to trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
He's not racist.
We are not racist people,” his husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve been angry with, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who has compared the lawsuit to an “extortion,” said that his wife had two months left to have a baby and that she was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to chase something like that?
It’s not a very friendly attitude,” added the investor banker.
The legal case is yet to be resolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks and to condemn their behavior and their logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers would not identify with a speaking bone, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in connection with the letter: "It is difficult to replace someone who read it for the first time before its publication.
It’s very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a little hairy bone, was optimistic about the book's rejection. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "sweet", after his death.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and adds that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous man," he said.
“But, as Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son gets something: you’re proud, even if it’s not your thing.
I think he considered Paddington’s success that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
On landing, they rushed his daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked to save her life.
“Nad called frequently to say that it was very difficult and they didn’t expect it to be overtaken,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I called Nad and he told me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll go with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medicines that had been given to him for his body to continue battling were being consumed and were coming out of his system.
He had died before what was expected and that was how it all ended.
I just had to sit down and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to stay in good shape.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience that was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
“I had my head up and tears didn’t stop falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for overwhelming Nad.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I loved her so much.”
Women of sorrow hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and, at the age of 18, killed himself.
“I don’t want any father or mother to feel what I have to feel every day,” she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, residing in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile could illuminate any room.”
However, he quit his job before dying because he was in a “very dark spot.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after taking his own life.
Mrs Davis said, "I'm constantly concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs Davis created the cards "so that people know there are people who can go to, who can listen, even if it's a friend.
Do not be silent; you must speak.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a friend of Mrs. Davies years ago, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
“He never said he wasn’t well, he wasn’t depressed or anything like that,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw a change of attitude.
He played deep on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their gifts and he didn’t look them in the eyes.”
He said his death meant a great trauma to them, but they have to work it out: "Open a hole in the family.
It destroys us.
But we have to keep fighting.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is shattered by a thread as the FBI launches an investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity," Mr. Flake said Saturday. He also added that he feared that the committee would be destroyed with the roots of the supporters' deadline.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
There are only five weeks left for the midterm elections on 6 November. If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will be weakened when it comes to getting the man they want to get elected to reach the country's top court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and press them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to drop the four and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of deserters ‘caused’ with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said 1,127 deserts had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and rising prices charged by traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Typically, the vast majority of North Korean deserters are offered the nationality of South Korea.
Seoul sources say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants, rather than refugees, and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between North and South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on denuclearization talks.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general to work to achieve a Korean peninsula free of nuclear energy.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and not fit to work in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and her temper inability to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted this way, they would have told her that she was a 'historic'," Pelosi said in connection with her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied allegations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and saying no words as he talked about his family and his years at the institute.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s democrats and said the charges against him meant a “grotesque and coordinated murder of a character” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as it showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if it is confirmed, and if Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you're not only not able to be in the Supreme Court, but also not in the court where you are now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge at the District Court of Appeal for the District Circuit of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he avoided questions about whether he would annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the Court and expect it to seem wonderful to us,” Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise their power.
It is a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and cannot be removed without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon. And you?"
“I was very helpful to a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, telling the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m tired.
I'm angry."
And then it continued.
It looked brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because, basically, they are misinterpreted.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in a male-majority office, where once I ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of a older woman (a cold directive that had always terrorized me a bit) who grabbed me from the claw and threw me at it.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they’ll have you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic deputy from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital adventure on a ship called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate for president.
“It wasn’t a well-meditated decision,” she told me as I was reading 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said to him, "White and the seven dwarfs."
As she arrived late in the campaign, she was late with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn’t join the race if she didn’t raise <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated <0x24>1,000 to men, were only willing to donate <0x24>250 to her.
“Do you think I have a discount?” she asked.
When she gave her speech and announced that she was not going to start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (thank you for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and to orient herself to voters, instead of doing it to delegates, and anger was felt, and sexism was.
“You might have thought I had a nervous crisis,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the reaction of the press.
“You could have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my grave?
"Will she cry?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The initial bailouts from the trade war between the US and China were overwhelming and, although it does not appear that the war has to end soon, a distance the countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, when it imposed taxes on China’s major exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting products worth <0x24>200,000 billion. These tariffs imply a taxation on half of all goods arriving in the U.S. from China.
Beijing has contracted every time in the same way and recently raised tariffs from five to ten percent for <0x24>60 billion in US goods.
China has pledged to replicate the U.S. and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economy will be back soon.
Taking Washington backwards involves surrendering to some demands, but publicly bowing to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that trigger a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than the witnesses had anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is “ready” for refugees to return, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to be abandoned because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime appreciates any help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or the aid of the countries that financed the insurgency.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, shot the water out at the hole 3 16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his series and became one of the four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since starting the current format of the tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with a 5&4 by Denmark's least-qualified player Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-run Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 race points.
“I don’t cry, but I can’t avoid it today.
It has been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m so glad I got the cup back.
The team is the most important ... and I’m happy to have been able to help,” said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
The relay passes to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup racing record.
A strange statistic for one of the best players ever, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning there was a time when we pushed the European team.
We've fought.
I'm going to take Thomas.
He is a great captain.
The 12 players have played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and I am proud to have been their captain.
We have to take out the bar.
He defeated us.”
