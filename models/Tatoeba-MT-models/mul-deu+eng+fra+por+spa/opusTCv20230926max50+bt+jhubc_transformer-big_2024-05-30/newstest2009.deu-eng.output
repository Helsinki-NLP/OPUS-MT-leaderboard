The Prague Stock Exchange is falling to the minus against the closing of the business.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ’s shares accounted for almost half of the normal day-to-day business.
The Prague Stock Exchange fell by another six percentage points at the start of Tuesday's trades at the start of Monday's break-in.
This time, the reason for the breach was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market’s reaction to the result of the vote by the US House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Fall of shares in Asia
A dramatic fall occurred on Tuesday in the stock market in Asia, although the indexes were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points over the course of the business day, but could later bet a part of the losses, reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, declined by 3.8 percent, while the markets closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent, according to the index.
“The timing for the rescue operation in the United States is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide,” said the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its own monetary policy, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the bill to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the intrusion.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to <0x24>700 billion (almost <0x24>12 trillion) should be spent.
Legislators ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would regulate the underlying causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks suffered a bloodshed on Monday, and the main stock indexes recorded the biggest breakdown in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, a similar breakdown it had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any indications that the draft would not pass in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concessions: U.S. government can pump <0x24>700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial aid for the U.S. financial system.
This is to be voted on at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers reached a breakthrough in talks about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid for the U.S. financial system in the amount of <0x24>700 billion (approximately <0x24>12 trillion).
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
Members of Congress must negotiate some more details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on the final draft of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
In the Senate, different figures suggest that the plan could probably be voted on at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a notification that the plan will be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for the revival of financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there will be a "rejuvenation" due to the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets also in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a significant progress.
We have clarified our differing views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like,” Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
He said there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislature met on Sunday night with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form.
It provides for the purchase of non-sold mortgage assets from financial companies, which will put financial companies in serious losses and jeopardize the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We need to continue the health plan, but I think we’re on target,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is also hitting the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada's Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final consensus in Congress before Sunday.
This is to calm investors in the face of trades on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a decision by Congress could affect the trades on Monday.
However, it is not yet clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also uncertainty as to whether the last-minute negotiations could still have a problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will undergo some further changes.
The total amount of aid for the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial <0x24>350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
But Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, with an additional <0x24>100 billion and later the final <0x24>350 billion.
Bush considers progress in negotiations positive
Although the president has a veto right in this decision, Congress can vote his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained, based on obtaining finances for the purchase of poor mortgage securities that have fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgage.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate on Monday,” Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
US President Bush was also pleased with the progress made.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and “appreciated the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief merchant, said the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to restrict the so-called golden umbrellas for directors of the companies involved in the programme and set up a committee to supervise the fund.
This is to be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on it and have made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for homeowners who have trouble repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys, with the goal of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because you don't know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses with each other,” Marek told the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not decisive in Marek’s view.
"It is much more important that Congressionals agree to support the plan and to say goodbye to it as soon as possible.
“The psychological significance of the agreement that there is an adoption is the most important thing at this moment,” Marek said.
Duel on knife cut: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call yet.
Therefore, of course, it seems that it is better to buy just a phone.
After all, there are plenty of reasons why you should hire an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
Sure, it’s hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also simplified with music on travel, i.e. compressed music - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand kroner for a player, but also a Pink Floyd fan will probably have a hard time pushing headphones for twenty kroner out of the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide-ranging.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do doesn’t even make them.
No modern device is as universal to use as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephone and Sims, it can play music and videos, it has a better one, a worse one, and it can also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV photograph.
However, the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to download it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Only a few phones can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this regard, Music Players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, with cheap phones, you should expect them to be able to play music for no more than a few hours.
If you’re still on the phone from time to time, you’d rather buy a charger for the office – this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won't have this problem, even the less good ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one charge.
Another problem is when you want to play the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB port, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly on a memory medium, but only a few card readers can handle without reduction with the small memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players, you don’t need special software until exceptions (iPod).
You only need to power the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players create their own music library, sorted by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only make up the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, phones can more
When selecting a specific device, you should in particular consider the battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course the convenience of operation.
If music is especially scenery for you and you listen to it every day just briefly, for example, on the tram, then any phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What almost every phone can do.
You also don’t have to control which music formats a phone or a player can process.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will be right in this format.
The format is one of the most common, and in addition, most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to access the respective pages of a provider (or another provider) via the mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can be a striking argument in and of itself on why you should wear a music bath.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and is usually limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of music sales (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most of them carry their phones.
If you want to listen to something, grab your phone in your pocket while the player is at home.
However, it depends on whether you are always wearing headphones or at least a wireless free speech device.
If not, you can get back to the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music handsets will be in the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand kroner.
For three and four thousand kroner you get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most people will be that they don’t have regular headphones.
The best and technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5mm opening for regular headphones cost up to fifteen thousand kroner.
The advantage of the player lies in its easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - Player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of features, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no threat of collision in the form of a mistakenly configured mobile internet and a subsequent horrifying invoice for data transfers.
Which device should you use now
Also the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand kroner is enough.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive ones can even read 8GB of memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then use Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB), you don’t have to put more than 1100 kroner on the table.
If you are among the most demanding listeners, you prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the convenience of operation comes to the individual MP3 player.
The farthest is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series phones have the same user interface as the individual MP3 players sold.
The same services in the same price category of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,000, but with higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) give you MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics to lower prices.
Maybe this one won't wait for long.
The fact that the Czech mobile providers are among the most expensive in Europe has been reported on Mobil.cz.
This was also confirmed by the Telecommunications Authority <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which pointed out that the price of an SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps taken by the European Commission in regulating roaming fees, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile carriers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a fight announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile phone providers like to shy away from the fact that there is an extremely high level of competition on the Czech market.
The Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) Chairman of the Council, Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, has often stated in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It’s probably true that a classic provider with its own network doesn’t have very many opportunities (by the way, it would hardly find frequencies either).
But there is another option - a virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market that brought with it a significant price reduction, to which also the classic mobile providers had to respond.
There were similar voices in the UK before companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don’t have to look for examples for long.
In February, we reported the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100,000 customers and thus become the country’s fifth largest provider.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, is behind mobilization.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to work effectively, virtual vendors need far less customers than a classic vendor.
They do not require relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies – they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less comprehensive service offering.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good chess move to put on a non-clicky target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose mobile - the provider they like and can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the company that operates this virtual provider.
It’s hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could stand in the Czech Republic as well.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offering."
In the Czech Republic chancelos, say mobile phone providers
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
“While we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look particularly hopeful.
It is more likely that Mobilking will enter the market in other countries of our region,” said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for Penta Finance Group, in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
It indirectly confirmed that the current mobile radio providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
The GTS Nowera Group has long shown its interest in launching a virtual mobile provider, which wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them, we were already able to achieve negotiation progress," said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Non-official information suggests that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
“At this point, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has great specificity compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of Telefónica O2 said in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other suppliers also point to the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with O2’s statement: “So far we have not found a viable and beneficial project on both sides on which to build further.”
And she adds: “In the network of T-Mobile, by the end of the year, a virtual provider will hardly appear.
At this point, we should already have a concrete offer to be able to think so short-term."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider the best from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet.”
Responsible authorities - hand in hand with the suppliers
It is easy to understand how mobile providers act, another provider would call it more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why should such a competitor make it easier to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull on a string when it comes to something also proves the long way around the creation of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was at the time when U:fon came to the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also demonstrated by the publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>TU websites.
Now, however, U:fon is rightly suited as an argument for why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile provider.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services."
However, in view of this approach of the mobile operator, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is astounded.
This is not just about the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which in the Czech Republic unfortunately - unlike the UK and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, relates to this whole problem its typical attitude.
“The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between a mobile provider and a virtual provider through the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
So far no such contract has been concluded, as the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for the classic providers," said Kristián Chalupa of the Department of Foreign Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS in his reply to our request.
Such a wording would not be surprising to the representatives of the providers.
This is more than suspicious from an authority that represents the interests of consumers and is intended, inter alia, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign country, where virtual providers work quite normally, it is observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services."
However, it is likely that pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are not in the interests of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
It is really shocking that in this case the almost already ringing harmony of the three mobile radio providers, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is at stake.
Just like the exact same gasoline price at the gas stations, it is certainly just a coincidence and the result of a fierce competition.
“The Authority has not discovered any indications in this respect that it is advisable to act against competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so he also does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his trading in the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market to virtual providers are also likely to be lacking by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, after telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile providers has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different perspective - for a virtual provider to enter the market, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And, of course, the mobile carrier has the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not agree with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile phone providers are strikingly similar.
Complaints by a number of interested parties (including the company GTS Nowera mentioned above) prove that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The removal of responsibility to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted Novelle of the Telecommunications Act, the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> has failed to implement the expansion of the competences of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of professionals have promised an improvement of the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know that too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay when no one's looking
Firstly, the operation of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unobserved.
These are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partially public.
Typically, these are companies that operate in the field of multi-level marketing.
For example, mobile phone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the selected.
The joke is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile providers prohibit a similar type of resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual terms, which we will then deal with, which can lead to an termination of cooperation with the relevant company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that something like this will not happen to the operators of mobile phones.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned above, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such a procedure.
In fact, the activities of these companies do not lead to overlooked profits, but at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out the possible problems: "The law allows such kinds of speculation, after all, the services of these companies are used by only a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot fully have it like the normal customers of mobile phone providers."
Alone, however, the <0xC4><0x8C>TU should at least be strange.
In addition, another question opens up for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Mobile phone providers close their eyes to such a move, why are they locking themselves against a virtual provider?
It is added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to satisfy itself with the providers’ statement, they would not know anything about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers brought with it a marked drop in prices for the various services.
In virtually all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence practically more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a too small or too saturated market, problems with the quality of the services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies were taking action at these moments, not in any way trying to protect the interests of the mobile phone providers, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and followed this.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that uncertainty in the competences in these cases is more than advantageous.
But we don't throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is true and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon re-emerge.
If a provider allows the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other stakeholders.
And the Czechs will finally not call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home country on the occasion of the day of Czech Statehood.
The hymn was re-recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in chorus and in an instrumental version.
The composition was taken over by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremias and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions equally.
For B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already in the past, he had told the Czech broadcaster that he had chosen young, representative voices for the solo variants that are distinctive and popular.
“From the beginning, I tried with both and then with the choir to follow a clear diction so that the text is well understood, so that a harmony is created,” said the conductor.
The Czech National Anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j first sounded on stage in 1834 in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, which was composed by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>krup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first slogan of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven symbols of the state even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the "new" hymn sound like?
For the first time on a chip on Wednesday, the Prague transport companies also
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of the Prague transport companies as a date on which the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper pass will enter a subway, tram or bus.
Currently, about one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card can buy them.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and can record it simultaneously on their chip card at the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the subway stations of Ra<0xC5><0x88>anj, Ka<0xC5><0x88>kaj, Ka<0xC5><0x9B>y<0xC5><0xA1>ov, M<0xC5><0xAF>stelyvice, Ko<0xC5><0xBE>e<0xC5><0xBE>ina, Kodra<0xC5><0xBE>ina.
The coupons have also been available on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon.
Those who use the internet sale can really forget the outlet window in the subway stations, where they have until now had to regularly wait in long lines for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the internet, it is recorded on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branch offices of the city library.
"In these places, the traveler also has a switch with trained staff, who advises the interested party on online shopping and also records the coupon on the map," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons at self-service machines on the Opencard, which are installed in some subway vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket holders, the passengers may have already noticed them in the subway stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The coupon controls an automatic machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work tomorrow is simple.
You just have to insert the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays on its own.
The electronic coupons will apply not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings from tomorrow.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants from the municipalities of the Central Bohemia region arrive in the capital.
"In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated transport, the trains have readers with which they can check the validity of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid. This organization puts together the schedules for the Prague transport services.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver’s checkout.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the opencard must be placed in a marked place on the side of the box.
In this way, the driver controls the validity of the coupons played.
“If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons played, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information,” Drápal said.
A passenger who does not travel on suburban buses and does not know when the coupon expires can go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
The information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudanese demanded a people’s decision from the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans had requested the United States to join the Bohemian Forest.
This is reflected in a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, then we want to at least live under the protection of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans were supposed to have contacted the President of the United States in 1945.
This is reflected, among other things, in a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau asked the President of the United States not to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of Hitler's Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure that the American units will not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, “people whose destiny is at the heart of the Suddens.”
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - suspect that they would expect brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the U.S. Presidents to address the U.S. Presidents, the U.S. Presidents and the U.S. Presidents
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million people in this area, you are advocating a foreign state that is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing to the Allies’ victory,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge wishes of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president has any doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Germans, it would be sufficient if he initiated a popular decision in the Bohemian Forest on whether the residents would become part of the U.S. or want to live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today’s knowledge of post-war history may sound somewhat naive, it does, however, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, draws a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Bohemian Germans had to at least guess that they would be negotiating their expulsion from the Republic, few of them agreed to such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetens.
Once again, others thought they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
It is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used as a Buddhist German in the Baltic Sea Navy during the war.
When he arrived in British captivity at the end of the war and was brought to a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czechs would suit them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, in his opinion, expected to be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
If you don't think - then pay!
An Emotional Campaign for Drivers
The most expensive action for road safety in Czech history.
Even so, the emotion-filled media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday, could be characterised.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s authority pledges to remove drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The <0x24>150 million campaign will be on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to discourage drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember to wear belts before driving.
The campaign aims to raise awareness among young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional motorists.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially the stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The “bloody” slogan of the entire campaign also shows this:
If you don't think - then pay!
The words "doesn't remember" are in capital letters on a badge.
And then in a blood clot the word “pay”.
This is meant to mean that you can pay a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the viewers by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see very normal images with drastic footage of casualties.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and the number of traffic deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and peat for drivers
"The motto for the drivers is sugar bread and peat.
Sugar bread means that they save time, for example, when driving at red.
The threat is the threat of punishment or accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án.
And that’s why information campaigns are needed in the press and, above all, negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
Even less effective are, in his opinion, signs that alert drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static board that warns of a danger, it will likely soon flow with the surrounding area, and the drivers will no longer notice it," says Ko<0xC5><0x99>án.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The President of the Israeli Provisional Government, Ehud Olmert, has expressed his support for the surrender of virtually all the territories that were occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace could be concluded in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He stressed this in an interview printed Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all, if not all, of the occupied territories,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territories) because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers rolling over his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templers and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he continued.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert expressed his support for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which, in his view, is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the sides of Damascus.
“My proposal is not to make peace with Syria on the sole basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights,” Olmert said.
“The Syrians only know too well what they have to give up to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to give up the constant support that they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida, and the Heijin prime minister.
Question after the accident: Are Stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus it is not allowed to go around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to go and leave during the bus ride.
“If we wanted to comply strictly and formally with the law, then the activity of a steward would be contrary to the Road Traffic Act,” said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck that crossed the bus.
The young woman was sitting next to the driver in the least secure seat in the car, despite the fact that she had two more seats.
However, a bus can also have an accident or slow down sharply in which the Steward carries coffee or newspapers.
It is also a matter of whether the bus is still equipped with standing spaces for the vehicle note.
If this is not provided in the bus, the passengers must sit.
The Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no stops, as confirmed by the company’s director, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, to Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“We discussed this with the ministry, and this first did not agree with the movement of travelers.
This was later taken back, and we have reached a consensus that travelers may go to the toilet during the ride if they have their seat,” he said.
The law does not recognize a steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legislation that prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only recognizes the concept of vehicle operators; however, its rights and obligations do not define it," said Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry.
On the other hand, the director of the road vehicles department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> believes that the law subsequently covers this issue.
"It depends on whether the bus also has stops in the product approval.
That’s all,” he stressed.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are stops and the maximum speed is limited, public buses with stops and a higher allowed speed and long-distance buses without stops with the highest permissible speed and seats, which are securely fitted out.
As in the plane, says the expert
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"With a liquid driving licence, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an airplane.
Even here, it is not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can hit her head."
"But if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The safety of the stewards must clarify the carrier by internal regulations," he says and also believes that this problem is not fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company to offer Stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this role.
The director does not consider her profession risky even after the accident.
“As soon as I get the impression that the manager’s profession is risky, I’m going to delete it.
Guests can get coffee and newspapers upon boarding.
That would also reduce costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of Stewards in his bus, but his company operates only a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency.
“We don’t have food, so we’ve been fighting from the start.
Sooner or later, this ends with some kind of deadly accident,” he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a line bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the region of Pilsen, who had worked for the company for two years, was injured.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent from the stand without flashing and had blocked the bus from driving.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front of the truck.
The fact that the two seats were sold to the Stewards argues Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"These seats can't be reserved for remote connections, they're blocked."
The company will sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the agency will not wait for the court’s verdict, but it will also expect financial compensation from the culprit.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more detailed regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has already been working for over a year.
"However, this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving,” says Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activities of the Stewards to be something that could substantially jeopardize the safety of passengers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the jurisdiction of the police and occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the WestLB Board of Directors to the employees of the House.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf Monetary Institute with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could be created, according to the letter published on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And in any case, such a link could be the decisive incentive for further bundling in the national banking sector.
This is how it is read when a board wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult times.
The WestLB is still under a lot of pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian government has only recently made clear that it is time to find a future solution.
However, there has been a long-standing connection between the Deka Bank, which is known by the savings banks due to their investment funds, and the WestLB – also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka Bank CEO Franz Waas announced the semi-annual figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a national bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he does not see any sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Dean, which is always supported by half of the national banks and the savings banking associations, has commissioned the Board of Directors to hold talks with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have been open, as it is said in the financial place, just started.
The Deka Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers in Frankfurt’s financial district, is not the first time that it is a matter of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that the deka bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
However, there was nothing from this trinity.
The plans had hardly been made public, the Hessian government opposed the participation of the Helaba.
The other two houses did not find each other either.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz took place at the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there has been repeated thought games over a link between the deka bank and national banks.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, the chairman of the board of directors of the Helaba, had decided against planning games about a merger with his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to mature the knowledge that a contraction of the various houses of the public sector does not need.
After the country’s parliamentary elections in Bavaria are over, a link between Bavaria and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
Should the pressure for further mergers increase, the partners will gradually go out for it.
In the south, it would only be a junior partner, although it has survived the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In a merger with West LB, the Hessen-Thüringen Sparkassen- und Giroverband, which is 85 percent involved in the Helaba, has pushed a line at the beginning of the year.
Stay at the North LB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, it is about how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, with which business model to ensure the future capability of the national banks, had not yet been answered by the German Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a breakdown of the West LB, which is not self-explanatory there.
This is also the case in the letter of the Board of Directors there, that there will certainly be a "total solution" for the House.
How the merger of individual units with the deka bank can bring under a hat will still be shown.
The second Vienna weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena, it’s the first time, for Luca, it’s the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with her friend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer tasting of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built beer tasting and proves to about 200 Oktoberfest travellers what deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena gives Luca a clap, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to Puerta Nuova train station, this evening at 23.45 four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della berra", arrive expected at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans sing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelzimite lining and a glasses with wide silver irons, includes the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours are on their own this year.
Nightly, daytime on the Wiesn, back at 10:30 p.m.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Beer, baked faithful to Bavarian purity, health insurance and German-speaking travel - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - includes.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
It will quickly be quiet on the bus, the passengers will sleep.
Well, they'll still need their strength.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian stamps on the motorway 8 just before Munich take a break again.
Finally, when Marcos Group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, it is planned to arrive at half-seven in the early hours, and the other 50 buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First, set the yellow cap.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in fracture, next to the Internet address of Marcos Reisebüro: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors to the beer tent open up, it's called running!", Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not on the front, otherwise we will block, and not all the yellow hats on the same bench, in the room!"
The measure, says Marco, cost 8.25 euros.
And don't forget drinking money.
"The security people show that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone.”
Thirdly, "Tonight we'll find point half eleven again here!" Understood?
And we're going to the grass.
On the way, a yellow cap as roadmarks binds to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
You want to be armed for the retreat.
It is the second Wiesn weekend, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; the number of 50,000 who make their way across the Alps and enter the beer tents is said to be 10% of all visitors extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which runs a nation-statistics in which Italians before the British (approximately 60 operations) and Austrians (approximately 80) are supplying about 200 medical supplies.
Especially popular among Italians is the Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said last week.
How good it is that the politician used the word "relative" and also influenced that the German banking sector will not be spared from the crisis-ridden developments.
Because she's in on the weekend.
The Munich real estate funder Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in the Dax, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said on Monday that the credit aid amounted to up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part it also takes.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background are losses at daughter Deffa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money, the state financer had refinanced himself extremely short-term – which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserves decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, while the equity share had slightly decreased from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current revenues and net revenues from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the previous year period, revenues from allocations to receivables and certain securities, as well as the dissolution of loan transactions, fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from reimbursement of deferred settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Deffa Group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the taxation order and from the business provision for group companies, the return decrease of around 16 per cent was still moderate.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financer had initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which were then split into Aareal Bank.
Due to the inadequacy of traditional government funding, the Deffa had become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "substantial material effect" on the group's profit and loss accounting, it is quite indeterminate.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
In 2007, it was cut by two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Deffa, Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financer.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market because it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks has again largely failed as the banks were holding their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a part of Deffa’s short-term loan portfolio for refinancing – around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion annually.
According to the announcement by Hipo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs with the loan are covered for an awkward period of time and the company is shielded “from the influence of the currently largely dysfunctional international money markets”.
From other sources, it can be heard that thanks to the funds, refinancing will be secured by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke said, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable period of time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the market capability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank to hope.
But given the dynamics and imbalances of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that funding does not need to be fully mobilised.
But the opposite is also not to be worn out.
Since the bank still faced insolvency late on Sunday night, at least the temporary rescue could not calm the minds.
The stock price breaks by 75 percent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.30.
However, the bond prices are fairly well maintained.
While the priority debts are barely moving, the rates of backward bonds are more pronounced.
The bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, of course, the maturity periods beyond 2009 are particularly affected.
If hypo-real-estate bonds appear to be a speculative investment alternative, then their validity must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the sharp exacerbation of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the acquisition of the Deffa.
As long as notary banks, governments and less affected business banks are still ready to support the system, as long as a timely reduction in pensions can be assumed.
Or it comes down to what hardly anyone currently dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports overlap with partial nationalisation, the likelihood of security limiting has now only become a legitimate hope.
This is especially likely for long-term believers to prepare some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate from their commitments.
After all, short-term investors can use a final line to form a loss allowance for future compensation tax payments on course gains in later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls begin to whisper: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Before I went to school, I had Bammel.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn’t run.
The beginning of the lesson in Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as our home in Lower Saxony.
Students enter from eight o’clock until about nine o’clock starts a brief meeting with the teacher, the ‘home room’.
But before the lesson started, it was time for me to introduce myself.
I am not the type who likes to talk in front of people, or in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I wore an old skirt from my host mother, including blouses, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the pole and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At the time, I was very happy that I had started learning the language well two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all whispered, whispered, and whispered, and I heard the word "kawaii" all the time.
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the surviving vocabulary of Japanese girls and means ‘sweet, sweet’.
Then I quickly got to my place.
The girl next to me has been pretty broad, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was fairly quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really depressed.
Everybody was talking, whispering and asking me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all their bentos were packed out.
My host mother had also made me such a lunch box - this is something different than the oedema German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small spices, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofu coat.
Most of the time I don’t have a blazing shimmer, which is exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things look odd and taste completely new.
The truth is that everything is really delicious.
Well, until the salty plums, maybe, brrrr!
The bentos are not just for lunch in Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a self-made bento, which she then crafts especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the pause snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm just wondering if I can watch this too.
'Why is Japan calculated?', my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
"Because I'm fascinated."
I have been reading my favorite manga for years.
And in order for me to understand the comics and the culture in it, I also started to learn a little Japanese sometime.
So it was clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And you put great value on it here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I still haven’t felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have feelings.
Does a rat or a snail flee in danger mean that it also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how can you check if they feel the same when they behave similarly to us?
For several years, the online journal "Edge" has published contributions from renowned scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far, where we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we should at least hope, as all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to another species and slash questions of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter immovable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it sets itself up dead, flees, or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude to a similar subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to convey our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with the human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This wide region is much higher developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to assume that man is different even from the other primates.
Another dramatic characteristic should lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, whatever it may be, is probably very different from most of our state of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness might look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or measured because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, then his research poses great problems to us.
Most of my excerpts refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically more accessible.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals regardless of their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the case of visualization.
But this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, tends to focus on the neural correlations of consciousness rather than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the state of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I refer them back to the fact that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a conscious brain of its own activity.
What we call “fear” is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) proves to be working memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that distinguish primates and especially humans.
Associated with the linguistic nature, subtle degrees of feeling result, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar, in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
On the other hand, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that sensations from more primitive activities in the body’s sense regions of the cortex and brain strain are similar to Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain strain.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-cutting sensations.
Theoretically, I cannot object to it, but I think it is unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears in rats and people like fear probably feels like this in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
A sheep runs away at risk if she is also afraid?
In my eyes, mere similarity of behavior cannot yet prove equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain strains, sharks, on the other hand, do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if one could prove it to humans, how would one want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even shrimp (who knows?), have sensations.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress on the neural level, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
Just as I don’t study language and consciousness in rats, so I don’t know if they exist.
You might think this is short-sighted, but I prefer to go ahead rather than constantly running against a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Deadline for mercy for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of the UEFA in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to hold the European Union together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the schedule for the construction or remodeling of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts hang behind.
Possibly even the number of EM stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We need to work at the highest speed now,” said Ukrainian Federation President Grigori Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious risk that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer among them."
Several first leaguers had been convicted last season alone for manipulation to forced deportation, eventually even the league start had to be postponed for a short time.
Dennis Quaid is back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about Privates - and now has trouble with Ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outlet her fiancée Dennis Quaid as a bribe.
It sparks - and knocks back.
Late Rose War with ex-married Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant dispute with each other - in public.
In an interview with US magazine InStyle, Meg Ryan said for the first time: "Dennis has been disloyal to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud has not experienced it until after the divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - told the story of a marriage breakdown.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his outing as a disloyal husband was clear: “Unhappy,” the 54-year-old told The New York Daily News, “meg repeatedly re-examines and condenses the history of our relationship.”
It is also “sad” that the 16-year-old son Jack is once again “publicly reminded of the pain and the upheavals that mean a divorce for every child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become the father of twins.
And so he concludes his entries with the side whistle: "My life goes on anyway.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that’s doing best.”
Prices of air tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008, and after price increases in the first quarter, a significant breakdown was observed in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays have already become affordable in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year ago.
As a reason for this, American Express sees the weak dollar rate, which has led to a “decreasing excitement of American tourists.”
Financial venues such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial venues such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3 percent even hold the record in Europe.
The airfare trend in the first quarter also showed upwards:
Due to kerosene taxation, travellers in the economy class on average had to pay 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy-class airline tickets dropped by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first-class prices, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices broke even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, prices have even been halved, according to the study.
The reason for the price breakdown is, on the one hand, the declining economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is fracturing.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe, increases competitive pressure.
Signs of the tense situation are the removal of non-profit routes by airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV strikes Gladbach 1-0
With a gateway and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the table guide.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning elf.
From Kristoffer Klein increases break landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came late to the game and failed with a lever to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, it went over his lips convincingly.
He simply knew that he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger at the entrance to the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not set in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them were back in their seats.
Rieger was a HSV physiotherapist for almost three decades, he enjoys a higher reputation than some of the elusive actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nicked and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His command is similarly heard: Here with gate two!
Implementation was lacking.
“It wasn’t all good to watch today,” added Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted to be more relaxed.
The 1-0 (1:0) is due to Mladen Petric’s headball defeat (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
The spectators once celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which designated their club as a class privilege.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to fix that," said Marcell Jansen.
He thinks that the table intermediate evidence is more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team, with their late commitments - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen, who was thrown away by FC Bayern - is slow, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol demanded.
After the loss of voting
On Wall Street, fear disappears.
First news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily broke the Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss in a day in his history.
Later, the Dow got something back.
By 8:30 p.m., the world’s leading stock market barometer scored well 5% minus 10,579 counters.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was down by more than seven percent at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which fell almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No titles could be added.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs accounted for almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
The rescue plan is intended to provide funds for the purchase of so-called fake mortgage securities.
However, the sum should not be paid on a stroke, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive stock options banknotes from financial companies that could be redeemed in the event of appropriate rate developments in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the United States in downtown
The billion-dollar aid for banks in Europe and the United States does not address investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the German Großbank Hypo Real Estate is falling and tearing down the dax.
The Dow Jones Index loses despite the planned financial market rescue by the state.
Spectacular price losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have deepened the German Stock Index (Dax).
In spite of the bailout by the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate funder’s share temporarily lost three quarters of its value, which Commerzbank gave up by more than 20 percent.
The Dax was clearly among the psychologically important 6000-point mark and scored a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Stock markets all over the world fell to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s <0x24>700 billion bailout could not be enough to boost the financial markets back.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first trading hour or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, which could be followed by a vote in the Senate on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially dropped by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Leitindex Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 counters after initial wins.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Leitindex Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 counters.
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor surrendered after the announcement of a capital increase.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark Matter Affects Flight from Space Probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has led to recklessness: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft flew through space.
Due to the soon freezing fuel lines, you are now threatened with the cold death.
For years, scientists have been creating a mysterious phenomenon of confusion - the Swing-by-Anomaly.
Swing-by is a flight maneuver by space probes, in which they receive additional swing in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
But what the researchers have been wondering for years is that the flying bodies do not behave 100 percent as they would expect under the ancient law of gravity.
Rather, there are irregularities in the speed.
The probes are unexpectedly getting faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They beat him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general relativity theory, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers in the universe have invented.
“The one responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about a decade.
It is evident that there is a force of attraction that can be observed on other celestial bodies.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it emits and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
After all, according to the calculations of scientists, dark matter accounts well for one-fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt are expected to be released again, the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom money.
In a shooting before the release, six hostages were said to have been killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Redemption negotiations are already underway.
Again and again, Germans are in the sight of kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists trapped in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media accordingly.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are just checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian escorts, are on the run and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The reasons behind a shooting before the release of the hostages remain unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom,” the official said.
It was "just about receiving the hostages," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, arresting two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be detained until the hijackers have a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abusing the stepfather "conduced to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather have led to a woman committing suicide, a court of law has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he regularly held his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found out that Mrs Randle was abducted at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had locked her and her eyes closed before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a guest house.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found out that Mrs. Randle, who volunteered much of her time for the National Trust, was tracked down by the abuse that had been attributed to her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs Randle, who had been a passionate surfer and cyclist, had been “emotional dead” since 2006 and had “abandoned her life.”
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter, which ended as follows: "I kept her clinging and connecting her eyes."
“I didn’t sexually force her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are an extremely alien fetishist and for her victim it must have been scary, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse, the fact is that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended in court if she had not done so.”
He added: “I take note of the impact, according to Stephanie’s father and mother, her actions over the years had on her daughter.
Otherwise, she would have clearly been a promising, successful and happy young woman.”
Officials responsible for loss of data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was dismissed by the Department of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest indictment within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said, "They would have thought that this would be internally dealt with by the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet."
An employee whose name cannot be named will be charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Public Prosecutor’s Office recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he submitted included classified assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Homeowners see B&B Costs in mind
British housing companies could be incurred more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers’ deposits.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The director general of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was “intolerable” that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The <0x24>14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley’s loans are disbursed.
But the interest accrued in the meantime is charged every year to those 700 financial firms who accept the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Program confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have been cautious... are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay together about 18% of the cost.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies have to earn 81 million pounds for the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have been cautious during the real estate uprising will now be called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the records existed in 1945.
“We will look at all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs.”
Interests due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are non-company organizations, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk gets five pence per liter more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per liter from Monday.
It’s the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after a consulting firm’s investigations have been carried out.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey Milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail attempt by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Their lawyers said the court refused bail on the charge of extorting 50 million Taka (<0x24>729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government should first grant her unlimited freedom.
Correspondents say that, although her detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as to whether she will continue to be free when she returns to Bangladesh as part of her release.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bailout request because it says she does not need to be given a bail as she is already on probation overseas to be treated overseas," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file a lawsuit against the Supreme Court.”
Their lawyers claim they need a deposit to return from abroad to the country in order to prepare for the December election.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17, a Awami Alliance party chairman said on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Concerns about the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a U.N. spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or hinder thousands of vaccinated workers.
BskyB loses appeal in ITV case
BskyB has lost its appeal against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to under 7.5%.
In the past, the Commission had claimed that the share of BskyBs distorted the competition and allowed it to have a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB raised doubts about the independence of ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Office Ofcom have voted against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that it wanted to give up its voting rights.
New Investigation in the U.S. Attorney’s Office
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a Special Attorney to deal with the dismissal of nine U.S. Attorneys General in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administration staff were criticized.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that lawyers had been suspended for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is now expected to clarify whether the officials interviewed during the investigation have lied to the investigators to obstruct justice.
Serious allegations including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Justice Department deposed nine U.S. prosecutors in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that prosecutors would be fired due to poor employment.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, prompting many observers to consider the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate allegations of election fraud by Democrats.
U.S. Attorneys are tasked with investigating and prosecuting cases for the government.
They may be fired at any time, but may not be suspended for political reasons.
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, then head of the Ministry of Justice, was fired because of the dismissals and eventually dropped his office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also cancelled.
In particular, the report of the Inspector General has critically addressed the role of Gonzales, bearing the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, "resigning" his leadership role, and "extremely disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former chief advisor to President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for their lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be celebrated
The Rockstar Meat Loaf will be honored during the music awards "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special gold award in London next week during the ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track for Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's awards, after it came into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of Q Magazine Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond issues such as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years on the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute constipation.
Later it was announced that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main traffic streets, alleys, side streets and other surrounding streets, some of which are famous and others just convenient.
Nevertheless, it is even hard for experienced taxi drivers and longtime locals to say where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This small street is located in East Village and runs from First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty passage than an actively used passageway.
There are no street signs either.
It is virtually impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This road has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to redesign Extra Place to create a clean passage through the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the long-standing neighborhood, which says she is fascinated by the short streets, simply because she is one of the remains of the house block's past.
However, the city department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in getting them.
During a meeting of the Municipality Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the municipality and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Still, the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district manager at the City Council 3.
“Only very little space has remained in the city’s possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city,” she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street will be rebuilt and seats designed, among other things, for a cafe that the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the road, but it didn’t necessarily want them to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate these declining streets and make them a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was the city’s desire to sell the road, and stressed that the department’s task was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802 when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among its numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by no one.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the Punk Rock Memorial, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is probably best known as the scenery for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of dirt, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be left to rest.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A bitter nostalgic look at the extinct city"), has published a part of the city's talk about Extra Place, which was in the magazine "The New Yorkers in the Years 52" in The New Yorkers.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow sackhouse that remains dark even during the day and is marked by enclosed metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past rainforests."
With a few exceptions, the street looked exactly like this recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that once led to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti were seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road might be slightly polished.
Fields added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the excitement of the street in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, wet and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: education in an English-speaking environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Research Associate in California Studies and Senior Director in Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Choice".
Addressing Spanish voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign notes that “the likelihood of African-American and Hispanic students successfully graduating from school is lower than that of white students” – which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition in education for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, Obama’s question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take, for example, “Sixth Street Prep”, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom are recently in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, astonishing 100 percent of fourth grade students passed the state exam in mathematics at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth year of school were rated good in the English exam.
This astonishing success has been achieved by methods other than those preferred by Obama.
The School Sixth Street focuses on review and exercise, on constant control of knowledge, and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
In addition, the school is practicing the approach according to which the training is carried out in an English-speaking environment, which is precisely the point that Obama should pay attention to, says school principal Linda Mikel.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of the English language in the field of instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school would have had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later you would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize it anymore.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the “Sixth Street Prep” as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English learners?
The school’s achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the national associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education.
While agreeing with the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "English only."
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work, rather than disdaining and trivializing them.
Oil prices are falling as a result of renewed fears about the economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the U.S. bailout plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
Raw oil futures on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent to <0x24>99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than <0x24>20.
Over the past two weeks, the commodity markets have been shaken by both financial turbulence on Wall Street and strong storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices peaked at <0x24>145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost <0x24>90 per barrel this month to rise again as a result of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have again expressed concern, despite congressional representatives announcing that they had agreed on a rescue plan over the weekend, which should be the biggest in history.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the first and final chapter of the growing crisis, Citigroup is expected to buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to a government statement on Monday.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it has apparently failed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote in a statement to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they continue to write, that the commodity markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of commodity markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. American virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China.”
The Bank’s analysts have adjusted downwards their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 fell by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter set
Interior Defender Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything after he'd been wearing the jets more often than anyone else in the last eight-and-a-half years.
Then, on Sunday, he saw the second quarter in which the Jets turned an unsuccessful game into a triumphant move.
“I’ve never seen anything like that before,” Ellis said.
After a sluggish match between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their developing collaboration took a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one of which ran out as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-life.
"I didn't get very upset," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing catching, defense quarterback Kurt Warner broke up.
External defender Darrelle Revis took off an unfortunate throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and dropped him off.
Linebacker David Bowens then led Warner to a loss.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the most crazy.
The Cardinals had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets regained the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, replied, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answer, both of them, because the Jets left 21 points in the third quarter without achieving a single point, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short time."
Brought-out brass lease breaks his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some consider him the best long-distance runner of all time after breaking his own record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to travel 42.2 kilometres in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the win on the flat course at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous score of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year.
Gebrselassie, 35, has set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or a world record on every track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, out of fear, which was perhaps exaggerated in the aftermath, that air pollution could exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he applied for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sunshine and 9 degrees at start and 13 degrees at goal - bristle loss won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train drivers such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have switched to long distances, the record marathon time in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with a score of 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his waist two weeks ago and could not train for a week.
Obviously, after a break, he came back refreshed and not roasted.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed training a week ago and I had some concerns today, but at the end everything was great.”
He has been criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopian rivals from East Africa – for over-orchestrated his races, dealing with many of the world’s best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race drivers as if it were a rail race, and set a world record over the record.
However, this criticism hardly harms the size of knitted lashes as long-distance runners.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the track at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have continued to challenge breastfeeding after the pacemakers dropped.
Just over three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last appearance to separate from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi is third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, completed a significant year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The 2:15:25 world record holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She quickly planned her run by letting out a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners, but outdated after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came third in 2:25:01.
The pride and streaks in the lives of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the swamps of the amusement parks around Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, noisy and gigantic drives, lies a quiet city where the pride and the complications of African-American culture emerge.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston it did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet pitches, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no schools."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that describes it – and that made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida travel guide, which was produced during the depression by the Federal Writer Project – is in many ways a place of a very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, generous and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what's going on with him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation on race relations, many people here continue to suffer from being watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a member of the city's oldest church.
It has to be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a fortress of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South that has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and on the hat.
And so rightly the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her home town to the world in books that came from hearts and were written in mouth, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Travel Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through Florida’s often-forgotten center, to the centerpieces of black history and human drama.
Like Oskar in real life as well as in literature, Hurston reader led to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to private affairs.
"Away from the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-stricken modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, although he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and what-even-ever fits in classrooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls who perpetuated Hurston by quoting the men singing songs about her beauty that were full of sexual inclinations.
She added, "Some people don't like this."
Hurtson is still remembered here as a lively eccentricist who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came to town, she usually did this without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that even today imagines something about her venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most residents were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "She never stayed too long," he added as he sneered in his chair, on a backward terrace overlooking the Sabelia Lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were stolen.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no large commemoration, no public lectures in great style.
“I don’t think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-track highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the municipality’s slow two-track main road.
Orlando’s suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial confusion brought hatred into the community.
"At this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting away," Franklin said.
“There was once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.”
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand to force integration by calling its decision in the Brown case against the school board "offensive rather than respecting my race".
Residents today say that although the abolition of racial separation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group’s cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
"Black children were accustomed to being hugged - I remember - they hugged their teacher in the morning and they hugged their teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group for the protection of Eaton.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, the civil rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who have gone through prejudices, as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone be free?
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out on her way to Hurston's unnamed grave and began to fight for the revival of her glory.
Five years later, a highly praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelfs, and made it again part of the American literature canon.
The long-distance project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public light.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many come back for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-track highway revived the city, accelerated the whole at peak speed, aroused real citizen pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd put it a little simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city’s self-image.
There were more and more train lines, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the nationwide historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on Kennedy Boulevard, which was newly paved and embellished.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back street in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She is currently 90% black.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval is required in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicted by black men in fieldwork - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a brave, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew larger, an increased degree of homeland pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and diligent, albernating and blending like any other race and people group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that one can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police, which he says may need some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people who just walk through here will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after church.
“But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, there is a fluent financial latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept themselves away from the newspaper stands and huge TV screens on Times Square, they wouldn’t even realize they’re in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, every day have the worst day of horror work since the 1929 stock exchange collapse.
The suppliers are still pushing the metal tea weighers along the civic trail with noisy folds and transporting tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still wandering between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with the 50 curved t-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod lying on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting on their breakfast bars on the street, and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until I decided on Thursday afternoon, due to all the world slump, to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to put my duty on time on the quiet afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase Tribal Branch, about 20 people were already in line.
Not at the cashiers to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service switch where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists about the way to the Macy's store, and where new customers open accounts.
Most before me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal licensed banking employee", for the same reason as I snake.
unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, to places from which they were traveling, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called Thrifts (a bit like a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went quietly and quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets worth <0x24>327 billion, went bankrupt and as last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns savings worth <0x24>440 billion, was looking for a rescue.
Fearing a further collapse, the office and shop staff who stood in front of me brought their bars to a bank that is considered a safe harbour, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have become well-suited to flowing financial latex in recent weeks.
A woman who phoned at my Chinese parent supermarket spoke with so much familiarity about Lehman Brothers, the pleite bank and their slim-looking board chairman Dick Full, as if she were blaming a fake colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformized concierge in my block, has gone away from our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any more risks."
Muslim graves humiliated during right-wing rally in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian right-wing Liberal Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to organize "Cities Against Islamization".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, carved with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of the grave damage at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend on the far-right party registering significant gains in the country’s parliamentary elections.
More than 90 tombs at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged on the night of Friday morning, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to conceal the motive of the extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokeswoman for the local Islamic community said she was "deeply shocked" about the news of the burial damage, which took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan is about to end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is taking place in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The FP<0xC3><0x96> and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received nearly 30% of the vote, advocated in their campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law, and some of their claims were criticized as alien-hostile by opponents.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FP<0xC3><0x96>, who won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on head towels and burkas, and even expressed his aversion to food that is generally associated with Islam.
In his last speech in Vienna, he spoke of a “European Brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, stating that the far right is the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Overseas Travel Bar for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam rock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges set up a six-month lockdown after he informed the authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent were granted last Thursday to impose a travel ban after they presented evidence to the judges for Glitter’s pre-trial sentences for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court of Justice said: "On Thursday, September 25, the Kent police at the Ashford District Court requested permission to prevent Mr Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain by March 25.
Paul Gadd was not present personally.”
According to the Register of Sexual Offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter’s possible place of residence in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent’s police unit said: “The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad.”
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the highest concern of the Kent police to protect the residents of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sexual offenders in the country to minimize any risk that could be present for the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he planned to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn’t feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him through passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to the UK.
Finally, on August 22, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to request him to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is calm and pleased that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
‘I receive the master behind the scenes to retain his character’, Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no rumors, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are strange to the audience, I know when I can find typical gestures for the personality, the depths of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands that are concerned because they will not be able to enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents varied theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamenco display at different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the month of photography of Flamenco, `reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is growing day by day,', explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco people' `every person can be typh, but if you notice the picture, you can't look at the picture.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey on stage passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to retain the personality of these artists, you do not need to take pictures on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What I was interested in was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco comedians with the camera."
Inspired by the Cante de las Minas Festival, Bauer embarked on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the camera’s image-ordering function and the existing material, images were created that resemble classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical foundation of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea, as the farmer understands flamenco: ‘Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day’.
This is not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play in itself, but the artist’s personality, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essence, for something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, is and has been the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Flamenco celebrities including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of Flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to recapture this idea two years ago and to become a ‘portrait of the veterans of sports’ (‘SportARTproject’).
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives to `I really like photographing people, getting to know them and moving me into their state of life, be it for a short moment or a long time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or meet people, people you don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
The collection of portraits of the flamenco of today entitled `Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotomata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he's just writing is "a craziness."
He still does not know where the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to move forward with the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo and went to the Amazon for twenty years.
Yesterday, during his attendance at the Hay Festival Segovia, the Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project he is dealing with is "a madness" and "everything indicates that he shouldn't write the novel".
'If I had dreamed, I wouldn't have done it, but I'll do it and hope to end the novel someday', so he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days he had hundreds of people seen in writers, historians, taugo and journalists.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding figures at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Hay Festival and to which most attendees voted, is compared to the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was presented by Félix Romeo, and found that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who had a wonderful memory and great sense of humour, had not been given enough time to get through it all over again; as his appeal to the literature, as he had arisen, from the "external" and the "external"
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is `no way' to measure and how to know if books can change life, `but I refuse to believe that literature is not about pure entertainment, I ask people, it's a fugitive experience', `before', `before Vargas Llosa', and `who claims that `they'
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play: bullfighting was partly off.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting fortress, with which the festival was to be completed in Pozoblanco, was postponed to yesterday morning.
The organizer, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfighting.
Thus, the festival of the unstable weather was suspended, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
It was raining on Saturday, so the second planned bullfighting could not be celebrated.
The group of Matadore consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullfighting arena.
There was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more through galoping than through his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Julio, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, a large part of the audience reacted to his second battle with buh-claps.
In <0xC3><0x81>lava, two people wanted to escape control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilograms of Hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Two police officers called on the drivers of the car to stop, after which they took the flight.
It seemed as if they had to stop with the cargo of more than two thousand kilograms of Hashish.
Police tracked her down and arrested one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A. A. J., according to the Basque State Interior Ministry.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the <0xC3><0x81>lava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a carriage to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the pursuit until the car stopped after a few kilometres on the edge of the strip. At the moment, the drivers stepped out of the carriage to escape across a country road into a forest area.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of Hashish, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to other police stations for precise laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles.
In addition, the officials noted that the identification mark was ‘double’, so that it did not correspond to the identification mark indicated in the car documents, which is why a further arrest was made for falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza are continuing the investigations to carry out the arrest of the second suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, was able to escape, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A.A.J. was taken to a police station for interrogation and will be presented to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda in the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness has observed her trying to get out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, a spokesperson for the California traffic police reported to People magazine.
The Witness explained in detail that Locklear “pressed the gas pedal after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she held her sunglasses several times.”
A little later, the Witness, who at first probably did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby road and getting out of the car.
The Witness was the person who notified the Emergency Service because she was 'fearing about Locklears'.
When the police came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street and blocked traffic.
'They seemed to be unintended', which is why they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress proved to be cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. `The first observations of the officials as a result, we believe Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', the spokesman said.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined and taken to a local inquiry prison around 19:00.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from a clinic in Arizona, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Callazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief coordinator of the VL and Member of the United Left, today assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who was interviewed after last week's family was returned to school.
"In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one that has to take responsibility for it," Callazares pointed out, pointing out the party's actions towards the one that has so far been sitting as a city councillor in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the President of VL defended the need for ‘transparency’ in the possible investigations of the infringements that Silva could have initiated: ‘The VL always insisted that such cases maintain maximum transparency’.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has a "strict code of ethics for all public offices".
`Sangre de Mayo': Hero Book by Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de Mayo' represents the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with approximately 15 million euros invested for the filming.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to ‘represent a lot of personalities and social analysis’, which he has always admired the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directorial.
`Sange de Mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and later shown on the broadcaster Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós’ literature, assures that thanks to this filming work his `trauma de la infancia' went into fulfillment. This he owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the Autonomous Community of Madrid base basidios, a commemorative film from all the years before the `three of the history of Madrid in November 2nd.
The total contribution of 15 million, made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filming, Garci, as he added, offers the 'unique possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding dressings the image of the 'confounded Spain, which was chosen to be the wrong leader of the battle under the backdrop of the VI, because of the undependent of the people.
However, the Cineast regrets that it was not possible to count on funding as with `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as with `Sangre de Mayo'), which is why some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci was unable to co-operate almost his entire career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also the director of film in `Volver a empezar', has been involved in his usual way of working: he went on stage with the actors who had to try first before you started filming. and for those who had made the best part of the film, he was working on the part of the ` and the `erschitting' in the `.
Many actors he encounters in `Sange de Mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, like in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillerén Cuervo.
Garci, an Oscar nominee in four nominations (of which he has won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `sangre de mayo' nor `sangre de mayo', nor `sangre de mayo', nor `Siellers de mesas'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“In the beginning, you think you’re working for the offspring, later you realize that it’s only for fertility, and now you’re happy when you’ve produced a movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional work.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville honours a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe during the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.”
'We're not trying to tell her life without keeping her spirit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance backgrounds have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, the `Dance of the Butterfly' appeared to me like Guajira, or the `Dance of the Snake' like Tango.
Her dance was meaningful and I was told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area,” she says.
The stage has two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in ‘La puerta abierta’; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her former pupils.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy that she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honoured."
The stage also features musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the violin of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he was always taking over the role of the baller.
This work also tells a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in as far away places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a particular era and whose works are no longer available today and therefore know how to appreciate them even less,” Bayón says.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta reciente casado' also includes the Triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta nuevo casado' at the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, provides an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Council of the Andalusian Council.
Thus, the `triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the `exhibition of the hiking was now in New York, Juan Ramón Jiménez was in the `representation of the international: `Aquel chopo de luz' is in the .
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta nuevo casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso, which aims to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more famous.
The U.S. can’t imagine it without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in Sensational Reporter, and from the then-dominant American cinema show, which was left behind, from all over America to Newman with his enthusiastic show and followed her.
Let’s see what it cost to give him an Oscar.
When he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Yet it was a big blow for everyone.
"What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, crying, "my life and my country were the greatest absurdities of his life."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
As the ‘father’ of cinema and homeland, he died in a sad moment in which fear of terrorists and market collapse prevails, in which Americans’ declining self-esteem is in search of hopeless reasons for retaining dignity.
If in this difficult time without virtue only a few people can be admired, you don’t necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he almost embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as many losses as many gains: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from his first marriage who died of overdose to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country, where it cost him a lot of effort to go against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of admiration hits Hollywood to take over, regardless of nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man has died, but the entire era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said working with Newman was no more or no less than the tip of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“The greatest of us all has left,” said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today try to live as confident as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high demands for justice, leading responsible privacy, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there’s someone trying to do it, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, whom he was faithful, although there were certainly many ways to not be.
‘Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?’ he often jokes himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, on none he was as proud as on the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive opa and the philanthropist,” they say.
The roads in Madrid are lacking for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympics in Madrid, after the failure of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, ‘Are we ready for that?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it is not true!
It was called the perfect street, and in my opinion, it was the worst street with everything drum and drum that there was.
Of course, that’s a lot of nonsense if you look at the review and I could check it out if something like that hadn’t been done.
But let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pickup that allows you to go first.
It doesn’t seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chips to avoid getting stuck on the street).
So don't.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there) and (after an infinite waiting queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric?
So good, things like these are a little bit compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting time of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as expected, the road began and we had not let our backpacks lie in front of it, even if once it was successful, but it would be harder to get them back.
In addition, it looked like it was raining in these 40 minutes of waiting, so there was a temptation to organize a popular uprising and attack the house.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even show up in time for the classification because of this chip I got, I can already think that the output was wrongly stamped.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect road, that road would never fit me.
So I think we will be dreaming for a long time from a city that is well prepared for the Olympics
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi while it's on its own (or, in the case of Microsoft, it's on its own).
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this ‘receptionist’ can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also categorize attendees into groups after the conversations.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group with which she talks, and that he is not a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will be listening soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster, man, Steven, that would be for the few.
It’s all just a statement, given that Microsoft added one or another feature and ‘extras’ in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth it
Microsoft is right, the operating system gradually loses importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, it was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many have pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an essential part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to sharing something with his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its ‘death’, not as an absolute, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is a confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer, or Chrome, and we spend more time browsing every day than in the 'windows' environment.
What is the use of half of the applications on the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In fact, they need it, no doubt. I will give a small example of it.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, one of the recreational spaces for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the refrigeration machine: `Your search. Our future'. Please use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google, used for online research.
By the way, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even 2010.
Microsoft is looking to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market simultaneously.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso used it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the dress of a well-built parishioner.
When we begin to count the countless star appearances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard that had raised heavy weights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and strapless.
The English-speaking people call it `tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. Legend has it that the name creation is associated with sport and originated from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' surpasses everyone because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive Unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag ( barely recognizable) that has these t-shirts as a detail at the neckline.
And attention, the Belgian company is not just focused on the production of `tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, Cotton Pants, T-Shirts with Stripes, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
It is a shame to use them as underwear.
They're very charming.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is beautiful, but full of joy in life.
Currently, the Gruz brothers take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some beautiful and wealthy girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, relocating her home and also making the presentation of the most important prizes in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Compassionate and shy, winner on the short runs.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for mango, also I attended the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for mango?
My sister and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find a lot of ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dressed, combining their clothes, that’s what I do often.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything happens in one and these areas have a lot in common.
Ever since I was a child, I was excited about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to wrap around my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and at the rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you move into the real role of an actress.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so much respect for the costume designers and their professionalism.
Recently you've turned 30, haven't you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than ever, when I’m 30, I feel good.
I think the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I am not afraid of my biological clock.
I’ve done the things I wanted to do since I was a kid and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time now I know that I will become a mother because my body demands it, and I also want to be a young mother; I don’t want to let that go.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
I will give my child great feelings of happiness and raise it with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works that you took part in and that were shot last year.
This is exactly what I want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much hope that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be listed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A couple of days ago, you showed up on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
All right, don't say anything.
It’s not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization Women for a Better World and the clothes we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection have been made to the NGOs for delivery to Mango.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There's a lot to be told about her, and I, as the one who knows her, would tell you that they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a stand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
Drivers who may become reluctant due to the alcohol level will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The authorities order that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, install this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholic, then the car does not jump on.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney-General's Office. According to them, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to re-socialize the driver, which is why he gets a course for the re-education of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Attorney General’s Office, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automotive Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were shown more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol again sat on the wheel.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostart when the driver has done alcohol tests; or when an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000, the costs are borne by the one who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to take action against this behaviour before it becomes a crime.
And to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be implemented in the usual way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is required, which is necessary for the criminal prosecution process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, not in any store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
With British timeliness, at 5:40 p.m., at the time set by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez de México Airport DF, the Spanish Air Force aircraft, with the Prince and Princess of Asturias, landed.
The sun went down, but their rays were still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal pair coming out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people to the airport at this time you're from here or so
No, she's the Spaniard, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, that's good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and princess of Asturias is and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including the military protection of 27 navy soldiers who give away the honorary ointment.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the princess, with long hair armored by the wind, without ordinary `peep-toes', may have been informed that there is expected a storm in DF.
Before they enter the room, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, where the official sequel awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television who likes to make jokes awaits her.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no substantially excellent fashion designer and bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international promotion of young fashion talent.
This will be awarded with a cash prize of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday at the showcase of the Mango Branch on Boulevard Haussmann 54 in Paris and almost wept over the emotional excitement.
By the way, it is the company’s second-largest store in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest store is located in London.
So many events have taken place that you would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner at the Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table, organized by Mango, seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain of his brother's recent death, crawled together. He drew the suit from the fashion house and wore some of ELAH's jewelry that were stunning. He held himself on the arm of his son Luis, who is about two feet tall and has been at the arm of his grandfather Luis.
Andik, the owner and master of the mango house, greeted the guests and was such a knight that he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without jackets, because the jackets they borrowed from the lady.
Mónica Cruz, hurried to the shop and had a pants and a shirt she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet samples.
Inés Sastre did not join the walk through the rooms of the palace, but before that she showed us the photos of her son on her phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always sparked a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, upon his arrival (with his own bed sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smell.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.

Talking in sleep
Some children talk at night
I don’t mean those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder, which is called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and young people.
Sure, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, as during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason why this phenomenon occurs.
Often, connections with other phenomena in sleep are sought, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (bed nausea at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be very high fiber, stress situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one is quietly speaking in individual words, whispering or it can be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult with a specialist to check if there is a problem, which causes anxiety, and in this way occurs.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoea or with stress).
What can be done is to carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV shows that are terrible and something too wild.
In nervous children, relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace of mind.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
When speaking occurs in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful Advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if it shows fear after a few phenomena, then it is recommended to consult or find out what reason the child has for fear.
When they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct a hearing and get more information.
This way you will not be able to achieve anything because when the child is asleep, he is unconscious and unable to think about it.
In addition, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Perhaps, it does not tell the child that you hear this at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, that’s a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long drought, Illhäuser on the playground is finally back on track.
Without much effort, the Yellow-Black played numerous torch opportunities and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers struggled to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose television shot just passed by at the corner, Illhausen should easily dominate the game, and it was succeeded in alternating only Fonderflick with a television shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot pedal.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with first two torch chances fought by Riahi and Temporal, and immediately thereafter with the first torch for the Illy Houses by Marais, which stood just right to take back a ball that had been fired by Diebold in a first attempt.
However, the ill-fated goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which forced his teammates to continue to play numerically inferior.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not face any major problems for an Ilhaeusian elf, who only withdrew a little to 'condense' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big breakthrough.
Sarkozy meets angry fisherman
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour to Britain.
Given the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to meet at the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promise to receive him ‘with a constructive spirit’, and hope that he will come with ‘concrete proposals’.
The president’s visit is at the same time as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee, set up by the Breton fishermen to implement measures in the face of the extreme rise in diesel prices, which has reached an average record value of over 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysée Palace press spokesman David Martinon, “the president will discuss possible solutions with them to help their companies become competitive again, and to secure workplace conditions and the pay of seafarers.”
Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused blockades of nearly ten kilometres in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le did not break down.
The Quiberon Peninsula was demarcated by a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tyres and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the canal, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishermen did not exit, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique in the evening unveiled the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the progress of the meeting on Wednesday in the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen will not give up' and 'do not want to go to Paris', for example, announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from Butch Cassidy and the Kid died at the age of 83 from the consequences of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes said goodbye to film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the threat of recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is holding its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 delivered aircraft, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the size of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving up more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering giving over 15% of its assets to repay the <0x24>85 billion that was allocated to it.
AIG is ready to regulate the sale of most of its businesses, beyond its international life insurance and retirement pensions in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to verify possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained with the AIG.
Among the assets that AIG might be separating from are its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsured Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity.
As regards these sales, no final decision has been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must make sales at the earliest in order to repay the loans over 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the U.S. authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will lose to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to save the banks, a historic fall in the exchange rate: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of approximately 800 points, and the Sunday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest fall in its history (684.81 points) was recorded earlier on September 17, 2001, the day of the decline in trade following the September 11 attacks.
According to the final scores, the Nasdag index, mainly related to technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widespread Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks by the House of Representatives, which was again to allow some stability in the markets, the Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, MEPs refused the funds he had asked for.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“Here is a bad picture circulating that represents Congress as unable to adopt a plan,” Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would be 'too late'.
“If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, cited as Red.) and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would further restrict credit conditions,” Brian Bethune, a global economist, said in a statement.
And Miss Piegza stressed, stressing the feeling of extreme urgency even more, that "every day that passes away brings the ruin of a financial company" to the United States.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, U.S. authorities planned to purchase the banking operations of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are 'not just facing an American but a global crisis', according to Anacialti.
The market for basic necessities has grown considerably.
The revenues of the Treasury within ten years fell from 3.632% on Friday evening to 3.827%, and the revenues within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama wins by points in first television duel
The first debate of the two White House candidates was followed by another to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, both Republicans and Democrats announced their own victory in this television duel, which should be pursued by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite apparent, was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the election questions five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, which according to Obama is five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
Among the still indecisive voters, those who are now concerned, Obama emerged as a winner with 39% of the polls, while according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as a winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected of his competitor Joseph Biden in his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not stop to put his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy to the forefront, while clearly emphasizing his opponent’s ‘naïveness’ on these issues that were the focus of this first television duel.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he stressed several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
A point of attack that has been preached in Republican polling stations since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and accurately, without letting himself come out of the version.
He put his ability at the forefront of making good decisions and renewing the image the world has of the United States.
“McCain still didn’t understand, on the other hand, that Obama already did,” a democratic election joke was set this weekend in which Republicans were accused of not capturing the full extent of the crisis that is burdening the ‘Americans off the street’.
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in a speech yesterday in front of 20,000 people who gathered during an election event in North Carolina in torrential rain.
He didn’t even mention the words ‘middle class’ or ‘workers’.’ The financial crisis gives Obama a clear advantage, which the Americans consider best suited to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss.
"The coming week could be a decisive turning point," influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.”
Once again stressing that he would probably even be able to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of a system of renewable energies, together with the introduction of a policy of renewal of energies.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully ignored the questions raised on the <0x24>700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) plan to save the financial market, which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
“Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?”
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday night since the closure of polling stations on the Minsk market square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous youths had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukashenko: ‘The dictator is to step down’.
Some admit that they didn’t vote at all: ‘What’s the use of it if they do with my voice what they want,’ says a young woman.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to carry out a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the non-participation of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
“We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the countdown,” said Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter the parliament, then because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their involvement in Parliament can mean broadcast time on television, meetings in the regions, and legislative proposals."
The opposition is therefore obliged to intervene in the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, falls into a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
“We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, will not recognize the election as valid.
She stresses that the electoral participation figures appear too high, and that the expansion of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that an election has taken place?” asks Social Democrats leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those most likely to conform to the ideas of the government.'
The silence of the night descends again over the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Understanding - From the Blood that Became Safe Again
Hema-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be delighted, as Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained public trust, which was severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross donation service were infected with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and to elaborate guidelines on this type of cataclysm.
While Judge Krever was still reluctant to submit his report, several provinces set up a committee to develop a new system for the management of blood preservatives in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
According to reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Québec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society to provide for the other provinces and the two territories.
“In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started her work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood preservation system in Quebec,” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preservatives and by working in this field over the next few years, we have regained public trust,” she says, before emphasizing proudly that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that ‘trust is something extremely fragile’.
Since its founding on September 28, 1998, Hema-Québec has been acting on the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine intelligence in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
“And we didn’t have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we are referring to one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which one applies exclusion measures if one is not aware of this and if a disease only progresses slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which leads to a degeneration of the brain.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was undoubtedly proven that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the precautionary principle that we applied is quite meaningful.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the Nucleic Acid Tests (NSTs), which allow directly in the blood of the donor to prove the presence of the virus itself, and not that of the antibody against the virus, as was the case in the tests used so far.
The NST allowed to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, has been significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means that you have to distribute 12 million blood preservatives before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preservatives each year, it would take more than 24 years for a case of HIV to be transmitted via a blood preservative.
I believe that you can feel comfortable doing it these days when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore your health,” says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We need to constantly monitor," said Dr. Décary, stressing that Hema-Québec must also provide adequate supply in addition to a safe supply.
“Needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
As treatments for cancer are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also affects the blood donor network, which, on average, only 3% of Quebec’s people are eligible for blood donation.
Any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the fitness criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because they are ill with, for example, AIDS or malaria, and those who travel to a country where malaria is widespread are excluded from blood donation for one year.
With this 3%, we manage to get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you need to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and make them become regular donors.
“Life is so hectic nowadays that you rarely find time to spend an hour donating blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of <0x24>297 million, Hema-Québec delivers not only blood preservatives but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyelids and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being interposed at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank in Quebec.
In the navel cord, which was previously considered a biomedical waste, there is rich blood in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth navel cord blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand annually.
“We should probably start by the beginning of next year by making it available for transplants,” explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program as very popular.
‘Many mothers are convinced that they do not have access to it’, as Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal's impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle sounders at the second and decide game of the quarter-finals series at Saputo Stadium, where the overall turnout was counted, for the semi-finals of the qualifying matches.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the nineteenth minute.
After a first half without a goal for both the one and the other side, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for the Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the sounders.
Remember, on Friday, Impact brought a 2-to-1 defeat to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle.
In the semi-finals, impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night, Thunder was able to offset a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 wins, but the Whitecaps went into the semi-finals with a total score of 5 to 4 nonetheless.
Impact will probably face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The Canadian team's number 1-trio is ready to take on the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostisyn led the attack on the Florida Panther with a storm fire leading to a 3-2 victory.
Kostisyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two sets and Kovalev transformed a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev achieved the victory by firing the only gate of the whole shootout.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable."
“He’s fixed himself too much on it in the first half,” Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause."
Charest bets on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out opening elections even before the end of the year.
As soon as the Liberal Party’s general assembly was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today’s election.
'Delaying the course of our last major border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following entirely the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of painting mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mining plants, from Quebec looked at in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great funds as during the election period.
In contrast to the press, the prime minister refused to exclude that he would hold the elections this autumn, even though he had made it clear that his schedule was very full.
The ‘Plan Nord’ is the fourth element of a ‘vision’ that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a ‘new economic space’ that provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches lately, the opening of the North - the northern area at the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explain why the North is “a jewel with enormous potential”, but did not specify a date, no investment sums or exact priorities for the upcoming projects.
At the very least, some perspectives on what more could be worked on: especially in water energy, in the forests, but especially in the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charest's list, the North has 'Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `Area twice as large as France' `is near us, is in Quebec.
It’s not just near us, it’s within us’, he stressed, how to clearly show that he’s looking to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown greatly through its connection with the North, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it’s our future,” he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, the prime minister told the press.
“This is a traditional attitude pursued by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity comes, I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
"With climate change, we have to rethink our vision from the north," he said, speaking about the northwest passage, which will be accessible all year round due to the melting of ice.
In view of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is an obligation to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said the Quebec government would be very cautious about them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly a speedy deputy from Ungava) have already initiated discussions in about thirty communities.
A committee of ministers led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Land Treasures) occupies an important place, has begun the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, ‘not necessarily a summit,’ but an opportunity where ‘one will create a common vision’.
Moreover, the development of the North will be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this ‘vision’ as a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
“Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have rethinked to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
This was, by the way, one of the themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s takeover of the party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the power plant of Beauharnois to Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, through readings that reached the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” said Jean Charest.
In the face of the press, he referred to another, this time conservative project, the 'Roads to the North' program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stresses that it is scheduled for 2012.
'That remains among us, but I am about to be there,' he confided to his party members, which resulted in those applause storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has in fact not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible for him by law.
However, he stresses that his schedule is full, mainly because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly on the weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially from 'constitutional goals', which were adopted without further ado: the PLQ specifically calls for the recognition of the 'specificity of Quebec' in the Constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunication Council, and that they have a veto on the decisions made in Quebec.
From the sides of the opposition, the guidelines of the Nord Plan were included with skepticism.
The leader of the Québécois Party, Pauline Marois, has re-established the policy for the development of Northern Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If she had done it, 'we would have been much further today', said Marois, alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption of a North plan by the government.
'But what we want is that this is not just a big idea,' party leader Sébastien Proulx said in a statement to Mario Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - An empty country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (which is ironic) in Harper's cabinet, was the one who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has led an unending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to be covered with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one of all the countries concerned who has not brought home their countryman who was imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things that are being prosecuted happened to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and allows a child soldier to vegetate in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a judicial parody to assess the guilt of the defendant.
Let us remember that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers advocate for bringing Omar Khadr home so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes to torture: it is of little interest to her that, after so many years of suffering, a young adult will surely be mentally broken forever.
We are not aware of it yet, but we are experiencing here a slight cut of our rights, our freedoms and our 'democracy', that word that Harper is constantly carrying like a flag in front of him, and that sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morale anymore: a Canadian citizen may be arbitrarily abused, tortured, and detained, according to the goodwill of a head of government, who is supported only by a minority to this day (may he belong to the minority entirely after October 14th...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law, and order, but they do not see that this government has detached itself from what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this release, and nowhere else.
Free Speech - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an orwellian logic that the world’s largest gold mining company aimed to open a “public transparent debate” in an impeachment lawsuit of over six million against three authors and a small publishing house.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge about the truth, especially in the case of slander charges, but about the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to throw everyone into the ruins who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the process goes, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the gold mines.
The tactics in these unequal fights, by the way, are often to ruin the defenders in order to enforce a coercive arrangement that kills the other side and also discourages anyone who dares to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is going on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually carried out by the exchange of ideas and not by bumps.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and records and opened up a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent audit teams that could have brought light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to have any confidence in public opinion and deletes the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could ask for a ‘public’ debate at the same time, but at the same time ignored the opinions of this public?
Apparently, this word in the world of the Vice-President includes only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a context that many perceive as a “kneeling complaint” (in the course of the “public debate”).
Apart from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrick Gold case is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and finding the truth that is fundamental to any democratic society.
She completely denies the right to cite credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that the wealthy companies of this world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has known for a long time to tackle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take action to limit this kind of unjustified lawsuits.
Rescue Action for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans Understand
The Bush administration and its leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the <0x24>700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be adopted by the two chambers of Congress.
The main contents are: a better control of Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public funds used, new provisions to curb the number of houses owed due to payments in arrears, as well as the right to be monitored by the companies to pay the salaries.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Senator Judd Gregg, who attended the negotiations, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day marathon.
“We have made great progress towards a deal that will be market-efficient,” said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
“Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street price crisis,” she said.
“This is the basic point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and unrest in Americans’ daily lives will be huge,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated over the past two hours, fearing the effect of a renewed failure on the mood of investors.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates, who did not take part in the negotiations until late, were more like supporters of the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that they had to be met in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain arrangements to agree, especially those designed to allow owners to keep their homes, and those related to the salaries of the executives of the state-rescued companies.
`If you ask the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain persons, that is not something you can congratulate on.
But these measures are necessary," he said on U.S. television.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied, “I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
“The guidelines I have read [show] that this is a thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of not doing anything at all is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The <0x24>700 billion plan is aimed at, with taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the plastering of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of the risky mortgage loans (subprime) before expanding to other forms of widespread bonds (PCAAs), and finally into a freezing of the financial force and in the ruins of the bank.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed the first attempt at a deal last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain `toxic' assets of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not bought, it is believed to escape the slippery slope.
In order to round up the viewpoint for everyone in Congress, a provision has also been added that if the government is to make losses with this program within five years, it will then be able to raise new taxes in order to get back its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of <0x24>250 billion, which can add another <0x24>100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another <0x24>350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the backed-up companies that will bring him dividends in case of winning, and that can sell it back when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the loaning procedures in respect of the apartments bound by the loans to real estate covered by this plan, and also to set deadlines for reimbursement and loans to be paid to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would have liked the House of Representatives to vote on him today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday, more votes were raised against this project, both by Republicans and Democrats.
“Obviously Washington doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garett, a member of the House’s Finance Commission, told voters.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists in asking the taxpayers to the cashier.”
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, leader of a congressional group called the ‘caucasus of skeptics’, represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to inform us: We ask Congress not to put pressure on itself, and carefully consider which path to take,” he said.
At the same time, we were once again given proof in Europe that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (<0x24>16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would give up buying its competitor, which is in great difficulty, since it has loaned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion (<0x24>2.9 billion) through the risk of the crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, we get a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savings and households appreciate now that unsafe times are coming.”
During this time, on the other side of the Sleeve Canal, the British government was just about to nationalize another bank that had been afflicted by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which over 41 billion (<0x24>75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and the bank’s customer accounts.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to be nationalized by the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a Committed Icon
His beauty with his blue eyes was his Trumpf for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His feeble feeling, his sensitivity and his obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly frightening monster to the world.
But what a great permanent runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from the consequences of lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the canvas, more cautious in his play, certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the splash of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots should arise one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate quality feature.
For in him reflected a whole country that was in love with the self-made man, the fighter who was wounded in the Pacific War in battle, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s, and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York, before also seeing success in the bass, theater and Fer.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became Man’s second 24-hour race in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he has lived in a show relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also disappear the unknown facets of this mysterious, restraining, committed and oversensitive star of showbusiness, whose puzzles can never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans moved cinema lovers to Taumel this weekend, while on the dark screen of the memories all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with him.
There again the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) pushes into memory, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot sheet metal roof filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It is called a much shorter recollection (1990) that wakes up to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed in his old age by a wedding that did not fulfill all of his promises.
There were so many Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean after his death, was re-recorded and made the Newman famous in 1956.
This sympathetic Ganove in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded an Oscar for best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in The Wonderful Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, it was him.
He's still there.
In his life cycle, epochs unite.
He is known primarily from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little-orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers in 1994.
With a final role in 2003 as the father of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several movie legends who have withdrawn early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortunes, his prunk, and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to ‘underplaying’ when he judged his too expressive performances.
The job was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles had only flown for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurologists, alcoholics, fieslings or desperates, with whose perfect representation he reflected his smoothness and resentment.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true delicate sensitivity.
His 1968 Rachel (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott due to an overdose, dedicated this 1984 to his film Harry and Son, a work of feebleness and sadness.
During the flood of honors that erupted over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former gunman Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: “His present has captured my life and this land.”
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the demolition of Hollywood, is now going there.
We have seen him often standing with his feet in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this was considered quite tasteless, although we found it funny at first.
The profits from his sales, however, fell into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shooting.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these sentences: `Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here."
And for us it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Supplement & amp; Co.?
On October 8, negotiations in the criminal proceedings against Jáno’s surcharge and his accomplices will begin.
In particular, the accused is accused of involvement in organised crime, as well as gross negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal offences - including falsification of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the funds obtained from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often covered by fake invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - totalling HUF 65 million - are intended to be partly transferred to the cash registers of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation, partly to the private cash registers of individuals.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when dealing with the tender funds, and the associations are not expected to comply with their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices have been counterfeited.
The invoice blocks were purchased at the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was decided on the round trip north of the Plattensee, to which István Lados was sent by János Supplement.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find guesthouses and restaurants.
He demanded invoices on consumption in order to later issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the self-government of Budapest based on these templates.
These invoices were supposed to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer venue.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Supplement and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company is expected to have visited the nineteenth group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the head of the company indicates that such a large group would not have entered the premises at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Stiftung Jobb Jö<0xC5><0x91>ótr, later known as the Third millennium, also revealed serious form and content errors.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, is estimated to have 130 guests.
The imagination of the counterfeiters apparently had no limits, as it was about Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jöj<0xC3><0xA5><0xC3><0xA5>rt and Hoppá, according to the prosecution, did not appear at all.
As CEO Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas of hvg.hu said, it was immediately clear to him that these were fake documents when documents were submitted to him by the prosecutor’s office during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were wrong on the stamp".
Apart from form mistakes, the fact that the plant was supposed to have housed one hundred people after they had a total of eleven rooms that could not afford as many people.
If the invoice was also mentioned, the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The unsuccessful counterfeiters have also refused to verify that the Budapest travel agency they have taken for granted offers exclusive travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary travel on the cash payment invoice, which is also the accounting practice of the company.
As was known in the course of the investigations, they also indicated VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The amount of the VAT was incorrect in the total of four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jöj<0xC3><0xB8><0xC3><0xA5>rt Foundation, since the operation is calculated instead of 25 only 15 percent VAT, but only machine invoices were issued by the employees.
Another mistake, which was undermining the "invoicing companies", was that in a case they had specified "goods export" as a performance, although this is not offered by the company specializing in investment consulting, the prosecutor's office said.
Further form errors - false billing format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the bills issued together with the Third Millennium Foundation, as well as at the XXI Századi Cultural Society and the Biztos Pont could be disclosed as counterfeits.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors refused to ever issue the invoices.
Another "error" is the falsification of HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was in dissolution at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator subsequently stated that they did not have the invoices themselves.
Consciously falsified
The other group of accountants are people who were quite aware that they had to put fictitious invoices.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapest <0xC3><0x81>lapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Foundation Together with the Third <0xC3><0x81>lavérét, in the amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the CEO of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., also currently in liquidation, is said to have also cooperated with supplement and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have the foundation Jobb Jöj<0xC3><0xA5><0xC3><0xA5>rt Alapítvány, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület.
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issuance, which the parties have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly linked to the accused.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postbot of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió Ltd., a fuel and vehicle trading company located in Budapest, but not located there.
In the period from October to December 2005, the company is expected to issue several invoices on the sale of EDV components for a total value of approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the Investigation Authority, the liquidated Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas has been the buyer of these invoices since September 14, 2005.
The company’s managing director was a Romanian, to whom the company documents should also be submitted by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigations, Kubatov has issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to the third Évezredért Alapítvány, and has cashed their own equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are supposed to have been founded by Romanian Maurers on Iván Kubatov’s express wish.
In fact, none of these companies were active, which according to the defendant was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company’s founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the addition, such as Atlasz and Y-generación.
In total, Kubatov is expected to issue 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecutor’s office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice and VAT.
Kubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictional invoices - in this case the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generação and Szövetsèg a Modern Hungary submitted their applications to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but these amounts have been used for foreign purposes.
To conceal this, they have submitted to TMA five fictional invoices of the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were, by the way, secured during the examination of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
The trials are now being held by some defendants with a confession about the procedure of counterfeiting, as they have already been filed before the prosecutor’s office.
It could be a sensation if the main defendant Jáno’s decision to add to a comprehensive confession.
In fact, his previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession remains.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the compensation of the bulk of the HUF 50 million damage incurred, and whether the supplement is willing in return to take responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that the supplement now plays the "insulted" after his attempts to mitigate the detention and house arrest were put on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have done much greater damage with economic offences and have not compensated them, stand free, or at least under house arrest, this option remains denied.
The Psychology of Overwhelmingness – Or Why We Are Ready to Pay More
In the event of increases, buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate the wrong bidder.
Neuroscientists and economists at the University of New York have now managed to discover the neurological and economic fundamentals of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people don't want to be beaten in a competition, such as an increase on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play the lottery while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, however, an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the spine, was measured in the losers of the auction, in which overcoming the opponent plays an essential role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-rewarding" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
To support their thesis, the economists in the research group have additionally employed research to track money.
In this case, three groups should offer against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their efforts.
Another group was also promised a <0x24>15 reward in case they emerged as the winner of the game.
The third group received <0x24>15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was only that the emphasis on one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neuroscientists, the members of the "against losing" group were willing to wager higher than those in the control or "gain" group.
“These findings cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
In fact, the behaviors observed in auctions have so far been justified only with the pleasure of winning or avoiding risk.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation ready," said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to visit the doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, due to the fact that patients often do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the causes and diseases differ from one another.
Depending on the cause, hepatitis viruses spread to two different types: in the case of hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated food or water), in the case of hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, semen or saliva).
Travelers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B anyway, there is no vaccine against virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and fracture.
After that, yellowing occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine dark, and the recovery can take up to two to three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B-caused, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten people are infected with medication.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the trigger destroys the liver cells at home - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients is estimated at 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the pharmacist for the first signs of unknown origin.
Timely recognized, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby banning the risk of infection and preventing the onset of cancer.
September 30th is World Hepatitis Day, the first time in 2004 hosted by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of these chronic liver inflammations caused by viruses, their formation and the importance of early detection.
Do Believers Have Less Pain?
Recent research shows that religious faith acts as a kind of “painful remedy” that is said to have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: It has been investigated to what extent faith in God affects human pain sensitivities, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electroshocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to turn off most of the pain.
By means of brain scanning technology, it could even be proven that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the University participated.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which gave the electroshocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: one painting of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other by Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would cause some kind of religious trance among the faithful, while they chose da Vinci’s image because it was barely different from the other painting and felt soothing.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time received a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages while watching either the religious or the other paintings.
Catholics reported that they had felt "safe" at the sight of the Mother of God as if they were "cared for" and had felt "peace and peace."
While looking at the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo’s work before their eyes.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be produced with other highly effective images among the atheists, you just have to find the corresponding photo.
“We need to find a picture that triggers very positive emotions, such as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing faith should change our personality, and it does so in many cases,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, only the question remains of what effect a Madonna painting of Leonardo or another similar painter would have on the pain management of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can rightfully claim: it is found in people’s pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: it knows where people have spent their holidays, what specialists they go to, and what moves them.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google’s CEOs.
To skeptics who are being targeted by Orwellian horror visions, he makes it clear that they would just overlook the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company’s original goal of “arranging all the information of this world.”
Schmidt said that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still at the beginning of information gathering.
Asked about the status of Quo in five years, Schmidt said that he wished Google would be able to answer questions like “What should I do tomorrow?” or “Which job really suits me?” but software programs are not yet able to do so because they do not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms would be recorded, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save its own search history and later access it, so that the hits can be generated much more accurately later, and based on the same logic, the so-called "recommendations" are based on the products and recommendations of the system, which are based on the system.
However, users are wondering what happens in case of data abuse – “If you look at what I’m doing” – some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that excites fear, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the craving for power that many Internet users encounter in the face of rejection.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the Internet user’s personal rights.
A paradox of this was the recent anti-pedophilia action in Brazil, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected from the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of pedophiles.
However, concerned users with personal rights were still able to breathe in May when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully brought the FBI to court: thus, in the future, Google may not be forced to issue information to the FBI on secret request.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but the list of individual users, and their web and search terms, respectively, have been retained for two months.)
So Google’s image remains controversial: Those who do not want to disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google’s services will blame the company for the outrage it owes to the conservative companies.
Meanwhile, the American “geek culture”, which is present in many countries and attracts enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of “cool entrepreneurs” in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require any identification code to its users, and provides its services free of charge, so an open, constantly updated source and program package seems to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official software practice.
On the other hand, the geeks are exploring the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet sharply - a relationship that has been highlighted especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
In fact, the "Web 2.0" is nothing more than collaboration, i.e., the users deliberately leave traces and benefit from the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average teenager can automatically manage his profile on several community portals at the same time - from Facebook through Xanga, they can connect through other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually put all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed, photosaed, or Blip.fm that can be uploaded to new ones.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at the party photos of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the employee is fired because he has been honestly new to his trouble with the company management.
Anyone who lives an online life is what he praises of himself – so in some ways one could formulate the basic ideas behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even to circumvent Google’s monopoly, can do so – like with Scroogle, a tool that while accessing Google’s search engine, but intentionally leaves no traces.
Not a few people are intentionally registering not on community pages so that they are not found, but also Google’s online applications, such as text processing and graphics tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and therefore may not be able to do so.
Public opinion, on the other hand, is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of <0x24>156 billion, the company even stands in front of IBM (<0x24>140 billion), Intel (<0x24>124 billion) or Coca-Cola (<0x24>110 billion), the AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces are threatening the revenues of advertising agencies, and the increasingly fast-growing Microsoft software providers provide other services.
Critical viewers, however, would also find the disturbing counterpoints: for example, the group management has rejected a protest of the employees completely, after the fees of the company’s own kindergarten have been doubled, and the management of the company, which is against the multiple meals of the employees in 2006, was too expensive for the K, but it must be too expensive for a year.
The internal regulation of the company is that a lot of new services will not be advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could be a bit more severely disruptive: while some of my, Google’s, the “shower and magazines” approach are the problem with the company’s, or the “baseer’s” project.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database already delivers the substance to the next generation of sci-fi authors - for example "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian way a future in which a person is scaryly close thanks to Google data.
Two teens help <0xC3><0x93>zd’s double killer to eradicate traces
In connection with the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, the police have now interrogated two young people suspected of having helped remove the traces, a spokesman for the Police Commissioner Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people were persistent and are currently being charged with aid.
According to the news agency MTI, these are two girls who defend themselves on their own.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was imprisoned on Sunday.
The man is suspected of having deliberately murdered several people out of greed.
In the course of the investigations, it turned out that the 23-year-old had owed a larger sum of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect, however, did not want to pay off his debts, so he attracted his creditors to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act in a long way - this is also evidenced by the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers Purchase for Prague Stock Exchange
Approximately EUR 200 million, or 5 billion Czech kroner, has been offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which the Poles had made despite the fact that they had previously been excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchanges.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the offers of the Poles include the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As reported by the newspaper, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far placed offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he also did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to shareholder agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some of the leading European newspapers spoke on Tuesday from "September 11th".
The global financial disaster we owe to the American president, for example, said "La Repubblica" - the president was not even able to turn his own party behind the bill to one that should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to talk about a “second September 11”.
Parts of the press in Madrid also located the Sinenbock in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to collapse, and the whole world will suffer under it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but now, after a vote in Congress, the threat is that Washington has no political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, for example, the Geneva "day indicator".
While some states could still provide their bankrupt monetary institutions with bailout packages, and save banks with taxpayers’ money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and even more banks are pledging, then no further financial injections or other immediate action will help.
In the long run, EU member states would have to skip their shadows and centralise control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to weakened monetary institutions, the Vienna Standard recalls. Moreover, as the newspaper continues, the concerns are increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers must now also get a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not taken seriously the crisis that is now raging like a tsunami across the old continents.
The "savers" should not immediately "repay" with hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be advisable to maintain in which case it would be reasonable to touch on taxpayers' money to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car simulates the flight of the Hummels
What would be the best method to develop new accident prevention technologies if not to mimic the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, those of the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented, in which the Nissan engineers were inspired by Hummeln to create new accident-preventing systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the auto-robot-driven biomimetic system of type BR23C, a mini-car, equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology PR and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bees, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
To mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers came up with the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board, which immediately initiates the collision-preventing process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of a second, and the autobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by rotating the tyres around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
“If not, the autobot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the “Mobility Laboratory” and the autobot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer, within the accidents still considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, the evasion, unlike the bees, can not take place upwards, downwards, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and that is only in the direction of the rotation of the tyres.
While there are infinite possibilities for the bees to escape from other bees, the researchers were able to use the autobot only the motion of rotation, acceleration and slowdown.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of data, and less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and respond accordingly to them.
It does not have to save them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using previous maneuvers, so it constantly takes only a handful of KB memory.
It does not require gigabytes and megabytes of hard memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision-prevention technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production in series over the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously driving the driver around obstacles and leading him to his destination.
A name for the child who died
Now there is a written version of the <0x24>700 billion heavy bailout package law, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at buying the banks’ bad loans.
In the first half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time East Coast, congressmen broke through a deal on the <0x24>700 billion bailout package after several days of debates, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, and said that the agreement should only be put on paper.
The compromise on the bailout package was supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said the programme will be effective and efficient, but more needs to be done, not to save Wall Street, according to Pelosi, but to tear the economy apart.
The written version of the package was published even before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening at 8 p.m. (Central European time Monday 2 p.m.), but has not triggered a high flight on the stock exchange.
On Monday, the House of Representatives first votes on the 2008 bill to stabilize the economy, then the Senate is in line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
“We are satisfied with the progress made overnight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program, however, deviates from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the <0x24>700 billion should be spent at once on the purchase of fake, loan-loaded securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the <0x24>700 billion amount will be spent, with <0x24>250 billion available immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This amount is intended to be spent on the purchase of credit-loaded, poor securities, and will be spent over <0x24>100 million.
The programme is reviewed by a commission of its own, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the <0x24>700 billion depends on another decision by Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: It can simultaneously purchase bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-loaded securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As officials of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the means of concern, and the companies pay the corresponding fees for the expected damage.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to <0x24>700 billion can be provided as an immediate aid to the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk that will be raised by the collapse of a major financial system.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it has been signed, Paulson said.
However, the managers of the banks in difficulty and now relying on state aid can expect their completions, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slope, to be shortened by the government.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The cut essentially means that if the ministry purchases under an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the served head of the bank is taken to retirement.
In the event of a direct purchase of the wrong loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that managers’ salaries are not exaggerated.
The image also includes that the existing Golden Handshake agreements will not be changed - the restrictions only refer to new agreements, so as to allow more people to participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, the measure.
The state gains participation rights in participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank get better again.
The bill provides for the president to submit to Congress in the next five years a proposal on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect from us, the plan doesn’t protect taxpayers’ money at all, said California Republican Darrell Issa.
His Ohio colleague, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were driven by the same people who were also responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial prices continued to rise
According to the Central Statistics Board, domestic sales prices increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and compared to August 2007, equal to 12.9 percent.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than those in July 2008, and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year.
Due to price changes in the domestic and export sector, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2 percent higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices have only increased slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 per cent.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry have also only increased slightly - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly for bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, while for shoes prices increased by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly pushed prices for chemicals and productions up (1.6%).
Prices decreased in crude oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 per cent) and wood processing (0.1 per cent).
Prices in paper production, as well as in publishing and printing industries remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the major domestic sales markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
If you look at the domestic sales markets of the processing industry in comparison to the year, the prices in crude oil processing have increased the most (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector, an increase of 13.2 percent was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
Prices decreased in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The extent of deforestation in the other processing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
In the domestic retail market, the highest price increase (0.7 percent) was recorded in the investment goods sector in August.
In the manufacturing sector for consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while in the energy and further processing sectors they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reuse sectors (16.8 per cent) compared to the 2007 comparison period.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, a price increase of 6.8 per cent was observed, while investment goods saw a price drop of 1.4 per cent.
Industry export prices measured in Forint increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but compared to the year there was a decrease of 3.9 percent.
The domestic currency was 1.7 percent weaker compared to the euro, 7.1 percent to the dollar, and compared to the August 2007 exchange rate, it was 7.5 percent stronger compared to the euro, even 15.9 percent to the dollar.
No more visas to the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force on January 12, as the foreign minister told representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her opinion, "now everything depends only on whether the electronic immigration or overseas control system is being introduced in time."
She also stressed that there will be no entry permits in the new system, but tourists will have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington from today.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her the "Middle Merit Cross with Stars" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also holds talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain Support Rescue Package for Banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major U.S. parties, pledged their support for the <0x24>700 billion bailout package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians who are demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
The congress and government representatives announced on Sunday that they had reached an agreement on the banking bailout package after days of marathon talks.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the emergence of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain – both claim to be better than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his prominence thanks to economic issues, while McCain High, who gave him the presentation of Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin according to the Republican Convention, is at the same time melting.
At an election campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hopes that Congress will quickly enact the law on the <0x24>700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We need to act now, and responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened," he said before 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to describe McCain’s economic visions as “obsolete.”
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We’ll all have a hard time pushing for that [...] but nothing is definitely an alternative.”
The Republican senator said the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as the restriction of completions for top managers - something he has insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, House spokeswoman Nancy Pelosi said the House of Representatives will likely vote on the bill on Monday.
Preview of the German-speaking space
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-sided German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution Destructs Her Fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epoch breakup is a problem for Christian democracy, as is the case with Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the CSU disaster did not come, but on Sunday something came to an end, which was already quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
As already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, falling for the first time under the 50-percent mark since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the much cited Stoiber era.
The CSU’s consistent modernization in the federal state has ultimately wiped out their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this 40 years ago, but it was significantly appreciated in the pace, but without impact the secularization, the educational success, the entry of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization always goes hand in hand with option multiplication, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact – only voters within the camp have become more critical and voluntarily.
It is noteworthy that in recent weeks the classical citizens’ groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with a bachelor’s degree.
The CSU’s support declined to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its "Who's Who? Party bosses withholding in coalition issues" articles titled on the chaotic domestic policy situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the interference of the SP<0xC3><0x96> in internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens have not yet decided on a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it’s all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely looked at their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> chief Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very likely - in some states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the <0xC3><0x96>VP as vice-chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, voters would have chosen the bowl molter course.
Repeat in this direction is not in question.
Molterer, however, reacted cautiously to red offers.
Cooperation cannot be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tries to interfere in internal concerns of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party is in opposition or into the coalition is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally.
BZ<0xC3><0x96>-Chef Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take on government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóka: The Devil's Circle of Poverty and Segregation Must Be Broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit on Equality of Chances is set up by the French Presidency of the EU.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz Member of the European People's Party, called attention to the segregation of education, which is one of the most serious legal violations perpetrated by Roma children.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Council Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European law enforcement and civil society organisations in the area of equal opportunities.
As the press office of Fidesz MEPs reports, Járóka has pointed out that in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be driven primarily from the labour market due to their low level of education.
"The overwhelming majority of Roma youth have no secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher education degree."
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education is a fundamental human right that plays a key role in enforcing other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
In the view of the Members, it is important that this connection be made as wide a circle as possible - Roma and non-Roma.
For the earlier a Roma pupil starts school, the stronger his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and by means of income and income tax, they make their contribution to national expenditures.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - poor and segregated education must be discontinued," said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, targeted and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the process of desegregation in the education sector, and for this purpose the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
“We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a full-fledged citizen,” Járóka said.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the summit is held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the goals of equality of opportunity and freedom of discrimination at the European level, but also at the national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace in time
The fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the election debacle, no heads ever roll, the staff debates were postponed at the top of the Bavarian CSU.
Party chief Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein are still in office, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the disastrous 17 percent vote loss will be decided at the extraordinary party day last October.
However, the much-soldier duo already made it clear that it does not want to stick to their chairs.
They want to soften the angry faction and the party base, which one day after the "Bayern tsunami" demanded personal consequences in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, the Christian-Social Union, led by Edmund Stoiber, reached 60.7 per cent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only able to secure 43.4 per cent of the vote.
For 46 years, the CSU was a "solitary governor" in Bavaria, producing 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
While the Conservatives remain the decisive force in which the southern federal state is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party’s internal restructurings, the potential successor of Hubers, Vice President and Federal Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which will also be involved with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing “free voters” who will conduct a possible polling call.
An irony of fate is that with the list of "free voters" that Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-storm appearance first used the Huber-Beckstein Duo, then mercilessly guarding the targeted politician.
The CSU leadership is now focusing all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who so far pulled the threads out of the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called September 28 the "worst day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards the CDU - in his view, the CSU would have deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has also contributed a lot to success at the national level in 2005, is not to be re-established with a joint force coup, Merkel cannot become Chancellor again after the September 2009 federal elections.
Merkel, who has not made a heel from her disappointment about the fiasco, believes that the CSU’s land loss will not have a negative impact on the big coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the injured CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no opposition MPs have succeeded in entering the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe this is about the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects that there are violations of the law in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
The legislature of the 10-million-inhabitant state would have been coming out without opposition for decades, but the parliament, called the "United Democratic Forces" (ODS), has had some opposing party gathered before yesterday's elections, seriously hoped that the voters would be "altered" in the election of 2006, and that in the case of Lukashenko's "unbearing"
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Thanks to the rising prices of natural gas imports from Russia, Ukraine is becoming increasingly economically dependent. For the easing of price increases, loans were even taken up, and the country has also anti-selling of the Beltrans gas, the owner of the system of the EU's leading gas pipeline, which the EU has agreed to, with the Russians in its political position, the basis of which they agreed to the Ukraine.
The OECD election evaluation report provided a temporary relaxation, where the emphasis was on the positive movements rather than the shortcomings – such as the exclusion of one-third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD’s quick report criticised the campaign on Monday – which is why opposition members are not expected to appear in the press – and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
In spite of all this, the opposition is able to recognize an improvement in the political system: political prisoners were put on the loose, and Minsk is ready even for smaller confrontations with Moscow, by continuing to recognize the independence of the rebellious Georgian provinces as independent of South Ossetia, the Abkhazians, and the Russians.
“We’ve taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Alexander Milinkewitsch told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to leave only one opposition candidate in parliament".
The opposition is not planning protests against the results, but rather trying to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have to deal with many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of distributing stones, but still I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even the older ones," - said Milinkewitsch in an interview with Herzichter, who said that even the security is not the same.
“Thanks to the country’s debt and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time until the ‘social security’ that is waiting for the silence of a cemetery begins to crack,” Milinkewitsch said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in the actions, not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the officials’ entrances and exits.
Starting today, the measure will come into effect against those slumbers who first stamp out and then go drinking coffee during working hours.
The new “Anti-Faulpelz Act” was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
<0xE3><0x80><0x8C>Driveable doors are a means to increase work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services<0xE3><0x80><0x8D> said Minister Brunetta.
“Now a new era of accountability and transparency begins.
This is reformism,” says Brunetta.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi said: “The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value.”
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is now no breakfast during working hours; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises in this regard with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 a.m. works wonders".
During a meeting of the Supervisory Committee on Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
In a statement from Rome, the minister announced that "within three months, the absence of officials has been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people per year are present at work".
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of public administration in Italy.
"the salary dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as large in the last 8-10 years as the private sector and far beyond the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have gathered to counter the Brunetta Decree as part of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the ministers of public service are profiled with figures about less absenteeism at work - the consumer center writes - the people of the 'acting faul peel' are growing uninterruptedly.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable public service officials have come together to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (ARC) is fighting for additional financial compensation for occupational disease, including the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made and further aspects of the new ministerial appointments.
Napolitano: "Prevention of work accidents is decisive"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For the year 2007, data from the Inail (Istituto Nazionale contra gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were about 1200.
These figures demonstrate the seriousness of a phenomenon that almost doubles the number of deaths caused by murder.
Today, the Association Nationale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will celebrate the 58th National Day for the Victims of Labour Accidents in all the provinces of Italy to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data circulated by Anmil and the tragic news these days confirm the decisiveness of the issue of prevention in the workplace," President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano confirms in his statement to the President of Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilaliti deltrovali ed inlograno).
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of workplaces, to the protection of injured workers, to the support of the families of the victims and to the sensitization of public opinion."
"A mere "Basta" has stood up on this; understandably in the case of tragedies which, measured by their magnitude, trigger some swirl in the media and the participation of the public. But the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can again be in their own dynamism".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly also a resource problem: it must be decisively invested in education and information."
The numerous initiatives aimed at raising more direct awareness in schools are of particular importance to young people who are nurturing the world of work.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness; it is necessary to put in place and improve a legislative standard.
The President of the House, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of labour-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules aimed at ending the problem".
“The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of work-related deaths is too high,” stresses Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention; that's exactly what ends up causing the tragedy."
"How do you believe that you are doing too little to deal with the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight it through different actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – says Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already starting at school.”
"An additional effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and the sensitization of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that is a social emergency is in demand."
Mercandelli also spoke of the "progressive deterioration in protection of the victims of work accidents" and praised the "abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years."
"The goal is therefore to give back to the worker a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or random donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 player under charge: danger of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 player, can lead to permanent hearing loss.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a report published today in Brussels cited the opinion of the EU's CSRSER (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks).
“The report – it says in a note – makes it clear that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years a week for at least an hour a day are at risk of permanent hearing loss.”
“I’m worried that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones on a high volume, will irreversibly damage their hearing without knowing it,” said Meglena Kuneva.
“Scientific findings – it is said by the EU – show a clear risk that pushes too fast action.
What really counts is to raise awareness among consumers and make this information a community.
“In view of these scientific findings, we need to reassess existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology.”
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
"Scientists - concludes the EU Communication - confirm that one is too concerned and that the EU Commission will now, together with the other EU members and stakeholders, examine the necessary measures to better prevent children and young people from being harmed by the noise that comes from portable musical devices and the like.
There is already a European standard, which limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, which is concerned about the damage that could result from a large noise load.
These damages can be very limited, in which solutions such as the reduction of volume and the length of noise exposure are used.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that when users of portable music devices listen to music loudly (over 89 decibels) only five hours a week, the legal limits for the maximum level of noise at work are already exceeded.
Those who transcend this limit risk hearing loss within five years.
That is 5-10% of users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the launching shot to "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, it's supposed to be over in March, and in June the balance sheet is drawn.
This is the process set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which the Commission met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City Council and the City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - stresses Alemanno. "It will make proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose politically responsible city council and municipal council remain.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
It will be completed in March and the Commission will dissolve again, as such a project must have a timely end point.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work carried out by the Commission."
Those who question the competence of the Commission, as their opinion defies commitment, respond to Alemanno: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to look for a longer period of time to work seriously with a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city."
"This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a penny and it will bring us to mind, it will employ the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to take a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus a joint step into the future."
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, "which will not only limit itself to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only in terms of the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here is a statement
A well-known American politician, who has much to do with being considered independent, wrote: “Barack Obama will become the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who through his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relationships with armed Islam (and still does so today as a private man).”
The attacks against Obama are becoming more and more violent, right now, as the elections approach.
A lady from Miami wrote on an internet page: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very ugly: he thinks he will get the highest office in a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
Actually, however, these attacks don’t have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? And then there’s the polls; everyone says Obama will win with a big lead.
Also in this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in its editorial: it is only in the polling booth that we will know who the real American patriot will vote for.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that has been kept hidden until the last time.
“Say what you want, then we’ll decide who we’re going to make our crumbs for, whether for Obama or for McCain.”
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What mistake did Bush make during his tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a step in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush’s weakness.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: You can already feel the cuts in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "murderer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nonetheless, they did not declare to whom the information concerning the competent authorities was really concerned because of the general credibility.
They don’t feel as alone as they used to be.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems arise from the cuts to the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to put the newspaper together.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism from shrinking significantly, as the general public understands it.
A clear but complicated pessimism is fulfilled by the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, it is even 65% among executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction the web is going.
The main publishing groups pave the way to the Internet, which is seen by many as the “killer” of the press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, in the hope that “they bring something good for journalism”.
The biggest crack in American journalism today is between the editor-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters working for them.
56% of editors at national level are confident that their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with “security at work.”
Operating managers who are afraid to lose their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", noted Red.) is always a topical topic in the US.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and internet operators, employers offer as they like and so it becomes a question of take it or leave it.
The editor-in-chief often gets very high wages, but the editor can sometimes only get 10,000 euros per month, pension and insurance funds.
As for the holidays, the thing is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become "diseased" over the course of the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: ROM RIGHT: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROWTH
The President of the Second Chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate agent, who had requested to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was turned into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such allegations (against which the prosecutor’s office had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and obtain evidence accusing him.
The Elite is in Danger
The phenomenon had already emerged a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the <0x24>700 billion White House savings package: a large part of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms yesterday's New York Times edition, which reports how the crisis is ending the Republican Party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored the state institutions and the business community, and those who are opposed to the "neoconservative" and the "neoconservative" in the Washington world, and those who are in the "neoconservative".
This part of the party owes its rise v.a. to the vote of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, but also throughout the West, and perhaps beyond, will be affected by them.
In both the countries and Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events that finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard of the state’s renaissance in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions that have close connections abroad and at the same time manage an immense amount of the assets of private households living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: how to behave towards the affected families, which are also a huge mass of voters.
So the crisis appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have gone so far and lost its right to speak: the EU has given the illuminating proof of this, which, due to its division in various national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common way.
Therefore, everyone is now counting on the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, etc. distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become increasingly serious, only the United States is in an economic position to save itself without foreign aid.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: two conditions that are not to be overestimated – under certain circumstances – which no international organization and no market will be able to resort to in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the State-National element is, by the way, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with one of the most closely related sectors: territoriality.
In a paradoxical way, it is just now, when we were so convinced to have long ago entered a networked whole world, into a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we have to realize at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to the other in the world, but they are still connected to a narrowly described piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, one who has such a territory is advantageous to another who lives in an area without harvesting, waterless or oil-free.
Now I come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief introduction.
Who is the territory, who is the government, who is the politics, who is the leader.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to generate two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge about the need for considered leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disarmament over the existing guided tours, including those of the economy, which have emerged as insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper richness and, in a certain sense, still disturbing aspect: a loss of trust, an innocence, a picture of unintentionality, a sense of distance, all aimed at a whole class of managers of Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that the conviction among a large part of the population is to pave the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary represents the majority as always foreign and superior.
The demand for leadership also feeds much underground a branched but powerful movement of the dismantling of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in the unforeseen "revolution" of the voters and in the unprecedented shift of the collective mood here, against the rich state of mind in the <0xC3><0x96>talatic of the last time.
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and less understanding problems and therefore less representative value regarding what is still being discussed today in the lower strata of the financial system and in the lower strata of the West.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
Keeping your eyes wide open, however, is certainly not.
The super sticker that lets the walls go up
Overcoming the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and being able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which is now apparently almost reached the target.
With a glue applied on an area of only 2.5 qcm, the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of adhesive can be imagined as a series of spaghetti-arranged tubes,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic deer that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests carried out with various materials such as glass teflon and grinding paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the resilience of the reptiles’ feet and at the same time “simplely removes the wall,” says Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering Dayton University.
"This material could be used as a passable adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but the researchers are thinking of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also the conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the field of space.
For the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
The Other Art of Research – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new kind of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, California scientists present a microfiber adhesive that cleanses itself from dust by moving on a surface, thus always retaining perfect adhesion.
Medications: Never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness in summer, can cause serious health damage if taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the body’s intake of these.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packaged as well as fresh fruit juices associated with medication intake. During the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again sounded an alarm: it is enough to take a glass of apple-, orange- or grapefruit-
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents to toxic levels.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS – In a report two years ago, the same drug agency warned doctors and patients of the dangers of this mixture, and stressed to pay attention to what is being consumed in conjunction with drugs such as diazepan or methadone.
IT IS NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit medicines.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano, said: “These results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still uncertainties, not to have any hesitation to ask a pharmacist or doctor," the expert of the Ansa agency stresses.
The Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trading patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times guide article that this second event was more decisive for U.S. history than the attacks.
A prediction that received not a lot of polemics as an answer and was kept to the economist even years later, but now proves to be quite right.
“I’m surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public perspective,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the Bush administration's excessive liberalism."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; the open source software is gaining an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration as a freelance replacement for Microsoft Office.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some new features to the public: in addition to a revised and now Spartan-designed start-up menu, it is finally one of the main compatibility for Mac, as well as the new OS operating system, the DoOD.
In addition, attention was paid to compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes e.g. sending via email easier, including the possibility of importing PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time the original appearance of the page.
This allows you to also generate "hybrid" PDF files, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most enhanced elements of the application: tables can now be processed in multiple hands by different users, thereby avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each processor is assigned a task to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently publishing various features of OpenOffice on the internet (on the cloud), while the final result is expected to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available at the following download link: http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, so it follows the English version that has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
However, if free will can be a stimulus for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also in the area of business where OpenOffice could be the big hit: after all, various public administrations and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means an optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word-related text creation program; Calc, the table program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, to create presentations like with Powerpoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of the more familiar access; and lastly, a drawing.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded by 3 million and 600 thousand already achieved.
Kohl tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens in the framework of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third-classer and winner of the best climber’s shirt.
The news published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver to be tested positive for Cera, the third generation Epo, which has already been tested by Italians Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in the last weeks by the Labs Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter trials now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French Anti-Doping Commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive epoch test, and according to the Associated Press also notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the best climber’s shirt for himself.
THEMA INVESTIGATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTED: IS ITALY RASSISTING?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only admitted with resentment.
Does this make Belpaese a nation of racists? Asks the New York Times in a long article devoted entirely to the topic of racism in Italy and based on the case of the young Burkina Faso-born Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he had a packet of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those where "most integration and employment opportunities exist", and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiment and the greatest support of the Lega North is to be recorded".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the League against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also being cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underscores the pope and the president: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The student housing market is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, the rental union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious trains. In fact, a whole bunch of students are losing their right to study because their families are unable to support them at this level," says Laura Mariani, the head of the Sunia market, "in these cities, Laura Mariani has also led to the great demand of the other sides of the student.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, without rental price limits, unauthorized rentals.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures that result in a revision of taxation to lower rental prices.
A closer look at the survey shows that in Milan a sleeper in the Brianza district is required about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Nere Bande district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros for a bed of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighbourhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rentals in the neighbourhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who wander outside can save money: 300 euros for a sleeper and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeper, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeper costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting out-of-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
Historical cinemas close due to the favoured multiplexkinos.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This image of director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of the exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-sala complex in the periphery, in the long run means the death of the one-sala cinema in the center. A process that not only appears irreversible and irreversible, but also the trains of a cultural crime.
Mostly affected are historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom you have left a piece of street full of emotion," said the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which gave him the Oscar and the grand prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It's always in Novalja, where it's best for Kiestalgia and the history of a suburban dekin.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a distinct language: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these things paid for most of the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, 6 in Bologna, and Nealog.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years Lombardy is leading the list, 81 are in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has evolved in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "although it is useful that new structures also arise, but in the first place is the preservation of the already existing, because a multi room in the city is closed, not all are ready for the establishment, all of its stamps are ready.
And here is the missing state for the trade union fund: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral standpoint that the government does not respect the existing laws.
To keep the sector going, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be needed".
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to have decided to protect the old cinemas by means of an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; this is the first agreement of its kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support the traditional cinemas as well as the center of the Zen, and thus in the history of the city.
The measures envisaged include tax advantages for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in terms of transport: it will be allowed to drive to the restricted areas of the centre and also to park parking at a more favourable rate.
"It is a delightful initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also design new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to align something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because after all, today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to start the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso" even though I have known it for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; when I cross the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to not have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the municipality's decisions to the interests of the Piromalli Mafia group.
The allegations made by the Anti-Mafia Attorney’s Office of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted of engaging in criminal associations of the mafia.
"Without respect to any moral and legal norms," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay lawyer Piromalli money for advisory activities."
“This made it possible for the Mafia group – the judges said – to officially invade the town halls and co-determine the policy of public administration.”
The chairman of the regional committee of Calabria, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "there is nothing but an exception to encountering connections from local administrations and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which according to the police the clan Piromalli was decapitated.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and even then due to apparent links between organized crime and local administration – the local politicians of their municipal offices had been disbanded.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the mid-right coalition after the election in May 2006.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipality.
He pointed to Vice Minister of Interior Marco Minniti, whom he referred to as having invented everything for political and strategic reasons, but in connection with this morning’s arrest warrant, the judges explained that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
From an interrogation in connection with the investigations of the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to respond to the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus making the measures of the public administration identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes from the waves, suddenly the big ones run up.
It is a non-successful source of money that covers over 70% of the planet’s surface, and it is only now that the world’s major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been under consideration and researched for 70 years; not by chance, these studies have increased significantly since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke in 1980, the idea of marine energy was distorted, but now environmental organisations and the rise in oil prices are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by ocean waves.
This is equivalent to double the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
There are also the currents and tides.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy sector are now relying on marine energy production.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” said a spokesman for a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering the opportunity to work with us.”
This is about acquiring an approval from the U.S. Energy Commission necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially considering that it is in Alaska that oil is still being promoted by the United States and President Bush recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the New York-based companies Debt Power Inc. and Ocean Power, New Jersey, are also investing in the new industry; the details are not known, however, observers say.
Nonetheless, there are technologies that can be improved.
Experts speak of a technology that is still on the rise, not least because the last doubts of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are quite small and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a much greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are different ways: Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected bows.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the bows up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the float via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater pipes.
So far, there are four planned installations of this type, which are still pending state approval, and some of the energy generated could also be used for military facilities.
Debt Power, however, already produces energy for a warehouse and a parking lot using undersea turbines in New York’s East River.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feeds the generator through the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential customers is already awaiting the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electrical Research, there is a particular interest in the potential that lies in the tides.
While this is also an irregular phenomenon, tides are more predictable than wind currents, sunlight and waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely tidal energy that led states like New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest <0x24>7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
