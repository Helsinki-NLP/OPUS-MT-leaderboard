The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ’s stock transactions reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday’s fall when it fell to about 6%.
The decline this time is due to the drop in stocks in Wall Street.
It also expresses the market's reaction to the outcome of the vote by the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the Secretary of the Financial Sector's stabilization plan.
Fall of shares in Asia
Asian stocks on Tuesday experienced a dramatic drop, although throughout the day the index eventually mitigated some of the losses.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Stock Exchange index throughout its financial day was nearly four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows Chinese stock movements on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell by 3.8 percent, markets in Shanghai were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange’s shares lost more than five percent but in the end, the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange fell to 3.6 percent, according to the index secretary.
“Planned bailouts in the U.S. are unsafe and this affects the financial market around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong’s interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bathing of American stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system, to which <0x24>700 billion (almost <0x24>12 trillion) should be allocated.
Legislators, in this way, ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloody bath and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to almost seven percent, with a similar volume drop last recorded in 1987.
The index dropped already before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal did not go ahead, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: U.S. government may inject <0x24>700 billion into bank
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers sparked a gap in talks over the approval of the bailout plan in its form of aid to the U.S. financial system with the amount of <0x24>700 billion (approximately <0x24>12 trillion).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must refine some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law public and vote.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and the Assembly Bank, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, it will come to "disenchantment" thanks to the complex mechanisms whose help to the market will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a great progress.
We resolve our divergent opinions about the way the package of market stabilization measures should be," Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met on Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive shape to the Government Fund.
This should buy from financial corporations the unsold mortgage assets that lead to financial corporations to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are about to conclude the agreement on the plan, which will work and should also be effective in the market.
It is necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already in it,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis explicitly affects the stock market that is falling rapidly.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing their best to make Congress definitively approve an agreement on Sunday.
They want to soothe investors’ business in front of the Asian financial market as these are the ones that are in the first timing hurdle and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now, there is nothing clear with certainty about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and, even if they do not stall at the last minute with any problem.
Legislators believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion have to be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, which would be another <0x24>100 billion and, later, the last <0x24>350 billion.
Bush Appreciated the Advancement of Meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can outperform his veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to earn financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything.
The House of Representatives should be ready to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is pleased with Saturday’s advance and that he values “both sides’ efforts to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy.”
Limitation of the Armored Contract
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said the legislators decided on the responsibility of the money program to protect taxpayers’ taxes from their losses, a relaxing closure of the planned finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of participating companies, and set up a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This should be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on this, and we’ve made a great progress towards a deal that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly payloads of debtors on time and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but rather difficult.
“And that’s why it’s not known with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the server iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week is not as relevant, Marek said.
"More importantly, this week, Congressmen agree on their support and give them their good views as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to get that approval is, at the moment, the most important thing,” Marek said.
Armed Fight: The MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
What seems clear is that it is better to buy only the phone.
Still, there are enough reasons for the man to acquire only the reproductor.
The choice depends practically on the way it is used and the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern records to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album on it.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LP discs no longer come out, and in terms of their quality there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz, or blues are on your shelves, you’re probably dreaming of at least this kind of records.
This is the same with music that is on the way, that is, compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the twenty crown market helmets.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
Also determines the battery life
Some of the best players get a lot more than just playing music and even what not even most mobile phones.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most basic functions such as calling, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, you have a better or worse camera, and you can even navigate.
And when we consider the Smartphone and the PDAs will have in their pocket also a small computer.
This is a small miracle as no refrigerator can make a grill and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the display indicator will be illuminated asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest drinks of energy.
There are few mobile phones that can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly have higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobile phones will not play for more than two hours.
If in addition to this, above, they constantly call themselves still, for more safety, a charger for work - this is also true for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the worst can withstand at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem occurs when recording music on your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices have the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unreduced readers can connect the small memory cards that are used on mobiles.
On players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Simply fill the device with music through the USB of the computer.
Most mobile phones and players create their order only in the music library by the name of the performer, album title, genre or also by user rating.
Some devices only show a tree-like directory and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a particular equipment he was interested in the resistance of the accumulator, in the capacity of the memory, in the quality and type of sound output and, of course, in the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you’re going to listen to it every day just for a moment, like on the tram, then you just have to play any mobile phone.
This is what virtually any mobile can do.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the phone or player plays the music.
The MP3 plays it all and virtually all of the music you get will be in this format.
It is among the most widely used and with the exception of it the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The least included the AAC format (format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
Simply use the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could by itself be just a weight argument for acquiring a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is miserable and most is limited only to the leaky success themes of the radios.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a mobile phone.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you’ll find the mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be its price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headphone input.
The best, even when it comes to the technical part, such as phones equipped with an input of 3.5 mm. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really handles them by anyone.
Minimum functions, their handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the touch discs is evident.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that we mistakenly connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, giant account for data download.
Which Apparatus to Decide
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card it will reach the 2,000 kroner.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually only equipped with a 2 GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy still a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) it is not necessary to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding music lovers, take the hands of the most specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line mobiles have almost the same use as an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category as price, over the 4,000 kroner, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator capacity (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand quoted most rent brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is already arriving, this year, in the Czech Republic.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer almost all the services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not going to take long to arrive.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>TU) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the whole Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming rates it is likely to come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS that they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that you really want to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, has already said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very hard to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market that brought a prominent price drop to which the classic operators had to react as well.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for these types of operators and that they can succeed.
There is no need to look for examples far too far.
In February of this year we inform you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only half a year later, this operator managed to get more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking there is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, they are enough with far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not bear relatively high costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, these types of virtual operators are usually profiled at low cost – they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that, however, are often countered by the offer of more tailored services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half of the cheap compared to the competition.
However, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland can also be a good blow to bet on a nothing trivial target group.
This operator is directed specifically to the man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking – it’s the operator he likes and who he can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works for this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as Poland could encroach on our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the service offering is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
“We’re talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it doesn’t seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region,” Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for Penta Financial Group, said in a telephone conversation for mobile.cz.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, they try to do their best to avoid any potential competition.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Nowera group who would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
“We have a great interest in this, in order to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile phone services.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility, we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have been able to move forward in the meetings," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe there are better times.
It seems that, by informal information, the first official operator would probably have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At the moment, we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field," said Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market refers to other operators.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional compliance with O2’s opinion, adds: “Until now we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop.”
“On the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find a virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table some concrete contract that would be possible to study in such a short time."
Vodafone focuses on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of the cost and infrastructure distribution.
We consider it to be the biggest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field is to partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on mobile.”
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a fall in prices and thereby a fall in profits.
So why make it easier to enter the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull from the same rope, proof of that is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>TU was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile company.
This is confirmed by the public information available on the <0xC4><0x8C>TU website.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: “In addition, it has not been long since the competitive environment in the mobile market was opened to a fourth operator.
With regard to the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would mean for him and, above all, for his services, great demands."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of the <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in trade tenders, unlike the UK and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Trade Tenders (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, she expressed her typical stance on this issue.
“The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after a lease agreement on the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator was concluded.
To date, no agreement has been concluded since the offer of the potential stakeholders was not interesting enough for the classic operators,” added Kristián Chalupa, from the Department of Foreign Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS, to our question.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, apart from that, they must note that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Particularly when Kristián Chalupa adds: “In abroad where virtual operators operate normally we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the fall in prices of mobile phone services”
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and the price drop are not in the interest of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
The truly dramatically shocking thing in this case lies in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it is really a coincidence is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in gas stations as it is clear that it is the work of chance and of a fierce struggle for competition.
"The Office has found no signs of unfair competition in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position therefore do not have a corresponding increase in liability in their market performance.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as are telecommunications regulators,” Chalupa added.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many conflicting points.
Obviously, there is a relevant market analysis drawn up by the <0xC4><0x8C>TU that telecommunications are a single market from the point of view of the commercial tender.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech traders have a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another view - for a virtual operator to emerge is always necessary the agreement with the network administrator.
And the mobile operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS should represent a warning that three mobile operators are ascending in a similar way.
The current complaints of the interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera company) show that in all negotiations with the operators they collide with many similar obstacles.
Loading responsibility in the <0xC4><0x8C>TU is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications, of which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes hands in all this matter.
We have already met with him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act for the expansion of the <0xC4><0x8C>TU’s competence in the field of non-effective trade tenders was recently introduced, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
<0xC3><0x9A>OHS representatives should know this perfectly, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
Everything is fine, when no one looks
At the same time, something like a pseudovirtual operator still works unnoticed that in Czech mobile networks already exist a few.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services that, however, are only a part of the public.
These are usually companies that are dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few chosen get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the same by ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the trade conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit this type of resale.
“If cases such as those cited could be found, there could be a violation of the terms of the contract which could be translated into the end of the collaboration with the given society,” Martina Kemrová answered the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile operators would not reach people responsible.
It is precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned above that it can reach thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they get nothing negligible profits and, at the same time – unlike authentic virtual operators – in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns us of possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a demeaningly large percentage of customers.
These, in addition, must accept that your phone’s SIM card is not in your name so they cannot absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of the operators.”
This is exactly what the <0xC4><0x8C>TU should look like a little bit strange.
There is also a new question for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators surround the eyes in this type of procedure, why block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want it should not be content with the operators’ explanations that they have no idea of this story and that their trading conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As has already been made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market brought a significant drop in service prices.
At the same time, in virtually every country where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators tried to protect themselves more or less from this breakthrough.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with service quality, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have intervened at this time and in no case have defended the operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure they managed to emerge the first virtual operator and with it began to emerge more.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body all of this case happens as if it were a burning nail.
In our experience, we can not fail to impress that the confusion of assignments in these cases suits them.
But we will not despair.
If this background information is correct and the virtual operator really gets to these lands, then the Czech mobile market is likely to start moving again.
If one of the operators lets a virtual mobile operator enter, it will be difficult for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek on the occasion of the day of official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the hymn Where, My Home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one in male voice and one in female voice, one with choir and one instrumental.
Del canto is commissioned by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers this Czech national anthem as one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio said earlier that it deliberately chose solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, too, with the choir to fix themselves in the diction so that the text is well understood, so that it has consonance," he said.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home first sounded in 1834 on the boards of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>krup.
He gained popularity and people made it his own.
The first stanza of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
The Prague MHD takes us Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it is written in the history of the Prague Transportation Company the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can now be purchased by nearly one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card at the information centers and posts of the transport company at the stations of the Metro, Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Holehj, Kaytka, And<0xC4><0x9B>l Rozrov.
Bonds can be purchased from yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who are starting to use the internet as a form of trading, can definitely start to forget about ticketing posts at metro stations, where until now they had to regularly do queues to get out a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged at one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is a window with prepared staff that helps those interested in online purchases and also with the recharge of the bonus purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus on the Opencard in the vending machines located in some metro lobbys.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, remind us of a ticket stamping machine and travelers will probably already have fixed themselves on them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“Now there are five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty,” Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
Electronic bonuses from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the round-trip trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that are mainly used by the inhabitants of the towns of central Bohemia.
“On trains attached to Prague’s integrated transport there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and bonus zone,” said ticket control Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, which sets schedules for Prague’s collective transport.
Circulation buses have their reader cards mounted in the driver’s ticket office.
When entering, it is not only necessary to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany it with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than requesting the driver this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel on round-trip buses and do not remember when the bonus expires can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
Southeasters want to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
In 1945, the German Sudetens demanded that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, supposedly, some groups of German Sudetens turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
It is the result of the letters that are stored in a particular archive and that are now stored in the collection of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov in a letter to the US president request that the return of the "Sumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and we really want his word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators,” the letter reads, signed with “the people who carry the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava in their hearts.”
Given that the union of Czechoslovakia with the Southeast Germans is presumably - according to the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors call in the letter to the American president who assumes <0xC5><0xA0>umava for today and forever under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that without taking into account the opinion of four million people, it surrenders us to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that it absolutely collaborates with the Allies’ victory,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of retaliation from the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president presumably doubted this idea of the Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum on the lands of the forests about whether its inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a little childish to us, according to some specialists, it accurately paints the expectations of the Germans of the southeast then.
Although the Czech Germans had to intuit minimally that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate for the Sudeten some clear form of autonomy.
Others believed that they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
This was in the war, as German of Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, wrapped in the Baltic navy.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in Holstein's prison camp dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that when they returned home, the Czech would be good for them,” said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, believed that on the basis of the Decrees of Benes they would be removed from the Republic.
Don't think - pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could be characterised by the emotional Campaign that decided on Wednesday to launch the Ministry of Transportation in the media.
The minister’s office, Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek, promises to dissuade drivers from dangerous conduct at the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, cinema, internet and in brochures.
It would have to distract the driver from high speed and alcohol at the steering wheel.
And also to remind them that before you start, you tie your belts.
He wants to reach awareness especially of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Essentially human stories that embodied emotions.
And for this we witnessed the "blooded" ads throughout the campaign:
Don't think - pay!
The word "Don't think" is written in capital letters on the registration.
And in a blood vessel is the word "pay".
This should symbolize that man at a time of depravity can come to pay with his own life.
The ads will “fear” viewers by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises to reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been made by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and milk for drivers
"For drivers, the sugar and dairy system is valid.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red light is passed and thus saves time.
The latigo is threatened by a fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says Na Homolce hospital transport psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án.
And that’s why we need an information campaign in the press and mainly a negative advertising, the psychologist says.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will likely soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," he warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of Israel’s interim government, Ehud Olmert, spoke about the restitution of virtually all occupied lands in 1967, i.e. the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that he appeared on Monday in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will necessarily have to return almost all lands (occupied) if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll have a little bit of these lands, but we'll have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the case of restitution Jerusalem would also be included.
“Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs like it happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to hand over a part of Jerusalem,” Olmert pointed out in reference to the two July attacks in the city where there were several dead and dozens of people were killed.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historic place" that is located inside the ancient city.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he later insisted.
Retreat of the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
“I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of the Golan withdrawal,” he warned.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to detach to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hezbollah (the Chita movement), they will have to detach themselves from the permanent support caused by terrorism by Hamas (the Chita movement), al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Yihad (the Holy War) in Iraq.
Post-accident questions: Are azafatas illegal on buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the company Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova, we are asked if the passengers and passengers can move by the bus during the trip.
“If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the azafata’s activity is opposed to the road transit law,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less safe place of the vehicle despite having booked two other places.
However, the bus may have an accident or a sudden braking, and at the exact moment when the azafat distributes the coffee or newspapers.
Here what the role plays is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with pedestrian seats.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses have no places to go on foot, as confirmed by the company’s director, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, to Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was removed and we reached an agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is on the way if they have a seat,” he told us.
Azafata does not know the law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the azafata - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term Vehicle Auditor, whose rights and obligations are not defined,” added the spokesman, Hanzelka.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, thinks, on the contrary, that the law adequately addresses this issue.
"It depends on whether the bus has the permissible approval to have pedestrian sites.
That's all," he says.
Buses are divided among urban areas, where there are places to stand and with limited speed, interurban with places to stand with a higher speed permit and long distances without places to walk, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with a seat belt.
As on the plane, the expert says
BESIP’s transport safety expert, Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín, sees no major problems with the movement of the azaphate on the bus.
“During the development of the journey there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to service on planes.
Not even here is the certainty that the turbulence will come and the azafata can be hit in the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly brakes obviously that the laws of physics are valid.
Same as in an urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of the azafata must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the azafatas service.
It employs two hundred people.
The director, even after the accident, considers that work risky.
“However, by the time I have the impression that the azafata position is risky, then I will suppress it.
The coffee and newspapers can receive it, the passengers, upon entering.
It would even save money,” he says.
In the interest of safety is why Asiana lacks affairs in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We have no azafatas, we are against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a deadly accident,” he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
There was a huge tragedy.
In the accident of the line connecting Naples, a young Pilsen azafata who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus without using the intermittents.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he collided with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the azafata were sold.
"These sites cannot be booked for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the judgement on the girl’s family’s compensation but wait for the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring more precision on the movement of the azafata on the bus, on which 30 experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusion.
They do not devote too much to buses, but rather to the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the journey,” says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activity of the azafatas to pose a significant threat to the safety of passengers," said Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, who said that the control of the safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Düsseldorf’s hope is backed up in Frankfurt
The letter from the West LB’s board of directors to its employees is not lacking in big words.
The merger of Düsseldorf bank units with DEKA bank could form a ‘central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group’, as the letter says, published on Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the 'competence block' with sustainable profitability would enter such business.
In addition, such a merger may be a beginning for subsequent mergers in the field of regional banks.
This is how the text comes to be understood, when a board wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because just like before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only the part of the European Union, but also the Federal Financial Services Monitoring Institute which recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For a long time, also from Frankfurt, much has been said about such a union between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for their investment funds, and the West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, made it clear that he saw no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as the Helaba or the West LB.
But the Board of Directors of the DEKA, now composed of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the Board of Directors to begin negotiations with the West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations are just beginning, as it is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time that the bank’s name, DEKA, is one of the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site, with its 3000 employees.
In 2003, at one point the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhine-Palatinate and with the Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed its opposition to Helaba's participation in the project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of Rhine-Palatinate began a dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But the idea of DEKA merging with other regional banks was always played again and again.
But last but not least, Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba board, said he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of that, it seems more clear that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Well, when the Bavaria parliamentary elections are going to take place, the union of BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For Helaba, that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to rise, Helaba will be missing the partners to do so.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it has excelled much better from the financial crisis that the real estates of Stuttgart and Munich did.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turkey, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided co-existence plans with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the German Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end, the West LB can be broken down, but that, of course, is not the bank’s own desire.
Thus, the letter from the bank’s board of directors also says that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the entire bank.
As the coexistence between unique parts of the bank can be combined with the DEKA, that will show the time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena attends him as his girlfriend, and that’s why everything looks different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter barrel of Kaiser branded beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a handkerchief, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking next to Porta Nuova train station, three buses depart this evening at 23:45, ` direction Munich, the beer party', predictable arrival at 6:30 a.m.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started celebrating at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver-coloured patches, belongs to these buses.
For five years they have come to the Oktoberfest, taking into account that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day on the meadow, at 22.30 the turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to Bavaria’s purity law, health insurance and German guide – Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly tranquility reigns on the bus, travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian registration make another stop on Highway 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group has the scheduled arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others come together, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow hat.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to the Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, “When the doors of the tent are opened, that means to walk!” says Marco in the morning.
"March!" March and occupy the backseats in the campaign store.
“Don’t take the seats in front, because we’re going to block, and everyone with yellow hats don’t sit on the same bench, spread out all over space!”
One litre of beer, Marco's raw beer, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have good tone!
As soon as he leaves his place, he will already be busy!"
Third, "This afternoon at exactly 10:30 you have to get here!" Have you understood?
And now everyone goes to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, up the yellow hats on the trees, traffic signs and even on a poster of the elections of a great Bavarian People’s Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no accurate data on the number of people; these are 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend in Italy.
The Munich police receive assistance from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Red Cross of Bavaria which makes a statistic of the nations present, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and the first place of the Austrians.
The preferred shop of the Italians’ campaign is so called Hofbräuzelt.
The sleepless nights for the creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück said last week.
That the politician would use the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich’s real estate financier, which is listed on the DAX index, receives a <0x24>1 billion loan from a consortium of German banks to resist market turbulence.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to throw interest.
The money comes from private banks as well as public banks.
The cause of this is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a report, state financers with the money that was lent for long-term projects only financed them for a short period- which is now, due to distrust in the markets, no longer possible.
In the first half of the year, the bank’s cash reserve has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, and the equity share has also delayed slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared with the same period last year, continuous financial investment revenues and net profits of financial transactions fell to zero, debtor imposition revenues and some securities also those of the dissolution of credit business provisions tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and high revenues from the reimbursement of the restructuring expenses of the former Depfa Group as well as the interest reimbursement under the federal tax code and the business organized for the consortium’s companies, the negative balance could account for a deficit of about 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state finances were initially lost in speculation with industrial real estate credits, which served as reason for the founding of the Aareal bank.
As much money could not be made from the financing of state projects, Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have an "essential material effect" on the group's consolidated account of losses and profits, it is said very inaccurately.
It is a fact that they have canceled the dividends.
By 2007 they were cancelled at two-thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa, the Hypo Real Estate became an important state and financial finance in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own the client deposits, it turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market compared to other banks.
With the bankruptcy of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which has happened two weeks ago, the grant of interbank credits dropped essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year, the Hypo Real Estate needs nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion to finance part of Defa’s short-term refinancing credit portfolios.
According to the report by Hipo Real Estate, the bank covers with a credit the need for the group’s financing for a short period of time and the company is assured of “the influence of international monetary markets that are now essentially not able to function.”
Other sources say that thanks to this money, refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, chairman of the board of directors of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute of Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) start from the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That has to be expected by the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But due to the dynamics and impossibility of the crisis there is no constancy.
It is even conceivable that there is no need for funding in its entirety.
But the opposite cannot be excluded.
There was a voice that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, so temporary rescue could not at least reassure concerned people.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts are almost unchanged, lending rates according to the position in the property registry are clearly declining.
Above all, the loans of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary are affected and, for that reason, the loans whose maturity exceeds 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments, and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime you can start from retirement amortization within the deadline.
Or something is going to happen, which no one can imagine – the financial crisis is going to overcome in the next 15 months.
But by seeing the cross news about partial staticization, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because creditors will spend nights without sleep, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Still, short-term investors can set the end point and use the newly accounted transport of losses for future tax payments of profit compensation on the change in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls started laughing: “German is totally kawaii!”
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word Mangas - in a report on exchanges she counts Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my way alone, luckily I didn't miss it.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not as strictly fixed as in my home, in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine less twenty a small meeting with the teachers begins, the ‘home room’.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
Also, I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt from my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So, dressed like this, I put myself on the pulpit and tried to say everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this point I was very happy because I had already started studying this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have stitched, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my mangas.
That belongs to the Japanese girl survival vocabulary and means "mona, cute"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone was talking, laughing and asking a lot of questions at the same time – it’s very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the recreation everyone took their Bentos out.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and something like tofu mass meat.
In most cases, I have no idea what this is like in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marinated carrots in the salt, buff!
In Japanese schools, bentos are not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bent made in very artistic mode for a boy and is given it in hopes of getting to know him better during a recreation.
I read about it in my manga-comics.
I am curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?", my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because I'm fascinated."
For years now, I prefer to read manga.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I would travel there.
Also because I have a flake by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is a harsh, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn’t feel lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats also have feelings.
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger is fleeing, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, a scientist in the field of neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can they be controlled if they, acting in the same way as us, feel the same?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years, the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, although we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about feeling and consciousness in general, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as other animals: it kills, escapes or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to infect our subjective experience with that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the brain cortex (due to its participation in short memory and the executive functions that lead behavior).
This large part is much more developed in the case of humans than that of other primates and seems to be lacking absolutely in other creatures.
Given at least the aspects referred to our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the brain cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from other primates.
Another particularity lies in the linguistic nature of man: Because most of his experience is linked to language, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would influence it in such a way that the consciousness of animals, created as any, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is neither measured because it has special hardware, nor is it analyzed by our experiences, then its research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions relate to the content of the consenting experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal consciousness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that’s what happens during the short-memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing passes rather to the neutral correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: Both may be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what about that for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain that is responsible for that is activated, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when brain activity occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
From this point of view, the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of the linguistic nature follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to be able to describe states of others to each other.
For example, Antonio Damas, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations derive from the simple activities of the parts of the brain cortex responsible for body feelings and the brain trunk, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the brain trunk.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can absolutely refer to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons, I can’t go against that, but I think it’s unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control if rats and men behave similarly feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockroach runs away, why is it afraid?
I believe that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That’s true that neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, butterflies on the contrary don’t have at least one brain.
Is the trunk of the brain responsible for sensations?
Even when it is possible to test it for men: how can you test it in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can try it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats rather than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as much as the same is measured in rats and men.
Since I don’t research the language and consciousness of rats as well as sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
It can be said that I don’t see beyond my nose, but I prefer to move forward rather than working permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister, said the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as proof of Ukraine's ability to organize the European Championship alongside Poland," Wasjunik said.
“But that’s not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is a lot to be done in both countries.”
The timetable for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is low.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work very quickly,” said the president of a Ukrainian association, Grigori Surkis.
" UEFA is not going to take our eyes off us."
In Poland a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is “a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
“In a letter, we assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that.”
Only in the last season many clubs in the first division were convicted of declining manipulation to the lower category, eventually also the division board had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid's Angry Attack
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in a private life interview—and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan named her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He's angry and counterattacked.
The Late War of the Two Roses in Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid’s ex-wife: Eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week, in an interview with American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for marriage failure: “Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful.”
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - it tells a story of a marriage's failure.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his appointment as an infidel husband was clear: “It is unheard of how many times Meg tells the stories of our relationship in another version,” the 54-year-old told The New York Daily News.
Among other things, it is very "lamentable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will once again "remember in public the pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after a divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so he ends up with his statements highlighting: “Whatever my life is going on.
I'm happy because I have a wonderful family that's okay."
Prices of airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than last year.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Airline tickets and hotel overnight stays were again made cheap – these are the results of a study by American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company has analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after price increases in the first quarter it found a major change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays at many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased by an average of 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
The trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar rate, which was the reason why "the interest of American tourists in travelling declined."
The decline in hotel prices is also much more noticeable in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and thus beat a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline tickets prices also showed upward trends:
Due to the rise in kerosene prices, Economy-class travellers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for airline tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February, prices rose to 11.9, down to 23.6 percent in the second half.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of the price change is, on the one hand, the rise in the slow economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the air travel market, demand is decreasing.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes air traffic between the U.S. and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit long-haul flights on airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still does not go out to score the tenth-first goal.
Kristoffer Klein very well presented the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Anything I wanted to say exactly by reacting to what happened, I could read it clearly from his lips.
I just knew I was right.
"We need a second goal," whispered Hermann Rieger at the entrance to the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of the attendees were back on their sites.
Rieger was a HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and has a very good reputation as one of those who were part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach sighed with his head and raised his fingers in sign of consent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that wasn't done.
"Today not everything was nice to see," added Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have him "relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his headshot; and also the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all their strength to the weak Hamburg team.
“That was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol said.
On Monday, the Hamburg SV will turn 121 years old.
Saturday will be the viewers had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
It predicts that the partial scores in the table correspond more to the league’s veleness than to the dominance of its HSV.
The quipo with his late forced players such as the Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but the quipo still cannot shine with their successes.
“We need more of feeling and dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the loss of voting
On Wall Street, fear spreads.
The first news about the banks’ bailout failed dropped the Down Jones to 700 points over a period of time.
That was the biggest loss of points for a day in its history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
At 20:30, one of the world’s most important stock barometers listed a 5 percent deficit in 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained at 1548 points.
At the moment the biggest loser in the Dow Jones were American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
The shares of Goldmann Sachs lost almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago a major investor Warren Buffet had been financially involved in the company.
The bailout plan provides resources to buy so-called "podrid" mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid by coup but step by step.
As a compensation for that, the state has to receive stock option receipts for financial partnerships that may be charged during course development to reduce the financial burden of the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and in the U.S. continue to fall
The <0x24>1 billion aid to banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The stock price of the major German bank Hypo Real Estate is low and negatively affects the Dax.
Despite the savings of the financial market projected by the state, the US Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The speculative losses of the shares of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led to the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite bailouts by the federal government and private banks, Munich’s real estate financier’s share for a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and quoted a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
Financial markets around the world have suffered a fall.
The opening of Wall Street in New York City began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s <0x24>700 billion bailout is not enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to be 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue bill, the vote in the Senate may be the first of October.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index after profits fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 units.
After the capital expansion was announced, Arcandor's shares lost in the MDax.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourism consortium announced that the shares in the Thoms Cook company will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing uncertainty for researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity may not be so correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Due to the fact that the fuel pipes are now helving, he is now threatening to die in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver, provokes confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes while they obtain an acceleration using the energy of a planet's gravitational field, for example Earth.
This allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun Ulysses probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected according to the venerable law of gravity.
There are often irregularities in speed.
Suddenly, the probes have a higher or lower speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
It was called the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity describing the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and attempts to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers remained in the universe.
“The reason for the anomaly may be the Dark Matter that may also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known the existence of Dark Matter only for ten years.
It is said to possess the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible, which means that it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
Scientists estimate that dark matter makes up at least one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
As Italy’s foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of ransoms.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The rescue negotiations have already begun.
The Germans always fall back to the attention of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper talks about the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara are released.
The same information is presented by state Egyptian television, Arab television station Al-Arabija and Italian media.
After news of the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24, Franco Frattini, the Italian Foreign Minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
“We now control their health,” Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are well and are in security, state Egyptian television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting prior to the release of the hostages: According to descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue,” the guard said.
It was only about "receive the hostages" when suddenly came "this surprise".
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and detained two of them in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a bailout of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million from Germany; the money had to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the hijackers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the hijackers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the rescue.
The men had to be stopped until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Abused father-in-law 'caused suicide'
According to the court, years of abuse by his stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight charges of indecent assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an investigative study, found that he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court found that Mrs. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and sell her eyes before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working at a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to living in Cornwall.
His niece moved to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had been inflicted twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some of Mrs Rande’s friends had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now looked “emotionally dead,” as if she had “abandoned life.”
In April 2007 her real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in her Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that concludes by saying: "I used to tie her and spit in her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: “You are a very strange fetishist, and for his victim it must have been a terrifying experience, especially when he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even clearer, it is that if she hadn’t done it, the matter probably wouldn’t have ended in the courts.”
He added: “I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie’s father and mother the abuse was on her daughter over the years.
Clearly, she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is certainly the less serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention to investigate.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the sentence had come as a surprise to many in the British administration.
“They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the protection of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official had to be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Service Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about al-Qaeda and the capacity of security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transferred from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of more than 80,000 pounds after the rescue/rescue of the Bradford and Bingley banks.
The government, in fact, provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use savings funds, including the 59 construction companies.
The director general of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it “humble” that societies and their members have to pay.
Eventually, the <0x24>14 trillion loan should be reimbursed after Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
Interim interest, however, is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies were included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that have behaved with prudence... are called to pay today the price of institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and the mediation companies had to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will rise to <0xC2><0xA3>450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Commercial Association of Construction Companies, told the BBC that the situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that institutions that have behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
“We will need to examine all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a relevant price,” Cole added.
The interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest, which can be almost twice as much.
As construction companies are mutual organizations and have no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest rates in their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per liter
The residents of the Jersey tray will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence per liter from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following the research carried out by an advisory firm.
Traders can decide for themselves if they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest milk price had risen before February was in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail on bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the bail application for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His advocates said the court did not grant him bail bail on charges of extortion of 50 million taka (<0x24>729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the many allegations of corruption in charge of him.
His long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is expected in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country’s military-supported government grant him first full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given conditional freedom to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is now unclear what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request for bail bail, claiming that she could not obtain bail because she was already under probation abroad,” said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We are going to bring an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her advocates argued that she needed the freedom under bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to his homeland after October 17, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, backed by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are charged with.
Concerns for the anti-poliomyelitis campaign in Afghanistan
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan have not been able to take advantage of a recent anti-polio vaccination campaign because of the violence of the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces in the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach the children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge to the Competition Commission following the decision that forced the company to reduce its participation in the broadcasting rival ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Appeals of Competition that it will have to reduce its share of ITV by 17.9% below 7.5 percent.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB’s interests hampered competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that the acquisition of ITV shareholding by BSkyB raised doubts about the independence of ITV, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin’s boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator objected to the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly why, BSkyB said, would have delivered its voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the action of the administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Severe allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from office by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for low performance.
But later it was learned that the lawyers had not been assessed worse than their other colleagues, and many observers concluded that the dismissals would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
and may be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successor head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the dismissals, resigned from his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General's report is very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the case, and stresses how he had a "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, which he "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "notably non-collaborative" in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epic Meat Loaf of Child Honor
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said getting this recognition will be "an honor".
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group are taking the nominations for this year’s awards and ranking the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal ability like that used by Meat Loaf.
A two-minute instrumental section opens the hymn.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf’s Bat Out Of Hell remained in the rankings for about nine years and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of the First Street – before I found the Second Street – between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This street, more or less 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty street more than an active path.
There's no sign.
It is virtually impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
who wants to renovate Extra Place and create a clean hallway to shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-fashioned neighbors who commented to be enchanted by the truncated track simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block’s past before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Venture Community Committee for Land Use that took place this month, representatives of the agency Avalon outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, asked for a new plan to be presented next month, as said Susan Stetzer, Community District Manager No.3.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Ms.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install a few seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting for the spaces to be rented.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came up for the first time during this month’s meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it.
"The primary concern of Avalon Bay is the renovation of this abandoned alleyway and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a city’s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The CBGB’s rear door, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, is located in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that comes out on Ramones’ cover of the album “Rocket to Russia”.
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers writing about East Village’s burgeoning, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest they may be, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare, practically unchanged piece, a city rake that should be guarded.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk about the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little narrow and no exiting street, also dark by day and marked by doors of oxidized iron warehouse and counter-ventiles, with weeks-old newspapers blown along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now hosts a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz beer bottle were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested that it could be cleaned.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, humid, and scary places."
The debate on bilingualism: an immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “Afro-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very certain consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “bilingual transitional education” for English-students.
However, the question open to Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers teaching in other languages than English in the classroom, is effective in annihilating the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income families:
More than a third of the students, many of whom have just arrived, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively evaluated in the 2008 mathematics exam
and almost equally astonishing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using an ingredient other than that favored by Mr. Obama.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
In addition, and here is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the main Sixth Street, the school’s approach to teaching English to students is in the “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of language in the processing of instructional content.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like this last one who came from Mexico and that if you entered the classroom 12 months later you wouldn't be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating by other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubts about the answer, but the idea of its party politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their own constant support for bilingual education is the prediction of Mr. Obama’s response.
While it is true that immigrants must learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
And instead, he said, "you have to make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil prices drop sharply after renewed economic fears
Oil prices dropped drastically on Monday due to concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
Crude oil stocks dropped by 7 percent to <0x24>99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than <0x24>20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis in Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of <0x24>145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost <0x24>90 per barrel earlier this month, before retreating again due to huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety seized investors once again on Monday, despite Congress leaders saying they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was obscured by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy banking operations from Wachovia Corporation, according to the government on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, over the frenzy of the weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue deal "seem to have not been able to reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate will be increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is assessing whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
The bank’s analysts have lowered its expectations for next year, as oil consumption drops due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast of lowering oil and gas prices is 20 percent by 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
After spending, for the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw how things unfold in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without notes into a game of unwinding.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with perez under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles scored a 12 yard goal and suggesting the perfect preseason for an afternoon, when the evolution of the player relationship took a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the quarter, one of which when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds in the half.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, no matter what people may think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing in the dam, Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted an ongoing shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss Warner.
In the last turnover, the shortcomings forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets regained the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a final 34-0.
These are the biggest points the Jets have ever made in a room.
The team coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, “The second quarter or the third quarter?”
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second quarter much more than the treasure.
They’ve won a lot of points in a very short period of time.”
Gebrselassie rested to top his world record
Once again, Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie has demonstrated why many consider him the greatest runner in history, breaking his own world record in the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person capable of racing the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
After the win in the accommodating flat race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has broken for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in an impressive length race so it has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the counterclockwise race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not participate in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing – perhaps in a way too alarming, in retrospect – that air pollution would aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he was aimed at running in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing on average about 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distance runners-up, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory last Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered cramps in the pantorrilla two weeks earlier and that he had lost a week of training.
It is obvious that the suspension left you cool, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well.”
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s Afro-Eastern rival – for the style of orchestrating too much his races, in general, avoiding the encounter with many world marathon stars, based on the markers as if it were a race track, and setting the record for competing.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the four Kenyans' march, Gebrselassie reached the half of the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after their markers declined.
But just before three miles from the goal, Gebrselassie took a final push to break away from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi reached third place at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe from Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also did not participate in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her staff best record in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made a smart computing race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to do head-to-head and then retrieving them after 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop from Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, the pride and the tests of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, is a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully inhabited black city incorporated into Zora Neale Hurston's childhood place, is no longer as simple as she described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not a prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous Harlem Renaissance writer.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage by including it in Florida’s travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression Season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted to share their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what's going on."
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to starting a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"You have to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of black affirmation and a community of nearly 2,400 people living below a level of poverty twice the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a well-reported example of the rural culture of the Black South—sometimes despised, others praised—that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for the image of Eatonville really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through downtown Florida often forgotten inside the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a face of cement in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Outside the road to the left," he wrote, "there is the modern maroon public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of the widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitional rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts Eatonville in relation to the autonomous government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor did not.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston immortalized citing men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without notice in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts of dressing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcasticly.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," continues Mr. Franklin.
But, she adds, balancing herself in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer on stamping.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only colored woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no large commemorative ceremonies, no large public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her legacy were understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turnaround came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to set up a five-lane road across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street of the working community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to him relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mix brought hatred closer to the community.
“During that season, a group of white boys were going around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people sitting next door,” Franklin said.
"They also killed a girl, once.
They threw him against a car sandwich.”
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston, he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forcible integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "insulted instead of honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the desegregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the trust of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - they used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors, and artists who went above prejudices, just as she did, with whispering, confidence, and lines like: “How can anyone deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in libraries, reintroducing it in American cannons.
The road project came just at the moment when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was again under the reflectors.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The revived idea of the five-way road would have been to put what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd simply said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the city itself.
People out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (named Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, over a paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an abnormality in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, you may sometimes feel like a street of the past under a summer rain, in a town as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its significance, are often still treated with caution.
A permission in advance is required to do most interviews, and some things – such as the murals at the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field – cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a weakness for the bright red, still fear that her island community may be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival has expanded, a higher level of Christmas pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw her entire race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, working, stupid and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in Mr. Franklin’s 18-year-old nephew Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, in case they dare to go here, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,’” says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it’s a very nice city.”
Here in New York, everyone talks about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosks and giant television screens on Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the bee nest offices that lie above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York face the worst "bad day of the office" every day since the 1929 bay.
Boys for home delivery continue to make their metal carts resonate for tea through the staircases and carry muffins trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to drag between loaded apartment buildings, just like human mules, with 50 eccentric stamping shirts hanging across their shoulders. Office workers are still waiting in line for their meals to take away, and it is still impossible to work between 7am and 4am.
Employees are still waiting to make a queue for their bagel to sellers’ carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on days of the week.
It seemed to me that there was no crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a tail of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where customers throughout their lives order their checkbooks, tourists look for directions to go to Macy’s large warehouses and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "personal trust banker," and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places from which they had been switched, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn their money from the so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction company), the credit unions and the savings boxes of their hometown whose whites only work within the state of belonging, and who say they treat clients as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have silently failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with <0x24>327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed to their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with a savings deposit of <0x24>440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers in the offices and shops that stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were transferring their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that failed, and its troubled-looking executive director, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter familiarly as if they were complaining about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-one-something-uniform concierge of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the tender.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is done, I’m not taking any risk.”
Muslim tombs profaned as Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right party for Austrian freedom, and Filip Dewinter from Belgium, who is affiliated with the far-right party Vlaams Belang, are taking part in a demonstration to present to the "Cities Against Islamization" organization in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signals representing the mosques with a red line that crosses.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for defiling a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country’s general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but investigators think this may have occurred in an attempt to conceal the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in some way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which reached Muslim religious people when the month of Ramadan was coming to an end.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for an introspection round after the right turn in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that garnered nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Liberty Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogan was considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headcloths and burkas, and also expressed opposition to foods considered Islam-related.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European Brotherhood” to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties attempt to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses conducted immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the country’s strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Prohibition of travel abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from travelling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a ban on Glitter six months after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a ban on travel abroad last Thursday after judges produced evidence of Glitter’s earlier convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A Judiciary Service spokesman said: “On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Magistrates’ Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s travel abroad as well as to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as he was under the sex offender registry.
He must inform the authorities in case you wish to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to notify the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss the individual case or possible location of Glitter's stop in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “The Kent Police will do everything in their power to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “The Kent Police will do everything in their power to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to monitor someone staying in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protection of the residents of Kent is the main concern of the Kent police and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sexual offenders in the county and minimize any risk that may exist for the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he would return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Court of Justice of Uxbridge, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior reported that Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and delighted to hear that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I took the master out of the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
We don't have skirts or steering wheels or first-class suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed look of the man or woman.
On the other hand, the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, in those moments outside the public, when they find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a hand, careless because they are not going to go out on stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stages with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the Flamenco Photography Month program, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, increasing every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be anyone but, by looking at the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists in the stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of conveying in the scene passion, sadness, joy... captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists there is no need to take pictures from the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of Flamenco."
With the flavor of the "Sing of the Mines" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a record camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, remember classical photography.
The application of different stylish media breaks with the classical base of the image, conferring it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the action of the dance, the singing or the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the duende that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of nearly seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with “Portraits of veteran athletes” (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love portraiting people, meeting them and being able to get into their lives for a moment, whether long or short.
In photography, portraits are the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, that sometimes you don’t even know, or that leave you just a few minutes to be able to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Galleria El Fotómata, located at number 20 of calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel she writes is "a fear"
It is set in places he still does not know and verses on unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to pushing forward the new project in which he works, a novel starring Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and passed through the Amazon.
The ever-favorite Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage to the Hay Festival Segovia that the project he occupies today is "a fearlessness" and that "everything indicates he shouldn't write" the novel.
“If it made sense, I wouldn’t, but I’m going to do it and I hope to finish it someday,” he concluded in his speech at the exchange festival of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he’s seen passing through the city of the Aqueduct to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the highlights of the third edition of the party of the word and fulfilled the prognosis.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend", filled the aphor of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before himself a dedicated audience to whom he was made very brief the time in which the Peruvian, with a wonderful memory and with great doses of humor, recounted how his literary vocation was born in him, and what he derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of his "pleasure to read"; and what he writes about "to live more than what he likes."
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more inconform with their responsibility" and "does not write them off," so he pleaded.
Climatology undermines the Pozoblanco fair that is also left without regions
The festival of regions that closed the Pozoblanco fair’s fertility was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the advertised fertilizers that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Meteorological inclemence has eased with this fair, as finally two of its three celebrations have not been able to be celebrated.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
The cartel was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a closure of Castilblanco.
So, only on Friday there was a party.
In him, the triumphant was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante jumped his two assholes with a greeting and an ear, which gave more to the tenses than his toreo.
That is, even worse was El Julio, who passed through the body of Los Llanos without pity or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief blow, he won the bronze of a large part of the audience.
Control jumps in <0xC3><0x81>lava in truck with 2,000 kilograms of hashish
Five less ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armin<0xC3><0xB2>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Agents give up the two occupants of a van and they embark on the escape.
His cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not like stopping.
Officers chased and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to a statement from the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The detainee has been charged with drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control on the N-1, at their passage through the municipality of Armin<0xC3><0xB2>n.
They were willing to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated abruptly and the control was skipped.
Agents began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a few kilometers later in the arc, when its two occupants crawled to run for the race through a wooded area.
The hertzians finally reached out to one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish loads, so they proceeded to their transfer to police stations for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials verified that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the van documentation, so the detainee has also been charged with a public document counterfeiting offence.
The Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as it has been said, and determine the origin of the drug seized.
The detainee, A.A.J., 28, was transferred to police stations to carry out the corresponding diligence and will be made available to the court in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effects of some medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her car park in Montecito, according to People magazine a spokesman for the California road patrol.
The witness has detailed that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot forward and backward, and walking back and forth passed over his sunglasses several times."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently initially did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because “I was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
“She looked disoriented,” so the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center to test her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess of alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "according to officers at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drug".
Locklear was arrested as suspected of driving under the effects of some substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison around 7 p.m. although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its powers in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the training that will have to make a decision on the case of the former Councillor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being charged with family favors.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers," Callazares said of the performance that the party will have to adopt with which he has so far advised at the Seville Consistory.
However, the leader of IU argued that the need for "transparency" was present in possible investigations into irregularities that Silva might have committed: "IU has always defended that this type of matters have the maximum degree of transparency."
In the same line he stressed that the training has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'Sangre de May', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish uprising against the French in Sangre de May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros in budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the stream of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría leading a broad cast of performers.
Blood of May, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, will premiere on Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid lasting more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci assures that he has fulfilled this film "a dream of childhood", which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid three years ago commissioned him to film a commemorative tape for the second centenary of the 2nd of May Epidios, when he was based on the Nationalodo.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" of setting up with the decorated and the appropriate dressing room the portrait of "a spacious Spain that was mistaken as a leader to fight for, since the struggle for independence has brought the people with great delay.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had funding such as Alatriste’s or The Ghosts of Goya – more than twice that of May’s Blood – so he has not been able to film some scenes in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated for almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of "Return to Start" has influenced his usual form of work, the setting up with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the filming and with whom he does not cast, because he seems "humilde" and considers that "part of the job of the director is to go to the theater and know what the film is about."
Many of the interpreters with whom Sangre de Mayo coincide repeat before his chamber, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate for the Oscars on four occasions - of which he won one -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of Billiards and the finally selected, The Blind Sunflowers, must not represent a young generation who knows the Spanish cinema, "he has said.
With this film Garci does not expect awards.
“In the beginning you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize that you’re only working for prosperity, and now you’re happy to make another movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillen dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillen dancer too.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and when she was three she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dance.
He had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corse that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, which marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and it seemed amazing to me.”
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell her life but to gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested me flamenco sticks.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dance is also within this aesthetic,” she says.
The assembly features two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one of her shows, as he did in "The Open Door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with who was her pupil.
"Matilde makes Tórtola the greatest, the character of maturity.
I am happy that he has agreed to act in my work and I feel very honoured for it.”
The assembly also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the violin of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who always says the role of the eternal and accompanying artist in this type of love.
The work also somehow counts the life of this woman who developed in such remote places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to throughout Europe, as she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to remind her because I think it’s those women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now nobody knows and much less value her work,” Bayón says.
The show will start today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" also closes the Triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez contracted marriage with Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the House of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: El Camino de la Luz" which was inaugurated during the last month of May.
Also, the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America is less liked without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "The Absence of Maliciousness," and gives the idea of the homelessness of American cinema, and of all America, before the shocking idea that Newman has gone.
It cost them to give him an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, it was a mess for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better thanks to their existence.”
No one was afraid of ridiculing or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, fearful of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem for the soil, desperately seeking grounds for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue the men and very few beings to admire are left to you, there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and true.
He was Richard Nixon’s formal enemy and advocate of lost and won causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his overdose-dead firstborn to his home and organic food brand.
All a gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration barricaded Hollywood without addressing nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not a man but an era has died.
Another Englishman, the award-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing more or less than the summit of his career.
The bad boy who arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“We’ve all got a very high footprint,” said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who nowadays dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the demand for probity and having a serious and remote private life.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he was faithful when he was sure he had no chance to be.
“But why am I going to eat hamburger outside of home, if I have filet inside?” he used to joke.
In heaven, he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as the devoted husband, loving father, solitary grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is to have an Olympics in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
The perfect race was called, and in my opinion it has been the worst race with a lot I’ve ever been in.
A plethora of absurdities that, of course, if they took it as an assessment and I examined it, would be a very clear suspension.
But let’s go part-time and from the beginning.
The unintentional starts with the collecting of the dorsal, which makes you have to go before.
Which doesn’t look bad to me, but if they already make you go give it all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they just made you go to pick up the dorsal (first unintentional, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only 'S' size for the t-shirt (second unintentional, because I need a size XL)
In what world do we live?
Or is it because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a minute compared to those of race day.
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue upon arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes of waiting, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race began and we hadn’t left the backpack yet, although once achieved, the pickup was worse.
In addition, the rain relieved the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was combined with counts of popular rebellion and assault on the casket.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, won’t even show up with the right time in the ranking, because of the chip they gave me that, I guess, didn’t mark me out correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, it wouldn’t come into my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft Search Receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft has shown a breakthrough in a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft), a conversational launcher to move around the campus.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this “receptionist” can know how many people there are in the room, who they are—even remember what they wear—and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group the presents according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he’s there to visit someone and tells him he’ll be there for you soon.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked a lot about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of commercial bass loads, they would go five times faster — man, Steve, it will be for less.
All a finding taking into account that Microsoft, version by version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of direction is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and also the software.
When Google Chrome went online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many have pointed out correctly that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to be understood.
Do the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but we must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer has said this week is a confirmation of this idea.
People increasingly pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What do half of the apps that come with the system do for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
I took the photo of this post in one of Microsoft’s employee restrooms in Redmond earlier this month.
In the refrigerator machine a poster asks you to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather pulling to 2010.
Microsoft will probably be looking for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, will pass bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick’s ‘Blood Diamond’, the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola’s ‘The Father’ and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start listing stellar apparitions, we can go back to the image of that punchy bigot forced to lift weights in a walking circus.
Essentially, it's nothing more than the typical men's interior shirt in cotton, zipped and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the English-speaking people call, but the Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels stands out over all the others.
First, because of its ringing name – although familiarly known as ‘Marcel’ – it has to do with the sport because it gets its name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above all for its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive shield and the small (only recognizable) Belgian flag that the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as detail in the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine t-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for underwear comfort.
It is a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't care about me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz Sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than a handsome and famous girl who lends her name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the company Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
Warm and timid, wins in short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but at the same time exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from there we get a lot of references.
Then, I like to get lost in a city and watch women go dressed, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have a lot in common.
I liked clothes when I was little; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to hurl in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dress.
You know that dancers love to do our styling for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the dressing room, it’s when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
Have you had a crisis in your 30s?
What's going on?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I’ve done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because the body asks for it and I also want to be a young mother; I don’t want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my child a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you're on the verge of several premieres you shot last year.
That’s how it is, and I’m already looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who I am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, can't be.
I'm looking forward to the release of 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what they look like...
A few days ago, you debuted on a crossroads with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not that I'm going to go up a modeling lane.
I just called Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we exhibited - I took two pieces out of our collection for Mango - was auctioned to raise money for this NGO.
People don't know Naomi's tender heart.
There are so many things said about her that I, who knows her, would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm staying with that part so good that she's involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if I get to ask him to make the pine, so do I.
To benefit the women of the third world, whatever it takes.
Alcohol-related drivers will need to install ‘alcohollock’
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholism to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the drunk vehicle from starting, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual memory of the Attorney General’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver, so the driver will also receive a road re-education course.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor General’s Office, the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving again pick up the car.
The alcohollock would avoid it as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in breathed air and prevents the car from booting if the driver does not blow abs; or when an alcohol concentration is detected is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 and would run at the expense of the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce violations by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure clashes with administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing those behaviors before they derive from criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform by criminal means requires reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been experimentally deployed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative of the PSOE in which it is proposed to install on school buses this system, as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5.40 p.m., the plane of the Spanish Air Force on which the Princes of Asturias were travelling was landing at the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was retreating but his rays still forced him to use his hand as a visera to see the royal couple descend from the plane.
Walking stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier, he had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, well, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or something...
- No, no, no, she's Spanish, but she lived here a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 navy soldiers who interpret the salvation of honor.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the Princess, melancholy to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps he had been informed that in the DF was threatening a storm.
They give a smile and a school stop to the photographers before going to the room where the official committee awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the city’s four big ones, a reporter from Mexican television awaits them.
The best gifted prize of fashion
Perhaps there is no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, that Paris and possibly there is no more exquisite and bont living living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of The Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to boost the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is equipped with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, the Belgian winner of the first edition, Sandrina Fasoli, stared at her designs on Mango’s showcase at number 54 of Paris’s Haussmann boulevard and almost cried out of excitement.
By the way, it is the second largest store in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one is in London.
Many events, coupled with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who chaired the jury of the competition, made us end up at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the proximity to the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart broken of grief and making heart trips, for the recent death of his brother, put on a suit from the House and some ELAH fittings, which cut off the breath, and from his son Luis' arm - a cannon nearly two meters long - accompanied Valentino in his presidency.
Andik, owner and master of Mango, made the honours and was so gentleman that he finished, beside the baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had borrowed them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner she was transformed in a sexy long black dress, she was excited when on the night walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet rehearsal room and she 'love' one of them, remembering them to fold, to other times.
Inés Sastre did not stay on the walk through the palace dependencies, but before he taught us on the mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the sight with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another cannon that travels by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously ordered that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frenzy of everyday life.
And by the way, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to libraries on September 30.
The awakening almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to imagine yourself entangled in the tumultuous rhythm that current life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer is back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and disconnection problems with the world of work.
No, the number ascends to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together on the pages of a book a whole menu of possibilities tailored to each’s taste and minutes.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 Ways to Relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores by the editorials Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone feels that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this ‘manual’ rejects such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind and focus on reading.
Speaking of Sleeping
Some kids talk at night.
I’m not talking about those who wake up very spaciously telling us something that happened the day before, but about children who talk when they’re asleep.
The first time it happens best you get a scare, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign sleep disorder called somniloches.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told that he talked overnight.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis, or sleepwalking, but it doesn’t have to be that way.
As we mentioned above they may also be associated with very high fever pictures, stress or overexcitation situations.
However, it is an unstudied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a calm tone of voice, loose words, a whisper or the opposite (creams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any question that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him out this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g., if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid TV shows or series that are frightening or a bit violent.
With very nervous children and who have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter sleep.
Once the dreamloches appear try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's sleeping and therefore he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes it would be advisable to consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common), don’t fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You won’t get anything, because when you’re asleep, you’re not conscious enough to organize your thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming of saying that, with which you are very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory in his field after a long period of shortage.
Without having played a good game, the team created many goals and was able to score a goal to win the game.
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to crush the squad with a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and Fonderflick turn from a distance, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to stop Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we did not let the midfielder pass and left only Riahi in attack position.
The start of the second time was crucial, first with two goals from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousiens with the goal from Marais, well located to pick up the ball rejected in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the goalkeeper Illhousiens will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the opportunity and it will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who went back a little bit to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after an important butterfly, the ball passed very close to the crossfield.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a rodeo for Britain.
Faced with the protest of resistance on the part of fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided last Tuesday morning to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and hoped that he would " come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " Crisis Committee " created by Breton fishermen to take action against rising oil prices, which marks a record high at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.14 per litre.
According to Eliseo spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to be competitive again and to save conditions of employment and remuneration for sailors."
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic in Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors already showed on Monday their determination to burn, scratching the dawn, tyres and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, Vandea, where the cattle remained in the port, or Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges in the afternoon.
The fishermen in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday’s meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " Crisis Committee " will have to think Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " fishermen did not abandon " and " do not want to move to Paris " , for example, announced Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay petroleum taxes, currently pay about 50 cents per liter but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached only with an oil price of less than 0.30 euros per liter.
The Magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two Men and a Destiny " has died of a cancer, at the age of 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautical company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh in the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 deliveries, Embraer President Fredrico Fleury Curado said.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 appliances to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which has been out of trouble thanks to the U.S. monetary authorities, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to reimburse its <0x24>85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG’s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to consider possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Financial Times added.
No final decision has been made on these sales, according to the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to reimburse its <0x24>85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing U.S. authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the proper proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to save banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, a loss never seen on the nearly 800-point stock exchange, and the Nasdaq 9.14 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial index fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most significant drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded last September 17, 2001, the day on which exchanges resumed after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq index, the technology dominant, dropped 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the Standard & Poor's 500 widened index to 8.81 percent (i.e., 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis early in the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed a bit of market stability to recover.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the media he requested.
About two out of three Republicans rejected their plan.
"That's not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
“This shows how far the market had this plan,” added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come “too late.”
“If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the leverage (the American central bank, the Network’s N.) to manage the crisis, which would tighten the credit conditions further,” Brian Bethune, head of Economy and Finance at Global Insight, warned.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, " every day that passes is announced the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities organized the acquisition of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, causing emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing “not only a crisis in the U.S. but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen dramatically.
The return on the 10-year Treasury Bond fell 3.632 percent, against 3.827 percent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year Bond 4.161 percent, against 3.357 percent on the eve.
Obama, winner of first television duel
At the first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House, another came to know who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen considers that John McCain’s performance, though honorable, was not “brilliant enough” to allow him to slow down in polls to five weeks after the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama five points of advantage (49% vs. 44% for McCain), says it’s the Democrat who went well.
Among the indecisive voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out victorious with 39 percent of respondents, while 25 percent of them concede victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the good expected performance of his own candidate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts,” Clinton said this weekend.
Septuagint McCain highlighted his undisputed foreign policy experience, emphasizing his opponent’s “naïveness” on these issues that were at the heart of this first bargain.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused on several occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president,” he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama said he represented the future.
Not to be confused, he proved concise and precise.
He enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so,” he replied, this weekend, a Democratic television advertisement blaming the Republican for not considering the importance of the crisis’s impact on Americans.
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a recent rain.
He didn't pronounce the words "middle-class" or "workers." "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most capable character to save the economy that is on the brink of the precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive episode," he estimated, yesterday, influential and Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to Bill Clinton’s during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the final consequence of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that it would in spite of all the tax cuts of 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street outbursts, the Illinois senator also noted that achieving a possible energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a health and safety system.
McCain plans to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates avoided issues related to the <0x24>700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday afternoon on the main square of the Belarusian capital to early reject the results of the parliamentary elections.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closure of polling stations in Minsk’s central square to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to protest against President Alexander Loukachenko's power: "The dictator, he has to resign " .
Some admit not having voted: "For what, as they will do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has put foreign observers right in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
Sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
It was not according to the opposition.
"We have been placed alongside the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of the votes," said Iouri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous twelve-party regroupment.
"It is a cosmetic change," stressed Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, is the executive power.
If some members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
“But its entry into parliament can mean television appearances, regional meetings, and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debt against Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that participation figures appear too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) favored manipulations.
" Have you noticed the elections? Question Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five MPs of the opposition to parliament, the ones that are better suited to power.”
The silence of the night returns to the square in October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec was celebrating its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to be delighted, because Hema-Québec has been once again one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence that had been seriously hesitated by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which aimed to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster could not be repeated.
While Judge Krever was delayed in presenting his relationship, certain provinces then set up a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this mission.
As a result of the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Society with blood to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, almost 38 percent of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, recalls Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence,” he says before proudly affirming that in early 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we witnessed in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of the mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, that when we do not know it and when a serious disease can emanate from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, we put in place measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had stayed in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proven undoubtedly that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that allow donors to detect the presence of the virus directly in the blood and not anti-virus antibodies, in which the tests used so far were based.
Nucleic acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We could reduce this period by less than a week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk that certain donors will be infected without knowing and that we will not be able to detect them.
These improvements significantly lowered the risk of contracting AIDS by a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“That means there will be 12 million blood products to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission occurs for a blood product.
I think it is now possible to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without worries,” said the head of Hema-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, for example, the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant,” says Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Hema-Québec should also provide sufficient supply.
"Necessities are increasing because the population is aging.
Since anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences on the blood donor network that, on average, regroups only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation.
All people with good health, 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria can nevertheless donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Poverty is very rare.
But members of this donor network need to be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain it and encourage it to be a regular donor.
Since current life is very unbroken, we rarely find time to spend an hour donating her blood,” Francine Décary says.
With a budget of <0x24>297 million annually, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, putting on the bank our thousandth sample of blood from the umbilical cord and is expected to take out more than a thousand of these each year.
We should start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year,” says Dr. Décary describing this cord blood sample program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed that they can't enjoy this " as Hema-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Softbol - The Impact in the Semi-Finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-finals of the first USL division's elimination series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in finals) victory over the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive quarter-finals match, at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal anywhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who smashed Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the round-trip series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The impact will be measured on the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the game back to take it by 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed in the semi-finals by 5-4.
The impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – Kovalev’s Victorious Goal
The Canadian’s number one trio is ready to start the season.
The team composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostisyn encouraged the attack in a 3–2 win by the Canadian to free throw barrier against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostisyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev won by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I avoided the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play as much as possible in the first time, noted Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation.”
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out running elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get elected during today’s partial election.
To reject the limits of our last great northern border ": that is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while staying on the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
In three huge screens, they paraded spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, from Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large media as during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the elections will take place this fall, although he made it clear that his schedule was very full.
The “Northern Plan” is the fourth side of a “vision” that the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a “new economic space,” which includes an agreement on labor with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern 49th parallel territory - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explain why the North was " a jewel to immense potential " but gave no end, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could be most developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond " , according to Mr. Charest ' s list.
This " territory twice as large as France" is our home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it’s in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was applying for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built much thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during a press conference.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I reiterate that position on the part of the government," he said.
"With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the passage of the northwest, which will open each year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the Quebec Ungava party), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role to play began some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting at which " a common vision will be given " .
The development of the North would be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly " , he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“As the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring weekend themes, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s coming to power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes rebaptizing the Beauharnois Central in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
“De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made the James Bay our party knew how to forge the future,” said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Regarding the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"This stays between us, but I expect to be there," he confided to his militants, sparking applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that no elections would take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He stresses that his schedule is yet full, particularly due to a federation council mission in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council on the weekend supplied the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems to accept: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular calls for recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
It also wishes that Quebec appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they have the right to veto decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcome the great lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If I had done so, "we would have made progress today," Mrs Marois commented alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (voting that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The Quebec Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastian Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on holiday today.
lyrics - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) at Harper's office, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonour this woman who has led an unceasing struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration what she says all about the relations of Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It’s a government that doesn’t take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that he was accused of happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, refuses its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who encounters a false justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it doesn’t matter if a young adult is psychologically destroyed, undoubtedly forever after so many years of execution.
We still don’t realize that, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” that’s the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when no morality exists anymore: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far wants a minority (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has given up what our country’s reputation and dignity did.
Mr. Toews, the shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice President and Director of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
According to Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world’s largest gold company attempted a six-million-euro defamation trial against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a “transparent public debate”.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to hold a public debate would be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to theirs?
The outcome of the dispute is of little importance, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers held by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly arrangement that will amortize the opposition as well as scare anyone who dares to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by change of mind and not by whistleblowers.
It was therefore sufficient for the miners to open their books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent search teams that could have clarified the matter.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could ask for a "public" debate, disregarding the opinions of the latter?
According to the Vice-President, this word seems to refer only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What he doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the audience that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so above all because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not within what many people perceive as a persecution-murder (seeing the "public debate," Barrick Gold has just filed a claim with respect to the authors of Noir Canada that they do not use this word more intimately).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and the truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and debate facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the wealthy businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under many persecutions, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s unscrupulous persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he does not want to have a transparent debate.
It’s a loss for the university world, but also for public debate in Canada, and it’s time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the <0x24>700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by the chosen to implement it, new mechanisms aimed at ensuring the reimbursement of the public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of houses embarked on the failure to pay, as well as a right to verify the wages paid to the leaders of the assisted enterprises.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We are making great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done to cover the economy and the ordinary Americans in the face of the current Wall Street crisis,” she explained.
“It’s the fundamental point: if we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances about Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would lead to a new failure in investors’ mood.
The last hour that had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the U.S. presidential election, who have joined the negotiations late, were rather in favour of the deal, but they did not forget to express their dissatisfaction with being forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the deal, particularly that would allow owners to retain their home and that on the salary of the leaders of the surviving companies by the state.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he said on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interviewed in another chain to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I have read [show] that it is something we will have to digest and with which we can advance.
He said the option of not doing anything is unacceptable.”
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers money the dubious debts, risky and inexpensive assets of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the explosion of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgage credits before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and causing a freezing of liquidity and a disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have come out of the stalemate since the Democrats accepted that certain “toxic” assets of companies in difficulty are only secured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of eradicating the atrocity for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to take on losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would aim to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which another 100 billion could be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote from Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will pay him dividends in the event of a profit and that will be able to re-sell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the embargo proceedings concerning housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as set limits on remuneration and on cash compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it subject to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, it is not yet certain that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest against the project yesterday, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House’s Finance Commission, told voters that “with all the evidence, Washington doesn’t want to understand.”
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the one that consists in taking advantage of the taxpayers.”
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to say to us: we ask Congress not to hurry and carefully examine the path that must be taken,” he said.
At this very moment, in Europe, we once again had the test of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (<0x24>16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was renouncing to buy its bankrupt competitor since it lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion (<0x24>2.9 billion) during the U.S. risk real estate loans crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, on the other side of the Mancha, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that is suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all pending loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>41 billion (<0x24>75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Committed Icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Did the American actor with a charming smile get rid of his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His smell, sensitivity, and a talent that was obvious will have also removed him from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fast years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, whom he looked a lot like and who was long regarded as a rival in cinema, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the breakup of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born.
No measurable ego, last quality mark.
Because he projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the wounded fighter of the Pacific War, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then frequented the New York City Actor's Studio, before triumphing in theater, television and soon in cinema.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, though a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also disappear the secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the show world that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death sparked the filmmakers’ vertigo this weekend, as his big roles shattered the black screen of the memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual change parades through it.
Many memories return to memory as the cow-boy with the charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone through the history of cinema.
This Rocky Graziano, criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable boxer in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This lovely manga in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 among nine nominations.
That face that changed over the years, it was him.
He's still alive.
The seasons change during his career.
The young people know it mainly thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, a coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a last role as the Irish mafia's father in Sam Mendes's Road to Perdition in 2003, the rice was ripped up.
Unlike several film legends who soon left the race, Newman stayed a lot in the film world, denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its fasts, and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge that lives in " underplaying " and that judges his performances too supportive.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of a young gallon than of a marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose traits reflected rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed sides his true pudic sensitivity not very well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott due to overdose dedicated him to his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work of smell and sadness.
Among the many tributes that were sparked yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (who had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, deeply saddened: "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, he also hides a great civil rights activist, ecology, independent film, a protester against the excesses of Hollywood.
We’ve seen a lot of your face reign over the bottles of vinegar sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, though it started as a gag.
The profits from these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than being content with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And it is a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What were they producing in the invoice factory Zuschlag & amp; Co. ?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant damage, in business, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the funds obtained in public tenders were used for their own purposes, justifying on many occasions the fulfilment of tasks with fake invoices.
The public funds and those of the town halls - in total about HUF 65 million - stood in part in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and in part in the pocket of private individuals.
The method, which was announced by the researchers as well, was to justify the collection of funds obtained from public tenders with fake invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the various associations never met their assumed obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were fake.
For this, the talonaries were obtained in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided, among others, on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and these served as a model for making the invoices he presented, among others, in the contests of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as in the City Hall of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, wrote the reports necessary to obtain the public grants.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and its accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However – according to the center manager – so many people don’t fit at once in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jök<0xC5><0x91>ór Foundation – later called Together for the Third Millennium – was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however on the bill there were one hundred and thirty people.
But the fancy invoice manufacturers also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in its book holding - according to information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jöj<0xC3><0xA5>árt and Hoppá.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s manager, told hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor’s office and showed him the invoices, he knew it was fake documents.
“In the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place.”
He added: in addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the bill a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people fit.
In addition, the invoice also included meals, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
Enthusiasts of invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organises travel abroad, so that in the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which also did not coincide with the agency’s invoice issuance practice.
In addition, as it was known during the investigation, VAT was included in the document as well, despite the fact that travel outside the European Union was exempt from tax.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfälöp Kft. for the Jobb Jöt<0xC5><0x91><0xC3><0xBD><0xC3><0xA6>r Foundation, since the services of the company are not charged with a 25 but only 15 percent VAT, in addition, the staff of the hotel only extended invoices made to the machine however was the manual invoice.
In addition, the "dispatchers" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company in which they placed on the invoice as an activity carried out road transport to which - learned during the prosecution's investigations - the company founded as an investment consultant does not perform.
Equally for formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was learned that the invoices issued for Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, for XXI. Századi Cultural Association and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehretó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, therefore the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - refused to issue such a document.
The bills consciously expired.
Another group of fake invoices manufacturers is made up of those who were aware that they should issue fictional invoices.
The Esély Budapest Foundation Foundation, on the request of Young Baloldal - Youjú Szocialistak, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Foundation Together for the Third Millennium.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the charge - convinced one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictional invoices.
In the same way, he collaborated with Zuschlag and his comrades Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jöj<0xC3><0xA5><0xC3><0xA5>rt Alapítvány Foundation, the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület real activity.
There was no capital movement either, since then they canceled the prepared invoices but forgot to mention this entity in their documents.
The following group of fake invoices manufacturers include those who have some connection with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with its fictional headquarters in Budapest, who was dealing with the trade in fuel and vehicles.
The company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the data from the investigation these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov was also supposed to have dispatched documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Egjutt to the Third E.T. Alapítvány charging the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faispari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian Albanians at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked due – according to the defendant – to the fact that they did not get a job.
But he took advantage of these companies, as at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor’s Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri comandita society to issue fictional invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generation and Association presented a competition for Modern Hungary in January 2006 by the Táncsics Mihály Foundation (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They got HUF 500,000 from the contest, respectively, but did not use the money for the purposes of the contest.
To prevent this from being discovered, five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft were presented to the TMA.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei had at the Ministry of Education headquarters.
Some of the defendants will likely report in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of counterfeiting the bills.
The most interesting may be the confession of the chief accused János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions have so far not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so far.
The question is: what interest does it have to do with it?, for perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists came to an agreement with him for Zusi to assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested home arrest, but he was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, who have never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for the verdict, he has no possibility for that.
Psychology of Overlaps: Why We Spend More Money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
New York University neurologists and economists have discovered the neurological-economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in Science magazine, people don’t want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists attempted to establish the neurological scheme of this “game” through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lottery, the other participated in an auction and while it was examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging system (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games participants could earn money, but during auctions, where it is essential to bet more than the other, as the loss of the game intensified the operation of the complex called stratum located below the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the “self-reward” mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention not to provoke an intense stratum reaction.
To base their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups wagered against one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive <0x24>15 more prize.
Instead, the third group received exactly <0x24>15 before the auction, but in the event of losing the auction the members of the group even lost that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one, triumph was highlighted and for the other, failure.
However, checking the neurologists’ hypothesis, the members of the group that played “against failure” were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the “winning” group.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
For so far, they explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped solve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to go to the doctor?
Around 500 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the patients do not know they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the common name for various diseases of the liver caused by viruses.
Symptoms are very similar; they are characteristic of liver infection and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humors (sperm, vaginal humor, saliva).
Travelers are advised to protect themselves with a vaccine against viruses A and B, against C, there are no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, it manifests itself by means of a general malady, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that appear on the skin and in the white of the eyes the jaundice, the excretion becomes clear, dark-colored urine and healing can last up to two - three weeks.
Every year, one million people worldwide die from liver cancer and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they are ill because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Therefore, premature recognition, systematic medical control, is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and those who wear tattoos.
Today there are about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory checkup as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptom.
The disease has healing if it is discovered in time, it is possible to eradicate the virus from the body, so it can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its goal is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
Does it hurt less to those who believe in God?
According to a recent research, religious faith has a calming effect that also relieved the deaths of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious belief influences human pain, reports the British newspaper Telegraph.
As part of this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of research in which besides academics also participate scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University.
The analysis took place as follows; they fixed a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the patient, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at it in two paintings: the Virgin Mary, a 17th-century work of Sassoferrato and the 15th-century Lady of the armor of Leonardo da Vinci.
The researchers hoped that the show of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a soothing effect.
Patients spent half an hour on an MRI scan, receiving 20 electrical shocks in four consecutive parts during observation of religious theme painting or the other.
The Catholics stated that when looking at the Virgin Mary they felt in “security” as people “protected,” “they calmed themselves and peace reigned in their hearts.”
By observing the religious theme picture they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so striking you can get a similar effect with atheists as well, you just have to find the right image.
“We should find the portrait of a person they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
“The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality,” Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On its tenth birthday, Google can say: it can be found in people’s pockets, as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, what doctors they visit, and what they’re interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is not enough yet.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwellian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original goals of Google’s founders: “We gather all the information of the world in one system!”
According to Google’s leader, the company, even after ten years of work that turned the world around, is still in the early stages of the effort to be able to process all the information.
To the question what is going to happen in five years, Schmidt replied as follows: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like “What to do tomorrow?” or “What would be the best job I would do?” – however, software will not be able to answer questions that seemingly simple as there is not enough user information.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their web browsing, the searched keywords, IP addresses, and the pages they went through at the end of the search are accurately stored.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, can re-review what they looked for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic will be based on the Recommendations, in which the system will offer us previously defined products and services.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? – ask those users who are concerned about seeing Google’s information monopoly.
In most cases, the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already a confirmed fact that they not only retain, but in justified cases also hand over to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed to the Brazilian government the information from its website, called Orkut, to identify the pedophiles.
On the other hand, Internet users concerned about human rights were relieved in May when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully proved in court that it was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the verdict, you will not be obliged to ask Google, by any means, for any information from the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to achieve its pretext of strengthening the Child Protection Act passed years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and a thousand search phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
That’s how Google’s opinion is quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who fear to provide their personal data because they think their privacy, their privacy, is undermined when they start using Google’s services, and they rebel against it as well as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, internet users and users from other countries see in them the future generation, the “avant-garde corporation”, not its rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as the conqueror of the World, so much as both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google unlike Microsoft, does not ask users any ID code, nor money for its applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and looks younger, more collaborative than the official software giant’s practice.
But it may also be because geeks accurately see the very problematic relationship between people’s rights and the Internet that came about precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young person can have profiles on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then these can be included in a tracking system such as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, you can also have them in the recica or the recick of the F.
We can know numerous cases from which it turns out that, for example, the bride, when looking at the next morning photo stream of common friends, finds out who spent the previous night her fraudulent boyfriend or can completely fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the life of the company: he is a definite thing.
A person's "on-line" life is what she shows herself - this is the definition that hides behind the behavior of youth of our day.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to avoid the Google monopoly, can do so (starting with, for example, the Scroogle that uses the Google search engine, but leaves no traces).
There are many people who don’t want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from being found, but Google’s “online” apps can be replaced, from text-writing software to image-reading apps with alternative versions that don’t connect to giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile on us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day that Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of <0x24>156 billion is worth more than IBM (<0x24>140 billion), Intel (<0x24>124 billion) or Coca-Cola (<0x24>110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenues of other companies, but Microsoft advertising agencies, while the services that are introduced do not quickly cause serious numbers to worsen.
Critical observers, however, will find the alarming contradictions as well: for example, the top management rotundaly rejected the protest of employees after doubling the company’s childcare price, they considered too expensive to agree all the unlimited number of violators of employees, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that the year in which the information was published.
One of the company’s internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is already ready to work, which if it is certain that the predictable problems of the coming months and years will come back to the world: while some may believe that the company’s comprehensive scanning project and archive of books and magazines will be yours, Google will acquire them for the first time.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, will be able to provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, the popular novel by Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwellian form that future, in which only a man from Google’s data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the footprints of the perpetrator of the city of <0xC3><0x93>zd.
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd who, according to a substantiated suspicion, helped erase the traces of the crime - said a spokesman for the Public Order Commissioner General in Borsod province on Tuesday.
The girls recognized the crime that was charged with them, and they are currently being accused of being the perpetrators of the crime.
The two minors - according to the Hungarian News Agency - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd - a 23-year-old man - has been in preventive detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he cited his creditor at the headquarters of a company in <0xC3><0x93>zd, where he killed him and then killed the 9-year-old daughter of the victim.
According to MTI information, the young man prepared himself much earlier to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime scene.
The police analyze with an expert the gun and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech crowns – for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which within a few months wishes to sell 60% of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far they offered the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that among those interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that with it, in the future the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts calculate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent stake, followed by Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the deepening international financial crisis speak of a “second September 11th”.
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - the Republic of Rome opinions - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill made hastily, whose aim is to give a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new “Pearl Habor” that billionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it’s better to talk about a “Second September 11th.”
According to a portion of the Madrid press, Washington is the expiatory bucket.
In the view of El Mundo, the mistake of the U.S. political leadership was the one that led the world economy to the brink of an abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing and this will then have an impact on the entire world.
Although Bush’s plan wasn’t perfect, after the congressional vote, the danger arises that Washington doesn’t offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – precisely when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
This threat cannot be overlooked - points out the Geneva Days-Anzeiger.
Some states today may still be able to put a life-saving belt on tampering financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
But if the dominoes break down even more banks, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis only received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion on Monday, according to Der Standard, adding that concerns are becoming more and more real that, as Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
So far, the EU has not taken seriously the crisis that is going on as a cue for the Old Continent.
The "savers" will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid greater evil?
The smart car mimics the flight of the beehive
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of existing obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, the beekeepers.
In a surprising project presented at the CEATEC of Japan, beekeepers gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic steering system of nature-like BR23C cars, which were given the characteristics of beehives, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During the flight, each beehive creates its own private oval space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained at the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, RP Technology Director and Development and Research.
Composite eyes of bees play an important role that are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of compound eyes, the engineers used the laser-length measurement system.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at a 180 degree angle, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor that immediately turns into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot imitating the movements of the beehives, changes the direction by rotating the wheels to the extent necessary.
Unlike any current system, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If not, the vehicle robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process should be carried out in one open and close eyes.
However, unlike bees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be bidimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the beekeepers to avoid other beekeepers, here they only used as a possibility for the auto robot the rotary movement and the acceleration in addition to the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and their energy density is higher, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the ability to process data, not much less that of storage.
This apparatus in every second should only process some input signals and react according to the case.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so only uses a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
No gigabyte or megabyte memory is required.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately bypass the obstacles, which according to Nissan’s calculations, can be incorporated into mass-produced models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, bypassing the existing obstacles on his way.
He already has a name for this dear child.
The written version of the law of the <0x24>700 billion financial bailout package has been prepared, which will be applied in several phases in order to buy bad credit from banks.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to the East Coast schedule during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, Congress leaders reached an agreement around the <0x24>700 billion financial bailout package in total, after several days of discussion, Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the US Congress, stating that there is only a need to formalize the agreement in a document.
The commitment on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the commitment, said: this program will work and be efficient, but more measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but turning it back to the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 p.m. on Monday, according to Central Europe time), without causing a spectacular leap in the stock exchanges.
On the bill called emergency law for economic stabilization of 2008, the U.S. Congress will vote first on Monday and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the deal.
“We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all <0x24>700 billion to buy low-quality credit fund securities.
Only half of the <0x24>700 billion can now be spent, using <0x24>250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, on this sum, the Ministry of Finance will buy credit, under-rated securities and the fate of another <0x24>100 billion depends on the president’s decision.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the <0x24>700 billion could be spent after a new Congress decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it will be able to simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and credit fund securities, in addition to other "poisonous" credits as well.
The purchase can be made at auction or in direct form - the competent people of the ministry reported.
The law allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated that the law thus secures the necessary financial means, which can even reach <0x24>700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, dealing with the purchase of bad financial means, its insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the collapse of some major financial institutions.
“We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it,” he added.
Instead, the heads of banks who are in trouble and awaiting state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American argot simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of assistance of the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys as part of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed for the gold parachutes, unless the bank’s failed boss retires.
By buying bad credits directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that bosses’ compensation is not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations relate only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the program as well.
This is the first case in U.S. history that will be in effect a legal limitation on the revenues of CEOs, said Barney Frank, the chairman of the congressional commission responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the participating banks in the programme, thus reducing the risk of the taxpayers, as they will ultimately be able to even make profits with the transaction as soon as the economy and the bank recover.
According to the bill in the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to repay taxpayers losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their reservations about the project.
This is not what American citizens have entrusted us, that is, taxpayer dollars are not being protected," California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said.
Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur said the measures prompted the same people who were responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial Prices Continue to Rise

In the rest of the processing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water representing a significant weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was recorded in August, primarily as a result of the effect of the official price increase from July 1.
In a 12-month comparison - in the domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - the largest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 per cent).
In the metal manufacturing sector, an increase of 13.2 per cent was observed, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, of decisive weight, there was an increase of 11 per cent.

Will you no longer need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities for around January 12 to enter into force the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, in front of the Hungarians residing there.
In his opinion, “practically everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system across the Atlantic.”
At the same time he warned that in the new system the entry premise will disappear, but tourists must register before their departure from the country of origin.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy holds talks in Washington.
He will interview Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing her the Median Cross with the Order of Merit Star of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with international policy advisers to the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks’ financial bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates for the two major U.S. parties on Sunday assured their support for the administration’s <0x24>700 million banking aid program, while there are politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-type negotiations, announced on Sunday morning that a principle agreement was reached on the banks’ financial bailout package.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and freezing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rivals to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, by prioritizing economic issues, Obama again gained some advantage and disappeared from McCain’s advantage after the Republicans’ convention with Sarah Palin’s candidacy for vice presidency.
At a Detroit campaign rally held last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the <0x24>700 billion package law.
He pointed out that the proposal includes those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
“We have to act now and responsibly (...) is at risk the employment, the savings of you, as well as entire industries and the stability of the whole economy,” he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to classify McCain’s economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain, he explained that “we will all swallow this with bitter sorrows (...) but not doing anything is simply not a viable path.”
The Republican senator said the proposal included the establishment of a control committee to the Minister of Fineness and the limitation of executive compensations, he insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain played no major role in the consultations, instead he consulted with the minister daily.
Congress president Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that Congressmen will likely vote on the bill on Monday.
German-speaking press magazine
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious voters — says Der Spiegel on the weak CSU election result in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red-and-white coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavaria Revolution devours its parents" analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had assumed office.
Social-Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria – and now it is these modern citizens who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that was already predicted for nearly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU got 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. even during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consistent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the same time they have made a lot of mistakes, but the secularization, the results of education and the settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria have had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
With modernization, opportunities are also increased, and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, but within the group itself the voters became more conscious, more critical, and more stubborn.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it has been precisely the conventional groups of citizens who have moved away from the CSU; the autonomous, the small industrialists, the graduates and the graduates.
Thus, less than 40 percent of support for the CSU was withdrawn.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper: "Who with whom?" In his article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved on issues of coalition" - deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open in all directions to negotiate, while the Greens do not yet wish to consult on the coalition.
The elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party leaders barely let them see some of their bargains.
Werner Faymann, the president of SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question as to whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, in the post of vice chancellor.
He claimed that they had at least disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
It is still open in the party whether they will choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed within the <0xC3><0x96>VP itself.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government,” Haider said.
Jároka: Breaking the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also the European Union’s vice-president.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that hit gypsy children and is also the biggest obstacle to their attention.
This high-level conference was inaugurated - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights organisations.
Jároka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Gypsies remain out of the labour market in the first place due to their low level of schooling.
“Most young Gypsies have not completed secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small part can get a university degree.”
Jároka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of gypsy children at an early age can strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise a broad awareness of these issues both among Gypsies and among non-Gypsies.
For the earlier a Gypsy student starts school, the more likely they will be to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
“Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education,” said Lívia Jároka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate the processes of school deprivation, for which proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of fundamental importance.
“We have to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we have to offer Roma children the possibility of ensuring a democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens with full rights,” Jároka said.
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, held annually since last year's Berlin meeting, which was held on the occasion of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is aimed at ensuring a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October a decision will be made on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the severe electoral defeat, no headlines have yet been cut at the summits of the Bavarian CSU, so far the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, the party’s president, and Günther Beckstein, the provincial prime minister, are still in office, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent election loss, will be decided at the party’s extraordinary congress to be held last weekend in October.
The members of the so-critical duo left the interview: they did not hold so much of their positions.
With this, they intended to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago – although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career – the social-Christian union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the stamped blow against Stoiber, they achieved just 43.4 percent.
For 46 years, the CSU had a “monopoly” in Bavaria that accounts for 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the province of the South, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to prevail, in the future they will undoubtedly have to coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, the federal minister of agriculture, one of Huber’s potential successors, also holds a position in the reduced intelligence group that initiates negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors on a possible governmental coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about the fate is that on the list of Free Electors enters parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was harnessed for the coup of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly erased from the stage to the ambitious local politics.
The top CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber will also receive an active role that has so far been moving the ropes in the background, the former provincial head of government and former president of the CSU called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and for Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be Chancellor if they are not able to highlight together the CSU that played a transcendental role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could conceal her disappointment over the failure, the CSU’s losses will not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
This, of course, is relative: it will not be easier to deal with the injured CSU and the social-democratic crisis continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday’s elections, there will be no opposition MPs in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Alexander Lukashenko guarantees in the country, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is rather explained by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
While the 10-million-populated legislature of the country, comprised of 10 percent and 10 deputies, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time in parliament would renew his mandate after the 2006 election, would be "modified by the time of doubt".
So the ODSZ suppressed the boycott it originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a loan to moderate the import of natural gas increasingly expensive from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to have a political level, and to improve its relations with the European Union, which is not anti-male.
It was a sign of distension when the OSCE, when assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive phenomena rather than errors – such as the ban on participation imposed on one-third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE primary report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself – in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press – and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
With all this in the view of the opposition feels an improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners were released and Minsk is willing to face a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which two regions already consider Belarus as a federal state.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime fears allowing even one opponent to enter that parliament without weight".
The opposition does not plan to organize protests by seeing the results, but rather seeks to bring to the voters their message about the need to make economic reforms.
"This clearly causes us many problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities are putting difficulties in their distribution, but even so I see that more and more are those who support the change among the elderly too," said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that they do not believe that the sub-regime of Lukashenko is the main result of social security.
Due to the country’s debt and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security that “seems to the silence of cemeteries” – said Milinkevich.
Russian observers, unlike opposition politicians, described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People don't believe in words but in facts", so that the lack of opposition is nothing but the testimony of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on you have breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
but from today it starts with this measure against whom it fiddles and then you go to the bar to have a coffee at work hours.
This news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument for better work, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," the minister said.
“Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is opening up.
This is Reformism,” Brunetta once again stressed.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation in all buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There has been no resistance on the part of the employees, the Secretary-General assures: “It has been a change shared by the workers and there has been collaboration on the part of the workers.”
In short, no more breakfast at work hours; no more coffee and mid-moon.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchin at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences due to illnesses of public employees have been reduced by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people at work in a year."
And he adds that it is necessary to make public administration more effective
“The salary dynamics in the last 8-10 years have been doubled with respect to the private sector and well above the inflation rate,” the minister said.
For now, millions of public employees have joined forces to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the lowest absenteeism at work due to illnesses – the consumer association writes – the people of the ‘vague workers’ are constantly increasing.
There are actually millions in Italy of correct and productive public administration employees who have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate norms of the decree.”
In particular, the Tar contested the exclusion of aggregate economic treatments due to illness due to service; the extension of the time zones in which medical check-ups of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Work Accidents, Napolitano: "Crucial Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents are verified at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalidated.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the leading causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the Victims of Work Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The worrying data circulated by the Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is,” said President Giorgio Napolitano in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, the National Association for Mutilated and Work-Valided, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative effort in favour of prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and awareness raising of public opinion".
“There has been a ‘stop’, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their dimensions, spark the scream of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the daily reality proposes us dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is taken from the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness-raising of the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to slow down the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative rules.
The President of the House, Gianfranco Fini, has stressed "that the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes a decisive effort on all institutions to urgently end".
“The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive step, but this does not remove the number of white deaths equally impressive,” said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
“We do not want this ‘decreasing tendency’ to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that explodes the tragedy.
“We believe that at a general level it is still too little to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, at our discretion - he has stressed Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world."
"There is a further effort - he added - in terms of communication and awareness raising of public opinion.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration in the level of subsidiary protection for labour victims" and the "assistent derivation towards which the system is heading in recent years".
“The goal is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker, because the luck of the accident does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator each time.”
Mp3 readers on charges, risk hearing
Listening to high-volume music for a long period of time using portable music devices like Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injury.
This is the case with the European Commission, which cited the opinion of the European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (Csrseri), published today in a statement published in Brussels.
“From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical instruments weekly for more than an hour a day having the high-volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity.”
“I’m concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high-pitched acoustic cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irreparable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific evidence – the EU’s responsibility follows – a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is to raise consumer awareness and deliver this information to the public domain.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and keep up with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this originates.
"Scientists confirm that this is a cause of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable and affine musical devices."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concern increases as the hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and noise exposure time.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that if users of portable musical instruments listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limit for maximum noise consented at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent hearing loss after a period of 5 years.
This means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which has been established this morning at its new headquarters behind the Termas de Caracalla.
Within six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will deliberate on the main points for Rome.
Once closed in March, the board and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official ball" of the Municipality and its intendent Gianni Alemanno.
“The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to stress Alemanno – It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which political decision-makers, the board and the municipal council, will then be able to vote.
There is no more role position, just the willingness to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March the work will be completed, because this experience must have a precise timeframe.
In June we will present the strategic plan using the Commission’s work for the future of the capital of Rome.”
To whom the Commission is accused of being useless, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno answers: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that turn and turn manifest.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
“This Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to make participation and reason the best minds expressed by the capital.”
For Alemanno, in effect, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, from which we have absolute need, thinking in a unified spirit to its future."
A future that, according to Rome’s intendent, “will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries but will look beyond” not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but “also considering the role that Rome can and must develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean”.
The first anti-American president.
A prominent American politician has written: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and had relationships (as he also does today with a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks against Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambitions.
“Obama has a big face of stone: he thinks he’ll win the highest position of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!”
Actually, they’re attacks that don’t say much; they’re clearly racial attacks and they don’t answer voters’ question: Will he be a good president? And besides, there’s the polls; everyone says Obama wins and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there is someone who speaks to the heart but not to the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the southern intestines of the United States, has written an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we will know well who the American patriot will vote for.
A side of the American mentality covered up to the last.
“Say whatever you want, we’ll think about where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we’ll leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: What were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent it home with kicks in the back.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make the suitcases.
Similarly, Iraq for most has been Bush’s weakness.
Whoever will take the place of George W will have a huge duty to develop.
In the United States, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in the newspapers it is time to cut. Many blame the Internet, "assassin" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been interviewed by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Today, however, most journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated to be less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not to be reduced substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that national journalism is following the wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many seen as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn of has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing the technology in the hope that they “do something good” for journalism.
The biggest breakthrough today in American journalism is between those who run the newspapers—i.e. the directors—and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are confident that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage is down to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work security.”
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of “take it or leave it.”
Directors almost always get good wages, while editors can earn up to <0x24>10,000 a month, plus retirement and social insurance.
For the holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, are "sick" followed throughout the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROME TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA SHOULD BE IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the case of real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the field of the investigation into the anti-pacte on the escalation of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the arrest process in charge of her last week, she obtained the home release, transforming it into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
Their lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the <0x24>700 million bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this one, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times yesterday gives us a confirmation informing us that the current crisis is disarming the Republican party, increasingly divided between its old soul on the East Coast, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead conservative, hostile to "the ones of Washington" and the world of the South, over the finances.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotent with the vote of whom he spoke at the beginning.
This is barely quoted is just an example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here alone.
In both the United States and Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to act as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double category of state sovereignty in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking institutions – would finance which have, if, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all are much more compromised the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: i.e. how to respond to the difficulties and the protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or has little to say: the crucial test is the European Union which, as always, divides between different interests and different state strategies, does not succeed in deciding any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone is expected to intervene, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all funding subsidies: from the moment the court is reached, only the state has the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values under certain circumstances in which no market and no organization will likely ever be able to dispose of to the same extent.
This new emphasis placed by the crisis on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance as long as the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a factor very linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of the intangible, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to account for more and more intangible things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, look at yourself, can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth but are equally united at all in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself a sovereign, certainly possesses many more letters to those who are not, and to those who have the misfortune of living in a place without crops, oil and water.
I came to the second novelty that but presaged a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take over the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, of an inadequately raised economic nature with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the Western countries in an increasing number.
It seems to be advancing more and more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the so-called social elites, the same way of feeling and of being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, to have made its own time and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a nutshell, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimation of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which are manifested in an electoral "revolution" or in the sudden changes (with the backlash of the social moods of these recent times, with the backlash of the Socialist, from the conservative exit of the Austrians).
It has the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say some, make it ever more difficult to understand and then to represent, what is now taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis potentially re-creates.
Faced with all this, speaking of a “mass rebellion” today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue for walking over the walls
Overcoming the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walking over the walls like spider man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has approached quite a bit.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to have glued a body of 100 kilograms over a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of those who use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, coated with microscopic hair that can ensure the animal a perfect adherence.
Tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon, and lining paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "takes off easily from the walls," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers for walking around the walls exactly like the spider man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat and electrical current conductors.
Other applications may have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
OTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair that self-clean dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to apple juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken concomitantly with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing as appropriate, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices be packed that fresh associated with taking some medicines David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in progress to Philadelphia sends a new alarm: it is enough to take a glass of fruit juice, and the patient's apple juice, and the patient's apple effect, and naranja.
Pomegranate juice was already under charge because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs.
The same Italian drug agency had given the news in an information bulletin two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to what is drunk in case you are taking a drug such as Met or Diasep.
NOT ONLY POMELO – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by apple and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: "These findings are generally pointed to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the informational notes of the same.
Therefore, it is necessary to always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us impress, ask clearly to the doctor or pharmacist.”
The Novel of Economics by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, business models, and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s decisions regarding the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attack, in those days that broke Enron, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years came reproached to the economy, but which has now turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and a little annoyed by how the memory of Enron’s and Worldcom’s collapse scandal has quickly vanished from the public’s attention,” Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank’s executive committee, Krugman is a “great-value economist,” but also a divulger with a “very aggressive, particularly critical style against the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration.”
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year's work by volunteer developers, of whom their backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: to the welcome screen and to the less coarsely reviewed interface, others are added more consistent 1. such as support for the OS X format, and support for the Apple OS Do.
Also focused on multi-function with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it by email, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphical processing module, while preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet can intervene in various users, avoiding conflicts of modifications, in the preparation of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent to home or work.
And if the theme of the free can be a hook for the spread in the houses, it is in business that Open Office the suite test, try the big bet, already able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And not even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened up.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint presentation; Dbase, as in the case of the known Access is the program that allows to work on the database; and finally Draw the graph module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that up to now we have reached almost 3 million 600 billion, with the release of the new version is likely to exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the Tour de France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, third-classer and winner of the best climber swing.
The news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive runner in the third-generation Epo, after Italians Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also Gerolsteiner.
Kohl’s blood samples are among those conducted in the last few weeks in the Labs in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the evidence confirms that it is positive, the Austrian will lose third place to the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm Kohl’s positive doping news at the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has declared to the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, awarding himself the swing of the best climber.
INMIGRANTES: NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION, ITALY IS RACISTICAL?
Italy as an immigrant country has only recently become a privileged destination for the hostilities of immigrants.
This is what the New York Times is asking in a long article that has devoted to the debate on the topic of racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso murdered in Milan the previous month for stealing a box of cookies.
This case proves what the New York Times defines as the "North paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are recorded, but also the country's highest anti-immigrant sentiment and the highest support of the North League."
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited intolerance episodes in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation that the League wants to tighten the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A trend marked by the Pope and the President of the Republic: “Giorgio Napolitano finding Benedict XVI in Congress has called for the state and the church to work together to combat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rental, up to 900 euros per room
The university rent market is not aware of the crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the union of tenants, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the high costs that the family would have to bear – explains Laura Mariani, responsible for the study office of Sunia – in these cities the strong demand has completely distorted the market to such an extent that residents have triggered a general process.”
Apart from the fact that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, without a canon limit, sub-leases linked.
Extraordinary interventions are necessary for Sunia that, through the revision of the taxation, can be regulated prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Band Nere zone) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 euros for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University(San Lorenzo, Plaza Bolonia) you are asked about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It saves only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and surrounding area.
In Naples for a bed you serve 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed they serve you 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one individual.
In the smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the city’s economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of renting students and extra-Community students is more common, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% in the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to old cinema Paradise, cities cancel historic halls
Historic cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the large Italian urban centers and also in the province cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticulous in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of monkey rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
Almost always disappearing are historical places, full of memory,"it's like a friend dies, a friend with whom a piece of place and so much excitement was shared," observes the director of the new movie Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago always won the Oscar-winning cousin and the grand prize of the jury in Cannes.
The figures given by Anec, the main trader’s association, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and to pay the most are mainly the halls of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures are Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas less, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the event of the multiplex is responsible for its disappearance, it is these three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new meticulous cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec,” it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to move to the meticulous.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the state’s previous debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector it would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to be concerned about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono sala both in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the rules envisaged, there are mediums of tax facilitation in favour of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special parking fees.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” observes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is true that to contrast the extra power of the meticulous, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a subject that was always important to me: the closure of Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to perform the "New Paradise cinema", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the already closed Via Nazionale Quirinale, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.
Link between politics and 'drangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniformize the municipal elections for those interested in the Piromalli skull."
The charges are heavy that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the Intendant and Vice Inspector of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the Inspector of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by Mafia Association.
He was also arrested by Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his granddaughter lawyer, the same name as the boss, already convicted of mafia criminal association and to indemnify <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
“Despising any legal and moral norms, and in a good sense,” the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay consultations to attorney Piromalli.
“The mafia family would have been allowed – write the judges – to officially enter within the municipality facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "arrangements between bad organized life are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'drangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean.'
The detainees of this morning are added to those of last July after police had announced the head-cutting of the Piromalli family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been lifted from the charge of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the UDC's lieutenant at the time of the dissolution, after the May 2006 ballot, had been elected as head of a centre-right coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call into question the deputy interior minister who was Marco Minniti at the time, accusing him of organizing everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, "the availability emerges to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniformizing the elections of the public administration over the interests of the mafia families."
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage.
It is an extinct site that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the major global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources over which the big ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of accumulating energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, along with the first oil crisis, research has been intensifying.
When the price of oil was low, in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was removed, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil are driving the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This amount would be twice that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be the currents and tides.
Giants to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 sealed an agreement to build an implant in the north of Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are ever more and among these companies who have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying technology on ocean energy,” said a spokesman for a U.S. oil giant Ha-associated to the economic Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a pretty important signal, given that the U.S. continues to extract oil in Alaska and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicates an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubts that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as those of the Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy on a large scale, a technology with greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good connections between them.
The force of the waves, which moves the good ones up and down, turns into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
Pressure rotates a turbine that in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four such implants in development, awaiting only federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and for a parking lot, using submarine turbines on the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there is tides, makes the pallets of the turbines rotate, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electricity, deserves at this time the potential of tides.
While this is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mainly about tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others approaching the coast, have invested <0x24>7 and a half in 2008 and an investment of 35 million is planned for 2009.
