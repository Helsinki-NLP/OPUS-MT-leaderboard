28-Year-Old Cook Found Dead in San Fransisco Grocery Store
This week, a 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a grocery store.
But Upura's brother says that he can't imagine anyone who would like to do something about his brother, indicating that "his life has finally begun to improve."
The spot, which was found on Wednesday at the Westfield Store, was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galicia, said a spokesman for the San Francisco Court Medical Expertise Office.
The San Francisco Police said that her death was recognized as a murder and an investigation is underway.
Upura's brother Luis Galicia told the ABC KGO that Franks had previously worked as a chef in Boston, but six months ago he got to his dream job at the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" in San Francisco.
The representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" informs that the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
"We are a small team that works as a united family and we will miss him very much," said the representative.
In this difficult time we think we are together with Frank’s friends and family.
Luis Galicia says that Franks had initially stayed in hostels, but his life has finally improved lately.
"He came into the new apartment and met a girl," Luis told the KGO radio station.
Luis Galicia claims that he does not know who would like to marry his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always pampered his family by cooking delicious meals and cooking lunches," said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in a fight.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"Given everything that went wrong in the world, he was like an unprocessed diamond that glowed every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about the incident is invited to call the SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
New doctors strike: calls for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors call on their union to start protests in the dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association (LMA) New Doctors Committee (JAK) is about to ask for advice to support wider protests in early September.
The JAK considers that the ministers have failed to raise doubts about the agreement.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected LMA’s proposed contract.
58% of all members who participated in the vote voted against the treaty.
In a tweet published on Thursday evening, Elaine McCorta, a member of the UK Council, said that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the offer of the contract has been rejected.
She said: "In view of this, as a result of the UK vote, the proposal for the contract has been completely rejected and a decision has been taken to request further formal discussions to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JAK formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the development of new agreements to enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the young doctors participated in six strikes, including for the first time in NHS history having stopped working.
After the vote rejecting the proposed terms of the contract recommended by BMA, the representative of the new doctors of the LMA, Dr. Johans Malawan, resigned.
Before meeting with 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer is good and will be accepted.
After the vote, health secretary Jeremy Hunts informed that the contract would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: An Alliance?
The gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to discuss and announce the end of the eight-month-long war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leaders at St. Petersburg Castle, it seemed that Ankara needed more of these partnerships.
However, they both did.
Vladimir Putin's smile looked crowded and did not cause warm emotions, even given his usual resilience.
On the other hand, the redhead Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has called Putin "a dear friend" at least five times.
I'm losing the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to the pre-crisis level, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm causes conflicting feelings.
However, Putin’s rage shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the intrusion of a Russian aircraft into the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted axially.
Putin accused Ankara of smashing a dumpster in Moscow’s back.
The overdose was even more painful given that it came from a friend.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, Russia’s public position has changed, though.
For months, government-controlled television has spread aggressive insults against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed that the Turks were guilty of everything.
The most serious allegations were that the Erdogan family itself had profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied it.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received President Erdogan’s apology.
Russia could see it as a sort of victory.
The benefit of Ankara from the peace agreement is evident.
First, Erdogan needs all his possible friends after the unsuccessful coup last month, in which he was tried to gasp.
Also, countless terrorist attacks have shocked his positions.
There are also economic motives.
The Russian sanctions have caused substantial losses, in particular the ban on charter travel, which usually ensures the influx of millions of Russian tourists in Turkish resorts each year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Also, Russian tour operators and charter companies facilitated boots when regular flights will be renewed.
They look forward to a holiday fever in the Mediterranean according to the season.
Already this week, state TV is predicting a fall in the prices of fruits and vegetables, as Turkish imports of fruits and vegetables will be restored.
As quoted by the local newspaper Vedemosti: "Christians to them, tomatoes to us."
However, the visit also had other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for, in their opinion, the weak reaction to the attempted coup.
All of this can also be seen as dissatisfaction with the prolonged accession negotiations on the EU-Putin intervention, which is willing to take advantage of the situation that Turkey has withdrawn from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly gained additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing support for its elected government after an attempted coup.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because the fears of regime change in the country are deeply rooted in itself.
The summit, which took place in this ghastly sea castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to unite forces, as one analyst called it, the two countries that feel disengaged from the West.
However, despite the unity that has been demonstrated publicly, there are still considerable differences between the two countries.
The main conflicts affect Syria, where Russia presents itself as a mediator of peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
After more than three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided the issues of disagreements between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus as to how the two countries could find a common language on the Syrian issue.
However, after months of hostile relations and potential disasters, when a NATO member Turkey smashed a Russian fighter jet, the situation has improved, as the two leaders have at least resumed talks.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The mark SKB will continue to play a supporting role, announced by the Executive Director of the Bank.
Outside Scotland SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans told the BBC in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank’s ambitions on a global scale.
It has given up on these ambitions, as eight years ago the bank was almost bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
In the meantime, brand management strategy experts have used SKB brands to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with Six Nations regbi and ending with Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it is now decided to place other national brands at the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the head office and the official stock exchange list, will be changed to the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now, smaller private financial brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will also have a focus.
Makevan was interviewed during the trip with clients and staff on Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland channel: "SKB will become our investor brand and with whom our employees work, because now we are becoming more than a brand bank."
Over time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue to sponsor "Six Nations" and will engage various brands in sports sponsorship.
“It’s time to become a branded bank, because we’ve long been asking ourselves the question of how to become a better bank for our customers,” says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
However, thanks to the hard work and focusing on the needs of our customers rather than our own, we have obviously made great changes.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
Frankie Detori wins 3000th with the first place in the New Market with the horse Predilection
Detori is suspended by the champagne, defeating his 3000th victory by finishing twice in the first race in Newmarket.
On Friday, Hockey Frankie Detori won his 3000th victory in British history, earning the first place in Newmarket.
He achieved it by battling a second victory in these races, which took place in his hometown, going with Predilection, coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to have achieved such a result in horse sprint races.
He has joined Seram Gordon Richard, Douga Smith, Lester Pigot, Pitt Eder and Willy Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Detori, who had previously won with the horse Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I'm very upset because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because I have lived here for 30 years.
This isn't a big race, this isn't the Royal Ascot, but it's a normal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After victory, Detori and Predilection are welcomed with applause and joy.
Two jockeys have reached this record in the race with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and the career-ending 20-time champion Sergeant Anthony McCoy, who set several records in his career, winning more than 4300 victories.
Lester Pigott, the nine-time derby winner, won 4493 wins during his career.
Frankie is one of the best jokes of today and it is no surprise that he has achieved success that he rarely can achieve.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactics make him feel different from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, his enthusiasm and charisma for years attracts fans of this sport.
A few weeks ago in the Epsom race, I told Frankie that he would have already won 6,000 wins if he hadn't been in the races of the week and the big races.
But seriously, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been regularly winning the UK races for 30 years now.
He is a life-threatening man who is very useful in British races, and he is an excellent jockey.
Franks Detori noted this achievement with his brand - flying downhill.
From wind speed finishing to flying downhill, Frankie Detori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been a full-fledged journey of adventure.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 "Great Seven" in Askot, and has survived the plane crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength of character, challenging those who questioned him by returning to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for another time - Detori has previously stated that he would gladly continue to take part in the race at least until the age of 50.
Russian President Putin Releases Sergei Ivanov, Head of Administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired the head of the administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been Putin’s closest man for many years.
Currently, a 63-year-old politician has been appointed Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement said that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the duties of the head of the Russian administration", without giving any reason.
Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012, was appointed in place of Ivanova.
The 44-year-old Vaino is a frightened diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
As reported by the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later led the President’s minutes and the administration of government employees.
After his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your work as the President of the country by drafting laws and controlling the execution of your decision.
On Friday, Putin told a Russian broadcaster that Ivanov himself wanted to leave his position and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Does a smile convince you?
This step has confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is a sense and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked in the Soviet security service VDK.
In this position he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At the hearing broadcast on state television, the two men announced that Ivanov was resigning from office on the same initiative.
But despite the camera-oriented smiles, such an explanation rarely convinces, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of the struggle for power?
No one knows that.
However, the official claim that the man, who was considered a possible president, all of a sudden wanted to become the leader of Russian environmental policy, is caught with great skepticism.
In comments published on the Kremlin website, Ivanov says to Putin: "It is the fact that in early 2012, I ask you to trust me in this difficult position, I could even say, a problematic position, four years.
It turns out that I have been in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously, he was Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former employee of the State Security Service of the DRC, just like Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, which is a successor to the VDK, Ivanov assumed his deputy post.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanovo among the five people he trusted most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanovsk was considered a potential candidate for the Russian presidential office, as the re-election of Putin to the third term would be unconstitutional.
But at that time, another close ally of Putin became president - Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the presidency.
The apparition of the mythical fish in a garden in Banff
A man from Banfas asks for help to figure out the conditions of what kind of fish appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Beins thinks that 75 fish could be sand dunes that have been removed with a waterfall.
Mr. Beina, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the fish on the Periscope website, hoping that someone would know how this 5-inch fish got into his garden.
Crossing of the Wine Sphere: the bridge is now connected to the Faifa.
Currently, projects worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion are planned to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the northern part of the Quinsfera crossing and the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Faifu.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The construction of the Faifa bridge is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
Currently, projects worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion are planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Browne had arrived at the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensbury Bridge."
In this project, we see an unbeatable engineering solution, where more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel are used in the construction of these parts alone.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the last stage connecting the bridge to Rosita will be installed today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for coating.
Michael Martins, Director of the Fourth Bridge Connection Project, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates high-end engineering construction.
After installing the last phase of the road and connecting it to the support of the northern tower, we had to connect the northern phase of the road to the part of the land, or viaduct.
This was done by delaying the portion of the viaduct of the northern promenade 700 millimetres to the south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
Giant, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and had to pull slopes of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was only a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Simona Bailsa gets gold in women's gymnastics.
He forgot his opponent.
Forget about anxiety.
Simon Bailsu is not worried about it.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortlessly perform gymnastics on the balcony.
Invincible on the floor.
Totally flawless.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American gymnast won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was higher than the score of silver medal winner and team-member Aliya Raisman and bronze medal winner Russian athlete Aliya Mustafin.
On Thursday, U.S. athlete Simona Bailsa exercised at the individual multi-fighting women's gymnastics final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bailsa became the fourth American in a row to win a multi-fighting championship and the fifth best gymnast, gradually reinforcing her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and possibly the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she ran out of tears, because the long road to this moment was over.
This achievement puts him next to invincible athletes such as Michael Felps, who raised his sport to a different level.
For the past three years, Bailsa has dominated in its sport form, earning 15 medals at the World Championships, including 10 gold medals, performing combinations of so excellent, precise and ambitious gymnastics that the 1984 Olympic Champion Jessy Whispered in the Wrestling World Championships by Marie Ludwig Reaton.
In Brazil, she was expected to take the final test, where she had to compete to a large extent with the expectations placed on her rather than with the other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas without a gold medal.
U.S. athletes Simona Bailsa (left) and Alia Raismane compete after winning the gold and silver medals respectively in the individual multi-fighting women's final at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics, Brazil, held on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bailsa on Tuesday, making special selection coordinator Marta Karolji the opening party.
While Bailsa claims that on her long journey to the summits of fame she had hoped for nothing, it is not true.
Part of her performance in free movements, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympics arena.
It's not an event.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still pregnant and discovered by coach Emiya B<0xC5><0xAB>rman’s mother on a trip to the gym where B<0xC5><0xAB>rman’s beards took place, has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She hasn’t lost in multi-fighting since the summer of 2013 and the series of victories can continue as long as Bailsa wants to.
While Mustafin stood out in the leadership during the two rotations, it was just an illusion.
Balance balcony and free movement - part of the race, where Bailsa will defend his championship title, is still just ahead.
She took the lead with a score of 15,433 on the balcony and strengthened leadership with a score of 15,933 in free movements.
Raismane gently whispered to her as she awaited the results, which were only formalities and she leaped into tears of joy when the dream she had ever recorded in her notebook came true.
The result of Raismane was a small revenge on four-year-old events when she shared third place with Mustafa, but lost the fight for the bronze medal.
This time, a 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "Grandma", stood out in convincing leadership.
After the performance in free movements, which raised doubts about her return, she was able to devote a kiss of air to the effort.
In the meantime, the 19-year-old Bailsa’s viral Twitter post r, which she published this week, has a completely different meaning.
6-year-old Mahays Brown, a "sacred species" survives a shooting in Philadelphia.
Police report that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, stating that he is already the second six-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The child's grandparents confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia news channel that it was Mahays Brown.
My grandparents say that Brown was shot several times, including in the thigh, leg, arm, and abdomen, but he was still on his own when he was taken to the hospital.
Her grandmother, Delores Melendez, told television: "Her little body was just a mess of logs."
I can't believe it.
The boy in critical condition has been placed in the hospital and has already undergone several operations.
The family informs that he will definitely recover.
He had to start going to first class at a local elementary school.
Braun is one of four people who have been intercepted in a part of the city of Germanaun.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one in 29-year-old men is in a critical condition, but the other two victims are stable.
The channel reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims did not find themselves in the car and the police investigated whether any of them were the attacker.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that a number of gunmen were likely involved in the shooting.
On the scene of the event, the gun cartridges belonging to various weapons were found.
It looks like it's been a long shot.
There are shovels on both sides of the pedestrian interior.
"As a result, there seemed to be a number of gunmen here who were actively involved in the shooting," said Philadelphia Police Captain Antony Ginaldi.
Injury also occurred to several homes and cars.
No one has been detained yet and it is reported that the police are checking surveillance camera records.
On Tuesday, during the shooting, a bullet struck a 6-year-old girl in her hand while she was playing in front of her house in the Westoukleen district.
She gradually recovers, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simon, Gaby, and Laurie?
I call it the annual Women's Olympic Lightweight Team for a number of reasons.
First, I have been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, this team has three lightweight girls, Simona Bailsa, Gaby Duglasa and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspired by many young girls.
People can be proud that this team also includes Alia Raisman, a Jew, and Medison Cocian, a Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the last four years, the best gymnast is an American of African descent.
Last year, Simona and Gabia took 1st and 2nd place.
They’re impressive results.
In the previous Olympics, Gabi Duglass became an Olympic champion in a surprising turn, and America was able to leap.
Now the world has seen the incredible exercises performed by the three-time world champion Simon Bailsa, Duglasa and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal in the women's individual multiplayer.
Her team-mate Alija Raisman won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can give, but the situation in the rest of the country during exercise hours is completely different.
Simon, Gaby and Laurie joined the Olympics as did Alicia and Madison.
She is the "Olympic Five" because the next Olympic gym team will have only four athletes, and this is the last year of coach Marta Carole at work.
Actually, gymnastics is an expensive sport. Gymnastics mainly train at private athletics clubs, and they are maintained by parents who pay for training, rooms, travel, fitness, hotels (trainers, athletes and their families) and for other reasons.
Most of these athletics clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes do all their workouts, and it is an expensive and long-lasting contribution to the families of lightweights.
Eimija B<0xC5><0xAB>rman - Simonas Bailes' coach and Megja Hainija - Laurias Hernandez's coaches have trained their athletes since the two girls started working on athletics.
We need to provide the young girls, who are inspired by Simon, Gaby and Laurie, with cheaper fitness training opportunities.
I founded my own athletic organization 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer gymnastics training for more than 15,000 young people in the city (mainly black and Spanish) free of charge or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my hometown) to provide local young people with the opportunity to learn about this great sport.
Athletics develops strength, placement and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and aiming.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team inspires thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it is amazing.
Dealing with this type of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simon, Alia, Gaby and Madison for the great demonstration of the "Girls' Force", winning Olympic gold medals and motivating countless young girls of different origins to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt’s offer was rejected, the new doctors plan to spread more strikes.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on amendments to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association, but this was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 new doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Hants announced plans to enter into a contract, indicating that the NHS is in an unstable state and further delays will only harm employees and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes in working conditions at night and on weekends to improve working conditions in non-standard working hours.
Yesterday BMA's representative of the new doctors, Dr. Ellen Macourt, said that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will deepen the labor crisis and that it does not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
There are eight weeks left until the first group of new doctors will sign the new contract, so progress must be made, because there is not much time left.
BMA's efforts to resolve the problem through negotiations have faced the government's reluctance to engage and, sometimes, complete silence.
This happened despite the fact that even last month Jeremy Hunts said that his doors are always open.
Jeremy Hantam should act immediately , stop inactivity and cooperate with new doctors .
If he does not, then the new doctors are ready for new protest actions.
During the last strike at the end of April, more than 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed, while nurses and consultants tried to replace the doctors who had taken the piceta.
The Ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on amendments to the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate per work weekend for 54,000 new doctors covered by the new contracts.
NHS Employment Executive Director Daniels Mortimer urged the new doctors not to strike.
Mr Mortimer explains that the strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on loaded workers and cause stress and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families.
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the new committee of doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have answered positively their questions about caregivers and rapporteurs.
Employers expect to actively cooperate in other important issues, such as the placement of employees, flexible training, in addition to training for those returning after a career break, the cost of training, training in the course of a training program - in the course of the course, the mutual recognition of the courses, the absence of the courses and the work of the course.
The drug by 2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had heart attack could be treated with the drug for about 2 pounds a day, as official representatives recommend to take it for more people and for a longer period of time.
Contraceptive medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrence of heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of recurrence of a heart attack.
NHS representative NICE recommends using this preparation for 4 years after heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, the current NHS advises NICE to use this preparation 4 years after heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessels.
Approximately 140,000 people experience heart attacks each year in England, and a quarter of them experience repeated heart attacks or strokes.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat in the walls of the heart, forming blockages.
If the constipation breaks, it can create a thrombus, blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
In contrast, if the thrombus separates from the wall of the blood vessels, it can get further into the bloodstream and block blood access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of recurrence of a heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombus.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years at 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
NICE Director of Health Technology Professor Carol Longson explains: "Despite the availability of medications for the prevention of recurrence of heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke that often has serious consequences."
Fears of repeated heart attacks can leave a negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence suggests that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurrence of heart attack and heart attack in people who have experienced it before.
Provisionally recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we can extend the treatment options to thousands of people who are thus beneficiaries.
Given the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that it be used longer than this deadline.
The culture of political correctness promotes fraud in Muslim communities during elections
According to the management report, the former mayor of Tauernhamlet, Lutfurs Rahmans, was dismissed in connection with corruption.
The government’s report reveals that as a result of the culture of politic correction, the eyes are focused on large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Ex-government minister Ser Erik Picles has criticized the police, election monitoring and city councils for ignoring the signs of fraud in the election process because they are "fearful of violating ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the head of an anti-corruption organization, says that voter harassment for religious reasons is so widespread that police should be allowed to deploy guards at polling stations to protect harassed voters.
He also suggests that voters should be presented with an identity document when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
Currently, voters need only the name and address.
He even recommends marking the fingers of the voters with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Reporters should also provide greater protection, says Ser Eriks.
He believes that the press should have greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He said: "The goal is not only to prevent fraud in elections, but also to protect the local municipality from the wider corruption and culture of fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by Dauningstrite after a scandal in connection with the elections in the city of Tauernhamlet.
Last year, a special election court ruled to remove city mayor Lutfur Rahman from the city because of corrupt and illegal activity.
The court found that Rahman had "circumcised" his Muslim community's religious views and scoffed at his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with the belief that the religious duty of believers Muslims is to vote for him."
Approximately 300 votes were fake or questionable because one person had voted multiple times.
Sergey Eriks also notes that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that fraud in the postal vote was particularly troubling, where the elder members of the Muslim community forced others to vote for their desired candidates.
Serge Eriks recommended a number of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document to clarify the identity of the person.
The report said: "Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for the elderly elected candidates of the community, especially in the communities of Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There is concern that the regional authorities will not pay attention to these problems because of the political correction, as it could affect ethnic and religious interests."
Serge Eriks outlined 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists to act with votes handed over by mail to prevent "collection of votes".
The report, which was reviewed by Teresa Maya, also called for a more thorough registration check to prevent the use of voter lists for fraud in the field of immigration and benefits.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to present their identity document before voting.
Mark the voters' fingers with a special ink to prevent duplicate voting.
To systematically verify the nationality of persons to ensure that the person has the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from voting by post and polling posters to vote by post.
Ensure that the police are empowered to deploy guards to electoral districts.
To make amendments to the law to make it easier for persons to be held liable for intimidation under the Human Rights Act of 1983.
Forbidden to photograph elections in constituencies.
Determine the requirements to use only English (except in Wales) in electoral districts.
Strengthen the training to ensure that the staff of the districts make sure that the voters go to the polls one by one.
Sergeant Erik sharply criticizes Metropolitan Police, expressing ambiguity that no charges have been filed in the Tauernhamlet case.
He said: "The election court only disqualified Luftru Rahman and his representative for acts related to corruption and fraud."
He was convincingly found guilty by the standard of criminal evidence, on the basis of infallible evidence.
He also criticizes the ineffective "call check" of the voters in the electoral registers of the city council.
Ser Eriks comments: "The court decision taken last year is an alarming call.
Our country is known as the homeland of Parliament, but the alarming and concealed spread of election fraud and institutional exposure to the fact that fraud does not endanger this good reputation.
Cycling - Keitas peers and other Rio Olympic Celebrities peers
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics will be thrilled with the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, whom fans have described as extremely similar to the Duchy of Cambridge.
However, the 24-year-old cyclist is not the only athlete to fight for gold this summer, which, according to the media, prides itself on his celebrity peers.
Therefore, in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently visible on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic Games participants that are almost identical to the Hollywood stars.

CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for commenting that the Chinese swimmer was 'ended like a pig'.
Bairon McDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yankee finish in fourth place in the 4x200 m freestyle squad for women, called the contraction of the storm CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize, as one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer from the race was "flying out of the race, forgetting himself" and "ending like a pig".
Commentator Bairon MacDonald thought that his microphone was turned off when 4x200 m free-style stickers for women presented their personal opinions in the final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC comment team to give the comments vividness, said: "This little fourteen-year-old from China can't bear it."
“She was too much in the air, she flew out of the race, she was forgotten alone, and ended up like a pig.”
Thank you very much!
The score of 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan in the second stage was 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds slower than the score of Canadian Tyler Rucka, allowing Canadians to reach China.
Viewers across Canada immediately reacted on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such a tone and expression.
Emets McFarlane tweeted: "A CBC commentator just said that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "ended like a pig"?????
The idiot did not understand that they were still in direct ethos.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m freestyle final for women was named as "the little fourteen-year-old girl from China who doesn't wear it."
Criticism of Bairon Macdonald quickly took effect, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter users couldn't believe it when they heard Bairon Macdonald's unpublished comments.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: "Oh, <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and because of you, we all sound like racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who at the time led the CBC live broadcast, apologized for Macdonald's comments, saying, "We're sorry that the comment on the result of the swim was reflected in the live ether."
It was an unsuccessful choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
Macdonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
CBC then collected apologies to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about Macdonald’s comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We are very sorry that such comments have been made and they have come to the forefront.
Yesterday we immediately reacted and apologized to all the viewers and social media followers of live streaming.
For the sake of clarity, it should be said that Bairon’s comments were made on the performance of the swimmer, not addressed to him personally.
But in any case, they were unprofessional and unsuccessfully chosen statements and Bairons very sorry for what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald personally apologized for the direct ethos and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
On the CBC Olympics live he said: "I would like to take the moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle races."
I’m talking about the performance of the swimmer, not about him personally.
To put it simply, I did not intend to show any mercy and I am really sorry that it happened.
Primark buyers are shocked by a woman who unkindly tolerates in the middle of the underwear store.
Buyers feel uncomfortable when a woman started dressing up to fit her pants in the middle of the store.
Even worsening the situation, she adjusted them to make sure that they were sticking to her and then pulled them off by dropping the pants back on the shelf of the store.
She continued to search for clothes at the Folkeston Bouverie Place shopping mall and wore four more pants.
Primark store Bouverie Place in the Folkeston Mall – the place where this woman wore underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At the time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children, was also in the store, telling her that an unknown woman, after adjusting to underwear, pulled out her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She points out that people were unable to trust their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took her underpants from the shelf, pulled out her socks and pants and then measured them on the spot.
She didn’t even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just kept them on the spot.
Everyone watched her pull her pants and apparently the woman didn't like them, because she just left them behind on the shelf.
She measured three more panties until she decided that she didn’t like any of them and left the store.
It didn’t seem to bother her that someone was watching or thinking about the person who would buy the clothes she wears.
Mrs. Davidson (33 years old) from Kent says: "It's a good idea that someone will buy clothes that someone else has worn and that aren't washed afterwards."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson adds: "I assume that after her return, the store staff removed the said clothes from the store shelves - which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine that I could buy new underwear and find out that another woman has tolerated them and then they're not washed.
A representative of Primark said that Primark is known for the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9.
Concrete clothes are removed from the shelves of the store.
How to protect yourself from guns using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect yourself in close proximity from the attackers with a gun, we spoke with Krav Maga Grandmaster of New York Ron Mizraki.
Whether you are attacked from the front or back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and get over the attacker.
Mizraki indicates that if the attacker attacks from the back, then first it is necessary to turn to clearly see the attacker and avoid the trajectory of the shot.
Then the gun must be placed between your front arm and shoulder and must be placed in the face of the opponent with his free arm.
Then follow the skull with the path through the circle and until the attacker is stiffened in pain, he has to take off the gun, have to face with the gun skull and have to retreat, continuing to target the weapon against him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - it is necessary to avoid the trajectory of shooting, put a gun and disable it so that the attacker cannot be fired.
At the same time, the pressure on the gun must be applied and the opponent must be squeezed through his chest and finally he must remove the gun and retreat to continue the subject on him.
Sounds complicated, huh?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizraki does.
But remember, if you are not a Krav Maga master, then it is safer to give back your money to the thief.
The Vandal family demolishes the social house of Salta<0xC5><0xA1>a Kornvola and is placed on the street.
The Vandal family has been deposed from their place of residence for terrorizing neighbors, causing damage to the social home in the amount of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner Sean Trebilkok are very ill from the property in Salta<0xC5><0xA1>a Kornvola because several complaints have been lodged about them.
When they were forced to leave the property, shocked representatives of the Housing Service found that the property was completely demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, waste was dumped everywhere, and the walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now displaced from the property and most likely lives in some private property.
Donna Makevoy, Director of the Cornwall Housing Service, says there are concerns that the housing will not be possible to be restored.
She says that the people who lived here were extremely difficult and she thinks that people can’t live it.
In this case, several factors should be considered, because in the future this property in Kornvola will not have a good reputation.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three children, who have periodically stayed in possession and the police say that their terror turned out to be violence, the spread of baseball in the street, the intimidation of locals, the use of drugs, the sale of drugs and loud whistleblowing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was the property, was sentenced to anti-social conduct.
Waste found in several rooms of demolished houses.
In the house, where previously possible drugs are traded, there are also selected several floorboards.
Neighbors say that they regularly climbed the street and are constantly being called the police.
The Cornwall Housing Service removed them from the property when they were given 11 weeks to voluntarily get out of the house.
The disillusioned neighbors were very happy with the exhibition, because their life had been an absolute joy.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it has always been tricky.
It's amazing how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't go past this time.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we weren't used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's going to be wonderful here.
Adams Fitzpatrick, who is the Head of Neighbourhood Protection at the Cornwall Housing Service, said that the family did not cooperate with the local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and is regularly called the police.
A variety of old and unusable items were found in the growing garden of the house.
He also said: "It is very regrettable that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behavior, because leaving the house is always the last step considered by the Cornwall Housing Service."
This was a very complicated case, because their behavior was extreme and the neighbors had been very hard to monitor their behavior.
I appreciate the work of my entire team, the Devon and Cornwall police and community members who were brave and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will facilitate the lives of neighbours and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons here have lived in different periods of time, but all of them are about 20 years old.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after laying.
The staff of the service will now have to clean up the garbage pile left in the house.
In 2014, police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldone has only been found guilty of storing class B drugs for the purpose of distributing them.
She insisted that the money was intended to commemorate her son, Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the transfer, it became known that they are currently renting some private property in Plimov.
Many graffiti were painted on the walls of the house.
The police report that they will continue to depose tenants who violate their lease agreements.
Devon and Cornwall police spokesman Angela Krova says that this posture is an obvious warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said that: "This is a warning to those who believe that it may behave as it pleases and there will be no consequences for it."
Devon and Kronvola police are unacceptable criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The willingness to spend can give the economy an impetus.

The mayor of Cannabis will ban burkini swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort town of Kannu has banned the wearing of burkini swimsuits on the beaches of the city, which almost completely covers the body of a woman and resemble a water suit, local officials said on Thursday.
Cannes Mayor David Linares has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for everyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good customs and secularism" as the basic principle of the French Republic.
"The wear of a beach, which outwardly demonstrates religious belongings at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, can create a risk of disturbance of public order (stripping, collisions, etc.) that needs to be avoided," the order said.
"We're not talking about the ban on religious symbols on the beach, but on foreign clothes linked to the trust of terrorist movements that are at war with us," explained the municipality's head of communal services, Tieri Migul.
He added that burkini swimsuits on Kannu beaches have not been seen since 28 July, when the right-wing member of the central party "Republicans" Linares signed this order and it came into force.
This week, the aquapark in the city of Marseille canceled a planned private event for Muslim women wearing burkini in swimsuits, as the protests were expressed by right-wing and left-wing politicians.
In France, it is forbidden to wear face-covering Muslim women's headscarves, but religious symbols or appropriate clothing are not prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in the terrorist attack in the resort town of Kannam in Nice, for which the Islamic State group took responsibility.
On 26 July, two attackers who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State brutally killed priests in a church in the northwest of France.

The festival "Kubana" began in Lucavsala.
On Thursday, August 11, one of the last festivals of this summer in Lucavsala was given a start - there until Sunday nights will take place "Cubana".
On the first night of the meeting, bands such as "Enter Shikari" from the UK, who were expected to buy, but from the program without thinking disappeared, American banks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the band "The Prodigy" and others.
Also in the following days of the festival there are worthy words in the program - "Guano Monkeys" and "Garbage", the pancreatic legend "Ramones" wrestler Marky Ramon with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto & Lyapis" program "Brutto" and "Mrutto & Lyapis" in the pre-Russland,Midge,Serral pancreat.
This is the second year that the festival "Kubana" takes place in Latvia.
While it suffered financial failures and huge losses, it did not stop the organizers from repeating attempts - they added a length mark to the name, included a group of Latvians in the program, and a party of it (Friday night 19:15) and a party of "in the night" at the stage "in the staircase of the "Day R" and "All" notified.
Whether these efforts will justify, yet too early to judge, because the festival has just begun, but, as the first night observed "Delfi Entertainment", at least for the time being huge efforts to attract people have not failed and the number of visitors was similar to that of a pear.

The President who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgalam - 145.
On Friday, 12 August, 145 years have passed since the birth of the second President of Latvia Gustav Zemgals.
Zemgals proclaimed the State of Latvia, but has remained unprofitable in the shadow of the first President of Latvia J<0xC4><0x81>na <0xC4><0x8C>akste and the last President of the pre-war period K<0xC4><0x81>rl<0xC4><0x81> Ulman.
None of our fellow citizens have defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgale, as Arnold’s Report, in a book published ten years ago by Gustav Zemgale, writes.
In a conversation with the portal "Delfi" News emphasizes that Zemgale is one of the few politicians in high positions who have had a sense of humor.
The rest of such stiffs, always very right.
He was taught not to be such, today it could be similar to what Rymond Veyons is.
"He was the one who was close to the people," says the News.
Today's politicians know history poorly, they refer to Carly Ulman as a good leader, but rarely anyone knows how denialist he has been.
The only person in government meetings to whom he did not cry was General Balodis.
Even if in the pictures he is kind and smiling, by nature he was hysterical.
"The castle with its sense of humor and democracy leaves the exact opposite impression," says Ou<0xC5><0xBE>n<0xC5><0xA1>.
Aivars Strang, professor of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, agrees with "Delfi" to the opinion of the Minister of Foreign Affairs on Zemgal as a peaceful and weighed state man.
He also noted that Zemgals stood out with respect for minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At the time it was not an ordinary action, after the Presidency of the General Assembly Albert Kviss took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a quiet and weighed man that he had long wanted to be president.
He didn't run after it himself, he just didn't want fame.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not speak French, but he felt that the President should definitely understand it.
"I learned the basics of the French language during the presidency," explains Strange.
You can't even see how it works, but you can't see how it's going to work.
In any case, he is a very respectable person in the history of Latvia, he was in a serious position - he was a very demanding notary before arriving at the president's castle.
Zemgals also led the famous Zemgala Kasi Suvorova Street 3, where the company of stockbrokers and stockbrokers was located, in which practically the government became the state of Latvia in negotiations.
He was always progressively in a mood.
He was not a big fan of Ulman, but he was not publicly objected to either.
“In private talks, it has sometimes been said that Ulman’s actions really do not sympathize with him,” Stranga says.
There has been a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of illegality or corruption.
How does Zemgalu remember today?
Unfortunately, for the most part he associates himself with some street in Riga.
He was an absolute Democrat, his views were central.
“There were no major disturbances during his time, namely, he could be associated with such a stable presidency,” Strange summarizes.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgala, from 1927 to 1930, a visit to the State of Latvia to Sweden was also taking place, which indirectly meant for Latvia during that time full recognition in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the family of the democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgals visited the country in Stockholm.
The response of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but permanently left in January 1939.
Simple ways to help a child cope with anger strokes.
I often come across the fact that the child's anger, the appearance of disgust by parents is considered to be something wrong and abnormal.
When the child openly expresses his anger - we do not know how to react, "Econet" indicates the psychologist Yekaterina Kesa.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these natural and human feelings - the anger and disgust that every person periodically experiences.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we, adults, are angry, anxious - we usually know what is going on with us and how to deal with it.
We can express, oppress, hide, keep in us, tell about it to our friends or other loved ones, we can smash the sofa in anger, smoke cigarettes (this is not the best way to end up with anger, it's not the best way to calm down!
We do not focus our aggression on others because we know different ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when anger comes to them, do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say, ‘Go away!’, ‘You’re a fool’, ‘I don’t like you,’ ‘I’m not with you’ – and very rarely, when they can say, ‘I’m angry with you.’
Children live in the literal sense, they are completely right here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and truly express their senses, and often also find themselves in the possession of different emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prohibit the child from expressing feelings, including anger, not to be upset about it and fooled, but on the contrary - to help the child.
Do you need a break in a relationship?
A busy working day in which everything is not exactly the way you would like it, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you would like to "disconnect" for a moment, a day or even longer from all over the world.
Is it possible to pause the relationship for a moment and to get a little more rest?
But does this show that each of the partners is on their way?
They share their views of different ages.
J<0xC4><0x81>nis (23) is short and heartfelt: "In my view, if you need a break in a relationship, then you are not with the right person."
Meanwhile, Eduard (30) has unveiled a scheme that might help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to get nervous about you for every small detail, then certainly - this is the right time you should study other hunting fields to see if you miss her, or if you don't really think about her or don't even want to see her anymore.
So the answer is - yes, keeping a pause can help save time and understand how important the other half is for you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, the relationship should take a break from each other on a daily basis, because if you spend 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that each detail the other does, and it starts to fall on the nerves.
People are starting to cling to each other, especially when there’s nothing more to talk about than what you’ve done on a day-to-day basis.
My personal experience makes me think about it, so I haven’t been in a relationship for more than a few months either.
If you think for a moment that it's better somewhere else, then why is this woman you're with deserved someone who can think that they're not good enough and behind the mountains are the fields of paradise?
Thinking alone is already a small advantage.
If not, then not.
"I have, so a little condemn those who don't." says Edmunds (46).
K<0xC4><0x81>rl<0xC4><0xAB> (33) has the very opposite view of the tea.
I think we all need a moment for the studio.
You can't look at each moment, all the time, from morning to evening, in each other's eyes and bend over the inextinguishable love.
Attopias!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
You have your own time.
Of course, even a girlfriend or wife, however, if both of them maintain their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can survive even to the edge of the grave.
That and only that.
Marti<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> (27) says: "It is difficult to say - whether it is necessary or not, whether it is allowed or not to take a break, but one thing is clear - the proponent of it does not have anything in the relationship until the end, something is missing.
If this question arises, then it should be considered that in the near future there will be some change - on the right or the wrong side, it depends on itself.
I think while you are still young and thin, while you need a break - something all the time, but when everything is still serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, then there can be no talk about rest.
You decide to spend the rest of your life together!
“If you can’t withstand each other’s society now and need an atelier once in a while, what happens when you’re a retired person who comments on how cats feed or argue about which day the garden should be better fed,” Kristaps (19) explains.

With its captivating and captivating personality, Rozentals was the first to stimulate the interest of the Latvian people in visual arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain unforgettable forever," wrote Romans Suta about the old mayor of Latvian painting, Jani Rozentalu.
Also in 2016, the opening of the old mayor’s extensive retrospective exhibition in the main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art restored, is clear – Rozentals is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on August 12th, but from August 13th it is available to visitors and will be viewed until October 30th.

The retrospective exhibition, which covers more than 150 works, is one of the main events of the annual Jans Rozentala Jubilee Programme.
The selection of works of art is largely made up of the stock of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which strongly represents the main stages and genres of the creative activity of the classic, stylistical change and technical diversity.
In addition, exhibits from the Axeli Gallena-Kallela Museum, the Liepaja Museum, the Tukuma Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
The presence of photographs is revived by the centennial wind, the exhibition's mobile application reveals a separate artwork with photographs taken by the painter for the purposes of creativity himself with his camera.

A similar exhibition with a presentation of content in English, Finnish and Swedish will open in the autumn at the "Virka" gallery in Helsinki.
Wood Leblanc is looking forward to his return to the show "TopGear".
The head of the television broadcast "TopGear" ("Gas on the floor!") Matt Leblanc said that he is eagerly awaiting the return of the car show in the second season, but admitted that he does not know what the future awaits him.
Nothing is officially happening at the moment.
"If there is, then the BBC will announce it," Leblanc revealed in talks with television critics.

After the exit, Evans admitted that LeBlanc and "Gas on the floor!" were "as created for each other."
Evans's former "Friends" ("Friends") star is described as a "dangerous and scary man", thereby shouting rumors that the friendship of the two was deteriorating during filming.
When Leblankm asked what he liked most about the show, he replied that travelling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The TV channel BBC reports that the show is not planning to replace Evans in the new 24th season.

In Sigulda, on the Swiss street, two bicycles collided in various injuries, state police said.
The accident involved men born in 1987 and 1990, both of whom were transported to a medical institution.
You can also see a cyclist falling in Koknes.
In 1989, a man was born in a 1905 street, and was taken to medical care.
In 1989, a motorcyclist was born in Dobeles County, Naudytes County, to try to avoid the dog that ran off the road and crashed.
He's also in the hospital.
In the evening, 71 road accidents were registered in Latvia, in which 16 people were injured.

The U.S. model business is behind the scenes of his interpretation of the perverse glances of sophisticated photo sessions and the intolerance of horror movies.
In essence - a very provocative, balancing work on exquisiteness and banal vulgarity, in which the boundary lines between the European art house film and the Hollywood genre of product territory are difficult to obsolete.
In the main role of Vigo Mortensen, the question of whether the conceptually chosen life models of parents (ecologicalism, vegetarianism, alternativeism and limitations from the stupidity and values of consumer society) bring blessings or destructives to their children.
The father of six children, an idealist after the death of his wife, is confronted with questions about the correctness of choice and the true values.
A thrilling, life-threatening film by author Matt Ross won the Kannu Festival Award for Director this year.
Of course, the shark does it just as an attack on the fairy-tales - in the jungles it was a swimmer, in this case - a brave surfer, represented by Bleika Laivlija.
The work demanded her thorough heroism.
This survival solo number can be compared to James Frank's acting performance in the 127-hour film and Rayne Reinold's play Description Live.
Perhaps the main role of the painter Mila Kunis is also to blame, whose transformation from a model mother to a creative resident and thea’s family value seems to be created only by a completely disappointing fantasy of Hollywood scriptwriters.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
Islamic State militants, fleeing from Menbiz, Syria's Aleppo province, have seized about 2,000 civilians, who are used as living quarters, said Friday the U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arabic Alliance and observers.
“We shot them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Jerabush,” a spokesman for the Kurdish Military Council said.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Menbiz was freed from jihadists.
The Islamic State of Menbiz took over in 2014.
The QSD has already raised most of the Islamic State fighters from Menbiz last week, but some have resisted and have shown sectarian resistance.
On Friday, however, they abandoned the city, taking the fortress with them.
Islamists go to Jerrebulus, which is located on the Turkish border.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that the Islamic State had kidnapped some 2,000 people.
The SOHR reported that Islamists stole the cars of the city’s residents, forced people to slip into them, and then took them to Jerubaal.
Islamic State militants have also committed mass abductions in the past.
In January, Islamists seized the territory of Deir ez Zora province in eastern Syria and kidnapped more than 400 civilians, including women and children.
Later, about 270 Muslims were liberated from the pilgrimage.
How many Islamic State fighters have fled Menbiz is unknown.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Military Council of Menbiza reported that QSD managed to rescue 2,500 people held by Islamists in Menbiza.
The information collected by the SOHR indicates that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, were killed in the battle for Menbij’s life.
Killed 299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists.
Collegova renounces the nomination for the position of head of the VID.
The head of the National Environment Service, Inga Koljegova, decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of the National Revenue Service (VID), the agency LETA informed in the Ministry of Finance.
Koljegova notes that the discussion of her candidacy has raised controversy between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussion are related to the visible, but more often, invisible interests of politicians and they have nothing to do with my assessment of professional abilities.
“This is not acceptable to me either,” says the former candidate for the position of VID manager.
In case her candidacy would be approved by the government, it would be clear that it would not be a convincing vote and it would not allow the necessary changes to be fully worked and implemented by the VID, feeling the support of the whole government.
Without it, full-time work would not be possible, concludes Koljegova.
"First of all, I have publicly stressed that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment my entire candidacy process is too politicized," the official explains.
"Thank you for the trust and support you have shown me, it's an experience that I consider to be a benefit," writes Reizniece-Ozali Koljegova in his presentation.
The agreement on Wednesday stated that during the meeting with Kollegov there were "substantial contradictions" between the explanations of the candidate and the information available in the public registers on the costs of the dividends of SIA Pallogs, because the decisions of the meetings of the members of the Pallogs publicly available are intended not to divide the profits.
Currently, the functions of the head of the VID are carried out by the Deputy Director General Dace Grey.
In Lebanon, police are involved in the rescue of two unattended children, according to the Latgale Region Administration of the State Police.
You will be able to find out if you have any problems with your computer or if you have any problems with your computer.
They were located in Lebanon near the former store building.
The two little girls were immediately handed over to the doctors for assistance.
In addition, a bag with documents and a mobile phone was left in the cart.
In less than half an hour, law enforcement officers discovered the possible location of the children’s parents and went on.
When the woman entered the house of a civilian, the police found out that the woman was sleeping because she was in a strong mood for alcohol.
After the initial information on the previous day in the evening of 1992, a woman of the same sex came to the village of a friend, where she drank alcohol.
Already going home after a joint session, the woman decided to leave the children at the store in unclear conditions for the time being.
The police immediately informed the orphanage, which will also decide on the future fate of the child.
The Riga Freelancer has introduced all the recommendations of the VK regarding the Russian island project.
The Riga Free Administration has introduced all of the five recommendations of the State Control (UK) in relation to the development of the project Infrastructure on the Russian island for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, the portal Diena.lv informed the company.
Approval of the project was planned at the next meeting of the Riga Free Board.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with VK’s view in the preparation of the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Free Administration was also led by the international auditor Deloitte Riga Free Administration in the legal and operational audit conclusions and the project guides provided.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the UK today.
Despite the fact that the Riga Free Administration does not agree with the opinion prepared by the UK on the usefulness of the implementation of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the donor - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all planned construction works within the project are fully completed within the time limits and in the planned amount.
"To demonstrate to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the UK and also the stiffeners, that the main objective of the release is the successful implementation of the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the UK regarding the issues of project management and supervision," says the director of the project, Kaireita.
The existing long-term action plan for monitoring and monitoring the achievement of the project objective was supplemented by the main planned actions of the stakeholders and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, meetings and regular disclosures, as well as the definitions and deadlines for the designs, the planning of the processes.
The approved action plan for achieving the project objective by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the UK, is complemented by performance monitoring activities, thereby strengthening the control of the deadlines of the activities of the other parties involved in the implementation of the project by the Free Party of Riga.
To improve project management and mitigate potential risks, a project management plan has been redeveloped, defining the areas of project management and specifying the documents developed, providing a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the capacity of the project, a project management structure scheme has been developed that reflects the planned project management team structure, staff qualifications and functions.
In order to improve the communication of the Riga Free Administration with the parties involved in the project, a plan of communication of the stakeholders in the project has been developed, which, in addition to the parties specified in the project action plan, defines the objectives for the successful completion of the project.
On the other hand, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the commencement of a procurement and the rule of law will need to be further substantiated.
Within the framework of the project, the Russian island has been built a world-standard port infrastructure - four new deep-sea ports, railway drives, as well as engineering communications.
The co-financed constructions of the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of the previous year, with savings of EUR 10.6 million.
Due to friendships, increased security at airports in Slovakia.
After receiving non-specific threats, Slovakia on Friday reinforced security measures at several airports, the Ministry of Interior said.
"In view of the threats, we have strengthened security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ice," a spokesman for the Slovak Ministry of Interior told AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analyzing the information we have received," he added.
An informal summit of the European Union (EU) will take place in the Slovak capital on 16 September, with the participation of all the countries of the bloc except the United Kingdom.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of Britain’s Brexit referendum and discuss the EU’s future without Britain.
Until January, Slovakia is the EU Presidency.
German researchers discuss the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of deaths at the communist jungle in the former Eastern Frontier could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the actual number of victims remain unclear.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, near the border with the Western Communist Zones and later the Communist authorities of the West captured 1,841 people who tried to get out of control.
The Museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and adjusts the number of casualties from time to time.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including among the victims a six-year-old boy who died while trying to get to West Germany through then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are also Soviet army deserters.
"The extent of the last damage done by the double crime of communism and socialism is not yet fully documented," admits Aleksandra Hildebrande, director of the museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died while trying to escape the communist-controlled state are buried and not disappeared," Hildebrandes said in a statement.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The number of 1841 is unconvincing," says Johann Stats, expert in Eastern History at the Berlin Free University, in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He, together with other researchers at the Berlin Free University, is currently reviewing possible suspected deaths at the border, and so far they have managed to confirm only 260 cases.
Previously, researchers estimated that only 138 people were killed by the Communists near the Berlin Wall.
Taking into account those people who have died trying to escape through the Baltic Sea or to get to the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, the State believes that the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, it is much less than in 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide by Eastern Border Guards, regardless of whether they were directly linked to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not related to direct violence.
"If seniors between the ages of 70 and 80 after cross-border control die from heart disease," it should have the consequences of this "sleeping border," says Hildebrande.
However, the State is convinced that a distinction must be made between the old people who may have died as a result of their treatment and those who died due to prolonged waiting in a hot bus at the border.
Regardless of its casualties, listing is not easy, as the Communist Eastern authorities did not accumulate such statistics, and researchers need to educate the documents in various archives, states the Statist.
However, the Statute Group has recently drawn up new documents, and it could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
LPF President Pone went to Rio with the accreditation of the trainer; for himself it is a surprise.
In recent days, the President of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), Kaspars Pone Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro, has come to the Olympic Games with the accreditation of the coach, yet he feels surprised about it himself.
On Wednesday, a widespread aggravation was caused by the statements of Olympic swimmer Alon Ribakova, coach Germana Yakubovska, who revealed that at the last minute decided to go to Riodejaneiro to Pone while the coach is staying at home.
Initially, the list of drivers was approved by swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalni<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, coaches Jakubovskis and Deivs Kolinss, as well as federation president Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied for five participants for the Olympics, and even before the departure Aldons Vrubljevskis claimed that the Germans will be and he is looking for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons he was not," Pone said, stating that this did not affect Ribakova's result.
At the request of the federation, Uvia's coach decided to help her.
Mr. President, who is himself a member of the Executive Committee of the LOK, criticized the activities of the LOK by blaming the Olympic sports supervising organisation.
In my view, it is unethical to approve five persons in the Executive Committee of the LOK and one of them will not be excluded.
"I don't know exactly why the Swimming Federation didn't have enough space," Mr. Pone said that the work of the federation and its presidents was not appreciated in society, reminding that the federation presidents do not receive salaries.
Also, Pone criticized himself Jakubovski, stating that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send sports.
He could not tell why he had the accreditation of the coach at the Olympics, who was most likely to be responsible for Jakubovsky.
“I was applied for as a federation president (“team leader”), but for unknown reasons I received the accreditation of a coach and now I’m nowhere in.”
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last minute I thought the Germans would be, because I had no other information.
According to the information available to the agency LETA, a few days before the start of Ribakova she had an eye-to-eye conversation with Poni and after her swimmer had been with tears in her eyes, however, the LPF president himself said that it was a daily conversation with the desire to start sports.
Pone recalled that the LPF monitors five sports that are included in the Olympic programme, and four of them are also training children in Latvia.
The President of the federation said that in Latvia there is also a very important issue of congestion and also he talked about such programs, since Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro has been there for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that in 2018 Latvia could take place the World Cup stage.
Being in Rio de Janeiro is not my holiday, I work here, I spend my time and I try to implement the quarterly programmes.
You will receive 600,000 salmon babies in Daugava.
During the programme for the restoration of fish resources of AS Latvenergo in Daugava this week, salmon and mollusks are introduced near Mangalesalas, and this year it is planned to introduce more than 600,000 annual salmon and mollusk mollusks, grown in the scientific institute of Bior Tomes and Doles Ziza.
Letvenergo agency LETA informed that the entry of fish will continue for the next months - 6,300,000 different species of fish are admitted to the Daugava basin each year.
In the spring and early summer of 2016, the slopes of the slopes and the nails will be released, in June - the slopes, in July - the one-summer salmon, in August and September - the sandstones and the vimbas.
Latvenergo Production Director M<0xC4><0x81>ris Ku<0xC5><0x86>ickis said that care for the environment is one of the cornerstones of Latvenergo Group’s sustainable development.
"In the conservation and reproduction of fish resources measures, every action is focused on environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, in both the breeding and entry of small fish into the Daugava basin, and in the realization of other activities," Ku<0xC5><0x86>icki said.
This year, more than 600,000 annual salmon and pastry babies will be introduced into Daugava’s soil.
Already in the second year, fish babies before entering are marked by cutting fatty tissue.
Today the cargo has 25,000 salmon babies with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, in the composition and numerical quantity of the scientifically justified species in Daugava and its pool waterfalls, fish infants and turtles are introduced.
The breeding of fish resources in Daugava and its basin is carried out by Bior in accordance with the legislation, based on the analysis of the losses caused by the economic activity of Latvenergo on the fish resources and providing a conclusion on what compensatory measures are to be taken in order to ensure a large amount of information.
The National Environmental Service, on the basis of that expertise, decides on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual compensation amount of Latvian Energy in the fish resource recovery programme is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,035,000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the company "We fish" for the fifth year, places 400 artificial fish nest lizards in Daugava near Kaibala and Ik<0xC5><0xA1>ila.
Cooperation with the public in promoting the natural catch of fish is an initiative supported by Latvenergo as part of the fish resource recovery programme.
The placement of artificial ponds in the water reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugava.
The festival "Sansusi Concert Hall" is a country courtyard, forest, circus.
Sleeping in a tent, eating as a restaurant, walking around and listening to explored chamber music, enjoying the quiet natural peace, - such a combination offers an alternative chamber music festival in Sansusi, which already invites for the third summer in Akniste district.
The festival will take place in Susa - a village that no longer exists - in the former farmhouse yard, next to the forests and hills.
Three days - from 12 to 14 August - you can combine a carefree and exquisite enjoyment of natural and academic music on five stages.
Here, the theatre and the contemporary circus, performances and installations are encountered with music.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest expressions, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the stiffness of the concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but until the smile in the face and the lightness in the legs only a few minutes.
"Please do not look for the program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not attend one particular event or an artist, because the true taste of Sansusi can only be recorded by spending all three days in it," says the initiator and host of the festival.
The opening of the festival will take place on Friday at 17:00, and the first concert will take place at 19:00.
Of course, there will be programs with all the information on the site.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most satisfying - from 9 a.m. to the next morning.
"The names of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", says Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.

Reid argues that if Clinton is elected as president, she will appoint Garland as the Supreme Court Judge.
The leader of the Senate Democratic Party, Harry Reid, is confident that if he becomes president, he will appoint Mary Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Republican Party of the Senate has blocked Garland's approval since he was nominated by President Obama in March.
The majority leader of the Senate, Mi<0xC4><0x8D> Makonnel, said that the next president will choose to replace the current Supreme Court judge Antonin Skali.
On Thursday, during his conference, Reid announced that he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.
The representative of Reida later stated that he had not personally spoken about this subject with Clinton and that it was only speculation.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "shut the boat" with another choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. District Court of Appeals.
Reid said that the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "inserts" and are acting in the interests of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump was not fit for the president's job.
Treats announces a collage photo calendar for women and men.
Treats magazine will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar of Pirelli in the style of the 70s of the last century.
In its 2017 NU M<0xC5><0xAB>su calendar, it is planned to showcase new supermodels rather than celebrities.
Earlier this year, Treats magazine president Steve Shows said that his erotic arts magazine is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a men's magazine".
This magazine is for women.
He also seems to be talking about the calendar.

The buyer, when trying a motorcycle, drops.
On August 10, at 10 a.m., a motorcycle "Yamaha YZ250" was stolen from a house in the courtyard of Rembates, which was not registered, the State Police reported.
The owner of the motorcycle, with the help of the advertisement, wanted to sell the power.
In the appointed time, a potential buyer arrived, stepped on a motorcycle as if to try it and left.

Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video view
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks are the freshest ever vertebrates on our planet.
Fisherman Julius Nielsen says that the record for longevity belongs to a woman who could be 272 to 512 years old and five meters tall.
The French court rejects the lawsuit against the demolition of shops in the Jungle Refugee Camp.
The French court rejected the Calypso authorities' demand for the demolition of dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the Jungle Camp, home to thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing in Calais this week, authorities stated that the state should mix 72 self-made shops where people trade different goods in the camp, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offers hairdressing services, tea for 50 cents in a single restaurant (40p).
The prefecture’s office pointed out that these self-manufactured companies must be rebuilt because they constitute a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian group representatives explained to the Court that these small enterprises are essential because the food provided by government and support groups does not provide for the needs of the camp, where the number of residents continues to increase.
They also pointed out that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those who need it most.
The Lille court ruled that there is no legal basis for expelling the people who created 72 self-made shops, but it understands the concerns of the Kale Prefecture.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food to people who live "in extremely harsh conditions".
He pointed out that these places are a peaceful meeting place for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of collapse is the camp's Jungle Book Kids cafe, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French-speaking lessons and provides advice on asylum matters to hundreds of vulnerable minors without adult escort.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children’s cafeteria.
A letter addressed to the Guardian stated that the liquidation of the café "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years of age."
On Friday, the two charity organizations "Refugee Assistance" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" reported that the number of residents of the "Jungle" camp has increased to 9,000, the highest rate since the rapid flooding of migrants in the summer.
Britain gains silver in the Rugby-7 series battle, when the Fiji National Unit masterfully beats gold.
The impressive performance of the British team in the rugby-7 stage ended on Thursday, when the Fiji national team reassured them with a score of 43:7 at the exciting final at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.
Fiji demonstrated masterclasses in ball management, ball playing with legs, supporting game and brutal power game, fighting gold - the first Olympic medal in the history of its existence.
Sakave brought a worthy reconciliation award - a silver medal, which was the third British medal at the time. The British team can be proud of their success in the first Olympic rugby-7 tournament, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In a weak semi-final, in which the Box team suffered a breakdown with a score of 7:5 in the first half of the day, the UK may have played in the final.
But in any case, Fiji's selection is now in its best form to also win the 15 men's team.
While unlikely, however, a certain relief for Britain could be the fact that at least one Briton won a gold medal. This is Fiji's top coach Ben Rayens - the former England coach from Wimbledon.
For the UK, it was an exciting adventure.
Eight years ago, under Ryan’s leadership, they lost all games in the stage of the rugby-7 series in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
The root is painful, but the growth is amazing.
The Fiji started the game impressively, releasing the techniques of the British force joy after.
Captain Tom Michel and his teammates, it was like a collision with a number of bus drivers and World Series champions emerged in the lead with 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau won the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased the excess by realising the right-wing landing.
The result was 12:0 and the British team didn’t even really touch the ball.
Mitchell’s great power technique did not allow the ugly Leoni Nakarava to score three points, but it only slightly affected Fiji’s result.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalua won a right-hand corner landing, reinforcing the dominance over Britain to 17:0.
After the overshoot, Nakarava increased the overshoot even further, and until the end there was more than a minute left... to the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some unsuccessful British force techniques and crossed the line by earning points.
The landing provided a score of 29:0.
It is believed that Fiji was born to play rugby-7 games while the British are still just learning.
In fact, it is also true.
The British team made a profound change in the half-life by crossing the Fiji player line... the full four minutes, which were good after the first half, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team match, gained a few more points in the Fiji team.
For the first time in the UK, Norton was able to score points in favour of the British team by landing in the left corner and achieving a score of 36:7, but the game had already been lost, while South Sea saline fans sang, drew the flags and danced in the stands.
You can’t be surprised at Fiji’s life-saving attitude.
Mata William made Fiji’s victory even sweeter with another landing at the end of the game.
At the end of the game, Fiji was able to start celebrating, but the British only had the ability to sit on the farm after the breakup.
In the first half of the day, Fiji defeated Japan by 20:5, while the British were ahead of South Africa, where in a very fierce battle both teams were defeated and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half, Kaylee Browns led the Boxing team, but in the second half, Denn Norton crossed the line with brilliant skill and brought the ball between the teams, providing the British a victory.
Marcus Watson, the brother of Antony, England’s 15-team rugby player, gave the team a victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
The coach’s fight against cancer inspired Helen Glover and Hetero Staning to win the race.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last crucifixion, the golden moment of Helena Glover and Heteros Staning played a special role in the Estacio da Lagoa route.
Although there are only two athletes on board, she was accompanied by the support of Robin Williams, which inspired her to get even the second Olympic gold medal in the pairing of women, becoming the first women in the history of British sport to have won such a pan.
She was undoubtedly dominated because for the 39th time she won an unprecedented, unprecedented victory.
Both great athletes with the elegance of the swing sliding over the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind each gold medal earned stands a whole team that works hard to keep athletes improving their performance and the greatest contribution to their success was given by a coach who, even 30 months ago, did not know if they were going to live this day.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated on and also happened.
If I didn't, it would spread throughout my body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
This changes your vision a little bit.
The cancer of Williams was discovered in December 2013.
This trio succeeded that William could start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the interseason in 2014 and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if it can be said.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulates the recovery.
I was in the hospital and I traveled 6, 10 and even 15 meters long, although the doctor said it would be enough with a few steps.
It all started.
It is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about Williams, who was very worried all morning and spoke more than usual under the impression of excitement.
Staning, who has served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: "It was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
It only confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The three years spent with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have achieved anything, so huge thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I can’t imagine a better workout member or better trainer.
Helen Glover and Hetero Stanning have not lost in any race in five years.
The couple reaches such a huge speed that competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started approaching, Stanning and Glover’s preponderance was too high.
We feel every moment.
Helen shouts, "Keeps the rhythm, keeps the rhythm."
Don’t lose focus is really important.
We had a good start, but at the same time we did not have high hopes.
On that day, we did not intend to break records, but simply to air well and win the races, and we did it too.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month will be the wedding of Glover and TV adventure seeker Steve Bashal.
For now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
It would have been too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very worried.
This time, it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is amazing."

You are the only one who has the right to do so.
According to her, it is now "primarily important" for Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>rim Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski (Green and Farmers Union) and Finance Minister Danai Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers Union) to approve the position of Head of the VID.
Rajevsky believes that the approval of the leader of the VID in this government, both Kucinski and Reizniece-Ozal, is "the first big decision" that could affect him as a politician's future.
If they now start to change their position in the choice of a candidate for the position of head of the VID, then this will have a negative impact on their imaging state administration.
The agenda for the next week's meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the issue of the transfer of VVD Head Koljegova to the post of Director-General of the VID, the government's agenda shows.
The position of head of the VID in Koljegov was moved to the position of Minister of Finance Reizniece-Ozola after the resignation of Inára Petersone from the management of the service and when the competition for the position of Director General of the VID ended without a result.
In the interview on Thursday, August 11, Dace Grey, executive director of VID, allowed Latvian Radio - if she was offered to run for the position of manager, then she could agree.
The Minister of Finance later acknowledged that no other candidates for the position of head of the VID were being considered for the time being.
The head of the Saeima Group of the National Association also acknowledged that the NA continues to support Koljegov’s VID leadership.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit is undermined by the inability to form a government.
On 12 July, the European Commission (EC) expressed its opinion that Spain and Portugal had not implemented sufficient measures to reduce the budget deficit to the required 3% of the GDP (GDP) of the euro area.
Calculations show that despite the austerity measures implemented, the budget deficit in Portugal at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP, and in Spain - 5.1%.
However, the European Commission has decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries while setting fiscal targets for the near future.
However, one of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions on both of these countries is the growing euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative moods.
Critics point out that the EC is not coherent in its decisions by agreeing on common rules from the outset and not being able to apply them in life.
For example, German Bundesbank President Jens Waidmann pointed out that Europe is losing confidence in itself by creating the public's impression that the rules of the European Union are advisable, not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved an extension of the deadline for fixing the deficit to Portugal by the end of this year and to Spain by 2018.
The European Commission pledges to review the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while noting that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if the conditions so require.
Initial forecasts show that Portugal’s target could be achieved within the timeframe set and that the budget deficit could be reduced to 2.5% of GDP already this year.
This means that in the framework of the Stability Programme, the government of this country must implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with additional attention being paid to the cost of procurement of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year's budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, consolidation measures should be 0.5% of GDP annually for the next two years.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have not been able to agree on the establishment of a government for eight months makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and there is an increasing possibility that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, public opinion polls show that the political landscape of the third election in the country would not change significantly.
The most popular party is the popular party led by the current Prime Minister Mariano Rahoja, whose votes would regain less than 33% of the vote.
The popularity of the party "Podems" or "Together we can" and "Citizens" or "Citizens" against austerity measures has increased slightly, while the popularity of the party "Podems" or "Together we can" or "Citizens" has decreased slightly.
The People's Party wants to achieve the participation of the Socialists and Citizens in the government this month, otherwise it will not be possible until mid-October to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval the draft 2017 budget.
As Rafael Hernando, the representative of the People's Party's parliamentary group, said, if the establishment of a government fails and parliamentary elections are still held for the third time, Spain will become a mockery of the whole of Europe.
The cleanliness of beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
When surveying the beaches for the fifth year, the activists concluded that unfortunately, the number of waste found annually increases, and this is the main culprit of the swimmers.
The most polluted swimming areas are directly in Riga.
The capital’s curiosity explains that swimming spots are buried every day, but it is very difficult to fight dirty visitors.
In addition, the waste left in the land during rainfall can be washed into water, thereby seriously deteriorating its quality.
With the exception of Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja beaches and separate places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This week's announcement was circulated by the volunteers of the "My Sea" campaign.
When measuring the road along the Gulf of Riga in the fifth year, activists concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every one hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year, this critical assessment has come in handy.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of wastes on the beach 100 meters, possibly can even exceed 200 units," says the representative of the expedition "My Sea" J<0xC4><0x81>nis Ulme.
When he was called by Latvian Radio, he was on the beach of Tuya, where he will continue his volunteer walk along the Gulf of Riga.
This year, among the various household wastes and picnics, even daylight bulbs left in the sand of the seabed by the remaining activists have to be collected.
The traveller and organizer Ulme says that the pollution is directly the culprits of the population.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total number of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, pieces of plastic that are already in the stage of decomposition, they can no longer be identified, and smokes, bottles",
Among the dirtiest beaches there are also swimming areas in Riga.
For example, an average of almost 800 waste units are collected every 100 meters in Daugavpils, which is a critical amount.
The organizers of the campaign also explain that I also smoke smoke every step of the way and do not place any warning or prohibition marks everywhere.
"The average figures for all three swimming areas in Riga together - Daugavgrivu, Vakarbu<0xC4><0xBC>li and Elders - unfortunately gather large and far beyond the desired goal, which is to reduce the number of waste units to 135 by 2020," the environmental statement concludes.
Cleaning of pools in Riga takes place every day, even twice on the hottest summer days, explains the representative of the town hall, U<0xC4><0x9F>is Vidauskis.
However, the fight with the dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We are going back to the cultural issue of these people.
"For those who use fertilizer, alcohol, smoke and do all the things that should not, even special signs do not work," says Midauskis.
This is why Midauskis invites swimmers to report pollutants to the police.
You can call the police, safely point to these violations and in this way fight everyone.
You may be able to apply some new warnings, but, as I said, it will hardly change the situation radically.
"Because we all just have to turn and be intolerant to such perpetrators," he stresses.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements have already been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which may impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, like other years, the quality of the water is everywhere good and satisfactory.
The current situation is that the quality of the water in all 56 bathing areas has always been good and there are no swimming restrictions.
"For the last time we will take the analyses at the end of August," says Normand Kadi<0xC4><0x8D>is, the senior environmental health specialist of the inspection.
During heavy rainfall, land-based waste can be washed into water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, says an environmental expert.
Rotation in the Russian elite continues - change of leader in Putin's administration.
Do you love it yourself?
Vladimir Putin told the Russian media that Sergei Ivanov left the post himself and will be the President’s Special Representative for Nature Conservation, Ecology and Transport.
In announcing the changes, Mr. Putin gave Ivanov a welcome speech in front of the television camera: "Previous Sergei Borisovich, we have been working with you for many years and we are doing it successfully."
I am pleased with how you are fulfilling the responsibilities entrusted to you.
I remember well our agreement not to use you in this position of President of the Administration for more than four years.
That is why I am understandingly opposed to your desire to change the field of action.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in the new position.
However, it is pointed out that the leadership of the presidential administration is a very important role and this made Ivanova one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the fact that the state council elections in Russia are to be held in the coming months, there are rumors that this step is linked to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called Putin's possible deputy president, so the claim that he himself wanted to take on the position of the president's representative for nature conservation and transport has raised doubts.
As the Lsm.lv archive shows, Ivanov is the head of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanovs has been meaningful and close to Russian President Vladimir Putin's societal partners.
He started his career in specdienes in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
In turn, at the end of the reign of the first Russian President Boris Yeltsin was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, the "Information Security Doctrine" developed by Ivanova was approved, which included the revival of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became the Minister of Defence of Russia, but in 2005, he was the deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and arms exports.
Now, after the president’s resignation as head of the administration, Ivanov will also retain a place in the Russian National Security Council, where the new president’s head of the administration will also work.
The blame comes from the elite of the family Soviet party.
The position of head of the President’s administration was recommended by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardovich and I have been known for a long time.
Since the time when we were working in government under your leadership.
And for the last almost five years we've been in touch virtually every day.
"Therefore, I am confident that after all the professional and personal qualities of character he is ready for this work," said Ivanov.
The blame comes from a family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet party.
Her grandfather Karl took up senior positions in the Communist Party of Estonia, including ten years until 1988, he was its first secretary.
The Internet edition "Meduza" with reference to the book "Estonian Self-Determination and Independence" writes that at the end of the 1980s Karl Vaino had asked Moscow to give permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he had received a rejection and soon lost his position.
Soon after, Vaino moved to live in Moscow.
Anton Vaino is a graduate of the Moscow Institute of International Relations and a master of the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President’s minutes.
It has already been reported that in the last few months, Russia has been shocked by the deportation and even arrests of several high-ranking officials, including replaced governors of several districts and federal representatives.
As political scientists point out, President Vladimir Putin is reorganizing the ruling elite before the 2018 election.
One of the main features - more and more often at the leading positions are the representatives of the structures of the force.
Also the judo runner Nikiforenko loses the Olympics in the first battle.
This was the fight in the first round, and the Latvian Judo Race has ended its participation in the Olympics, finishing in 17th place.
If you are a member of the Board of Directors of the European Commission, you will be asked to provide the following information to the Board of Directors:
He also discovered that a wrist injury was sustained in the fight.
It is remarkable that, in order to be at the Olympics, <0xC5><0xBD>ikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than the usual - namely, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani racetrack weighed more than 25 kilograms.
It has already been reported that Yevgeny Borodavko in the fight in the weight category up to 100 kilograms against Ryunosuki held for two-and-a-half minutes until the opponent achieved a net victory worth a shot.
So the Latvian Judo competition Rio has ended.
Dreams disappear in the sands of Rio.
What is the best way to do this is to make sure that you have the right to do it.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent against him, but his ambitions can sometimes surprise him.
He didn't say.
Art<0xC5><0xAB>r <0xC5><0xBD>ikiforenko’s task was even more difficult, as the experience was less and the opponent was also respectable.
The result is similar, although on the tatami he held the tea for a minute and a half longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, lately, Latvian Judicialists have been lacking the most ambition.
Since the leadership of the federation passed Gun<0xC4><0x81>r Chirson and his financial stute Vladimir <0xC5><0xA0>etakov, from Latvia Aleksandrs Jackevi<0xC4><0x8D>, no longer occurs "Golden Score" - the development of judo rides down the slope.
Jackevich, who is advising the Jews of Kazakhstan here, and Vsevoldam Zelooni is not seeing the heirs.
But if it doesn't burn, it won't.
And that is the prerogative of the federation.
Therefore, as from the other galaxy "R<0xC4><0xAB>ta panorama", the promise of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation of Rio to win medals was sung.
A flight far from reality.
We were looking forward to the beach volleyball matches Samoilov/<0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x9B>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> - Evandra/Pedra Solbergs.
Intrigue as already in the "death" group - losers the game is over.
In the case of the Latvian duo, there was a small derogation - it was also possible to lose, but not more than four points in two sets.
The tension was still increased in the long run of the previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling swirled over the windy court throughout the length of the match.
For the players, the wind caused additional complications in the brazilian wind.
At first, it seemed that it could be our ally, which is the most complete.
But it didn't.
It was quite simple to play against the Latvian duo here.
Serve as much to Samuel and wait for him to break.
The first set was split against Canada at the end and the third set at the beginning, because the load was not in a hurry.
At that time, the fisherman was able to fish, because the work was small, but when it was, he did it in honor.
If you are a member of the Board of Directors of the European Commission, you will be asked to provide the following information to the Board of Directors of the European Commission:
If you are a member of the European Union, you will be able to share your personal information with the European Parliament and the European Parliament.
The third was already thrilled in the sign of Evander's serfdom.
Formed in a chain - inconveniently captured server, the second game often flies too close to the network and Samoilov left quite a few options for the resulting attack.
If there was a foreign Samoilov in the field against the Cubans, then this time he was more successful, and only in Saxony the loss would be unprofessional.
Also, Craig was wrong, and quite symbolic that the last block of the ball was hit by him.
The team loses.
This time it was definitely a success too - in the third set only two Evander attacks almost flew out of the court, but the ball still hit the line.
Two tracks were next to the line.
Also the controversial episodes of the video decided for the good of the opponents.
When Evandra played with the Serbs in the first two games, they were very productive against ours.
All of them totaled losses on the table.
The causes of failure should now be calmly analysed.
Perhaps as many people should have lived next to the stadium, not with a delegation in the Olympic village.
We spent two and a half hours on the road.
Perhaps a little self-confidence came from a series of seven semi-finals.
Perhaps you shouldn't have played in Kägenfurt, but you should have come here faster and better aclimatize.
Perhaps there was an error in finding the top of the sporty shape.
For now, there are more questions than answers.
The game for our diners is over.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments left and also Jurmala's "Masters".
You will not be able to see the results of your research, but you will not be able to see the results of your research.
But that's not necessary either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals is broken, the idea of separation can also arise, because the blame will be sought not only for itself but also for the partner.
It is not difficult to separate, but it will be much harder in Latvia to find a decent partner.
Both brothers are playing balls, but Janis and Tom have already tried and also slipped, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the tops of the world.
You can try Harald Regge, Aleksandr Solovej, Edgar Toc, to return to the Martyrs' Prince, but it will not be better than this option, which has proven itself not once in the World Cup stages.
The Kopakabanas sands weren't crazy for them this time.
A certain.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new pairs are entering into circulation, and only the rare plant is less than two meters.
This does not yet guarantee success, but is an important argument in the fight for victory.
We don't have any longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to feed in the venues offered by the game organizers, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Kopakabana.
This time, very high prices were demanded for all the decent accommodations offered by journalists.
Therefore, the choice also falls on the apartment rental.
The risk is because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich for rent apartments on the borders of Kopakabana and Ipanema.
Beach 200 meters away, half an hour's walk from the B<0xC4><0xAB><0xC4><0x8D>a arena.
The area is quite safe because the favela’s paw, but you should not lose your wisdom too.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some think at once, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It looks like another medal dream was dreamed out on Friday morning.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidi<0xC5><0x86>a, 100 metres in the barrier crossing and high-altitude, has set her personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After 10 years of break "Porgie and Besa" song in Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja.
In Latvia, the opera "Porgis and Besa" was first studied in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been won again.
That is why the organizers of the C<0xC4><0x93>su Arts Festival and the Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Arts Forum have decided to give listeners the opportunity to enjoy the masterpiece of George G<0xC4><0x93>r<0xC5><0xA1>vin in close cooperation.
"We are very happy that after a ten-year break, when Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja was able to last enjoy the study of the opera, this great version of the concert studio of the opera "Porgies and Besa" by George G<0xC4><0x93>r<0xC5><0xA1>vin is enjoyable with us in the new concert" in the new concert"the newly opened concert" in the "Little Concert Hall" said.
Opera "Porgie and Besa" is a story about love, its instability, passion, as well as family tragedies and simple everyday joys told in a bright musical language.
It reflects African-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance that makes it so vivid.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," says director Viesturs Kairi<0xC5><0xA1>s.
What I like most about - listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stops - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another character, or choir, or orchestra.
"It's the most exciting, this building," the opera is appreciated by the musical director and conductor of the concert studio Andris Poga of the opera Porgies and Besa.
Visitors to the opera agree that this is a grandiose event.
They are very happy to hear this world-famous Gurschwin opera.
It’s a good idea to have a breath of life in Liepaja.
"Performance professional", the opera is evaluated by the visitor Edgars L<0xC4><0x81>ms.
The concert studio was special in that the orchestra played for the first time in the newly opened concert hall "Big Dinner" in the orchestra cradle and the concert was performed for the first time.
The area near the renovated building of the Museum of Art could be named in the name of Ja<0xC5><0x86>a Rozentala.
Riga Deputy Mayor Andris Ameriks Rozental in the opening of the Anniversary Exhibition said that the museum’s own address in the future could be not Kri<0xC5><0xA1>j<0xC4><0x81>na Valdem<0xC4><0x81>ra Street 10a, but Jan<0xC5><0xA1>a Rozental Square 1.
The director of the museum, M<0xC4><0x81>ra L<0xC4><0x81>ce, acknowledged that re-registration of addresses would create a serious bureaucratic burden, but overall this idea was welcomed and therefore agreed to the municipal proposal.
In 1936, the city of Riga built a foundation for this idea, creating a memorial to Janim Rozental, who stands next to the museum.
Vilhelms Purvitis, then director of the museum, was one of the initiators of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I am a little bit of a conscience all the time - but Wilhelm Purvitis, where are we going to put his name?!
"But if you, Mr. America, pledge to think," said Lace.
It is said that the National Museum of Art, after an ambitious reconstruction and modernization, officially closed its doors in May this year.
This week, the reconstruction of the VEF Cultural Palace will finally begin.
You will receive approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11 million from VELVE.
It is planned to renovate several palace spaces, including two spectator halls, as well as the building to adapt to people with mobility disorders.
The Riga City Hall intends to raise the European Union funds in the amount of six million euros for the project, but Oleg Burovs, Director of the Department of Properties of the Riga City Hall, acknowledges that the European funds for the project are not yet fully clear.
"Despite the political will to start the repair work of the VEF Cultural Palace by attracting European Structural Funds, we have been waiting for months for the decision, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether or not that money will be allocated," says Burovs.
In December last year, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission stating that Brussels is not taking a decision here.
We are now seeing another round of discussions again, so let's see what we can expect in the coming days.
“It is difficult to say that Riga Cathedral certainly guarantees that this process will be initiated and completed within the deadline,” says Burovs.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Cultural Palace collectively held the inaugural concert before immediately, immediately expected renovation of the building.
Although a year passed, the renovation of the building had not yet begun and collectively continued to work under unsuitable conditions.
In the strategy of the Riga City Hall of Property Department, the renovation of VEF Culture Castle was divided into seemingly independent sets of reconstruction works, each of which will ensure the implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is to increase the availability of VEF Cultural Castle and to improve the surrounding area.
It aims to arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as to restore the facades of the building.
Second - Improvement of the offer of VEF Cultural Palace services.
It plans to improve the study of interior, wall and ceiling restoration, stage and sound recording, as well as the arrangement of the building’s internal engineering communications.
Third - Improvement of collective working conditions of creative amateurs, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, room heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "Livu" the legendary rock band can be introduced to the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will display various "Live"-descriptive objects - photographs, which are arranged in the timeline, to reflect the group's activity from the beginning until 2010, when the end of the group's activity is announced.
It will also show the costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert records of the participants, as well as other things that have not yet been seen to the general public, which reflected the creative activity of the group "Live".
The exhibition will be supplemented with items of stock of the Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Museum.
Visual design of the exhibition carpet in cooperation with the fashion artist and painter Elit Patmalnieci.
Also, the musicians who had been associated with the group "Lewis" and their relatives, responded to the invitation and shared both objects and memories.
The beginnings of "Livu" can be found in 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble, led by Yuri Pavitols, was formed in the cultural house of Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja.
In its original composition, the ensemble participated in the festival "Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja dintar" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in city and republic scenes.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place when Juris Pawitols introduced <0xC3><0x84>rik <0xC4><0x90>i<0xC4><0x91>eli and the Metallurgical Castle to form a group, inviting Ingrid G<0xC5><0xAB>tmani, Andri Kr<0xC5><0xAB>zi<0xC5><0x86>i<0xC5><0x9F> and J<0xC4><0x81>ni Grodumu to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has declined more than once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the very main thing - the desire to confirm that Latvian rock music is capable of living and living - remained unchanged.
"What is missing - ginseng, matani and bardani, these boys felt different from the stereotype of the generally accepted estrogen song," says music watcher Klass Vavere of the group.
In the group without the aforementioned musicians have worked such excellent musicians as Igo, Vilnius Russian, Modris Sterns, Valdis Starks, Laimis Ra<0xC4><0x9F>enai<0xC5><0x9F>, Talis Pusbarniks, Ainars Virga, Aivars B<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>z, Guntars Mu<0xC4><0x9F>enis, To<0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>s K<0xC4><0xB1>lenis, Dani<0xC5><0x9F>le<0xC4><0xB1>s
Entrance to the exhibition free of charge.
The exhibition will be held from August 19th to October 30th.
On August 27th, the concert hall of Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja "P<0xC5><0xAB>t, v<0xC4><0x9B>jni<0xC5><0x86>i" will be held for the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the group "Lvivi" "LIVIfest 2".

Zbigniew Stankevi<0xC4><0x8D>s: The time is coming, and the truth will ascend.
In an interview with the Independent, the Metropolitan Zbigniew Stankevi<0xC4><0x8D>, Archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia, stresses that if we want to gain strength in life, the Gospel message must be put at the center of it.
For the power of truth is greater than the power of evil.
Many are already on their way to the festivities of the reception of the Most Holy Virgin Mary in heaven in the Aglon.
What message will believers receive there this year?
In recent years, the Pope’s nuncio has expressed his desire to lead the main worship in Aglon.
Hence, the main content of the message is also in his interest.
It is also a tradition that the cross road is led by Bishop J<0xC4><0x81>nis Bullis.
He will also make his own message.
I was the leader of the church on the previous day.
Last year I addressed the encyclical "Laudato si" of Pope Francis and updated the common house, Earth theme in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course, I've been watching what's going on in the world, and I'm trying to react in my speech to it.
My approach is in line with the Church’s suggestion that the Gospel message should be placed at the center of life.
It should be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and inspires him to go further.
Then it talks to people.
But Caesar, in the discussion of the Lamp, you said that he "returns to the understanding of the full man."
What do you understand?
Does this mean that a person is avoiding the message of the church?
And does the church today have such a resource for return?
A man dies on a roadside in the Indian capital.
In the Indian capital, no one has licked or known about the man who was dying on the road - it turns out that he has been lying down on the road for an hour and then still beating, the BBC reports.
It is reported that the man, identified as Matibuls, traveled with a horse during the day, but worked for the guard at night.
Matthew 5:30 in the morning went home on the road when he was hit by a light car.
The surveillance camera record shows that the driver left the car to look at the victim, and then left.
After an hour, when no one was lying or knowing about the bleeding man, some garrison mocked him.
About 90 minutes after the incident, the police arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to the hospital, where he died of the injuries.
Referring to his candidacy for the position of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), Inga Koljegova, Head of the State Environmental Service, has saved the government from falling, says Professor Ojars Skudra, Associate Professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Koljegova’s explanation of the withdrawal of the nomination in connection with the conflicts in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she has prevented the collapse of the government.
Skudra said in a conversation with the agency LETA that it was difficult for him to imagine that next week at the government session "Unitedness" would support Koljegova's candidacy.
Therefore, if the Ministers of "Unity" voted against, but Koljegova so and so confirmed in office, it would lead to the government's resignation.
The expert also believes that before the announcement of the withdrawal of the candidacy, Koljegova has consulted both Finance Minister Danu Reiznieci-Ozol and Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ri Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski.
At the same time, it is also the adherence to the "United" which strongly opposed her candidacy.
When predicting whether to run a contest to find a suitable candidate, Skudra acknowledged that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be chosen or the institution as Director-General will continue to lead Dace Grey.
At the same time, he points out - if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that no other candidate is being considered, it is a good idea for Grey to not take part in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the head of the State Environment Service, Koljegova, has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director-General of the VID.
In the case of "unity" objections, the government postponed the approval of Koljegova in the post of Director-General of the VID for a week on Tuesday.
After the government’s decision to postpone the decision, Koljegova confirmed that he was still ready to become a VID driver.
However, in the presentation to Finance Minister Dan Reizniece-Ozola on Friday, she pointed out that she withdrew her consent to the transfer to the position of the head of the VID and that this was not an easy choice for her.
Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ra Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inska’s press secretary Andrej Vaivar explained to the LETA agency that a new competition will be held for the vacant post of Director General of the VID.
In the center of Riga there was an accident involving a police car.
In the center of Riga this afternoon there was a road accident involving the State Police car.
The police car with the sound and light signals turned on will rush to the top category call, until at the crossroads of Krishna Baron and Dzirnau Street, it crashes into another car.
The police explains the circumstances of the incident, but the initial information indicates that the second force did not miss the police car.
There was an accident involving a woman.
This year’s population has declined in Riga.
At the beginning of this year there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 inhabitants were officially registered in the capital, the agency LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Office (CSP).
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and major cities, where the population exceeds one million.
According to the data of the EU Statistical Office "Eurostat" Riga is the largest proportion of women - the capital of Latvia is convincingly ranked first among the largest cities in Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
The three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women in Europe’s largest cities: 123 in Vilnius and 121 in Tallinn for 100 men.
A warning pictogram shall be placed at the LNMM.
In the coming days, at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM) will be placed warning signs - pictograms, the representative of the Department of Property of Riga, Baiba Gailite, told the agency LETA.
Currently, the museum has successfully completed a quick repair of the glass damages that had arisen as a result of the operation of the sliders.
In the coming days, a warning pictogram will be placed next to it.
Its inhabitants will be informed that the cover tends to be slippery rains and snow, but it must not be moved by cars, as well as touring with bicycles, sledges and sledges.
On the said social network "Facebook" also wrote at the time, Ushakov, who stated that no security hazards are caused by the damage, but "looks inaccurate", and the sliders "will come to eat."
Holidays for children and parents- New children's playgrounds are set up in Riga.
This summer, the municipality of Riga has installed two new playgrounds in the city, <0xC4><0x8C>ipsala and <0xC4><0x8C>iekurkala, which are now available for children.
A wide, multifunctional toy vessel with various climbing elements, bridges, games, pipes and slides is installed on the beach of Chipsala.
The playground is for children of all ages.
There are also shovels and various balancing elements installed in the field.
The world of fantasy for small sailors enjoys the location of the attraction on the coast of Daugava with a view of the passenger harbour and the visible cruise ships there.
In turn, the playground between the 4th and 5th intersections of Chiekurkalna is equipped with a playground, a hammock, a stairway, a balance bridge, skulls, toy balls and other game elements, as well as a gym area with rings for strength and coordination exercises.
Under the field covered rubber cover in different colors.
To the playground on the side of the street is covered with a new, colorful bridle cover.
The reconstructed phase of the road was discovered in honey.
Transport Minister Uldis Augulis, the head of VAS Latvian National Roads (LVC), as well as the representatives of the builders of SIA "Binders" and municipalities today unveiled the main road of the reconstructed state of Russia (Grebnev). -Rezekne-Meduvpils-Lieb.
Roads are a national visit card, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed stage at the border with our southern neighbors.
This is another example of the fact that the co-financing of the European Union funds improves the situation on the main national highways.
"As the forecasts show, the resources available to roads during this planning period will be acquired already in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue to maintain the most loaded highways in very good quality, and also ensure the mobility of the population in all regions of Latvia," the slope of the roads is overgrown without the financial growth of the European Union.
The Minister of Transport also noted that the proposals prepared by traffic experts for sustainable financing of Latvian roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
Construction work in the stage from Medum to the Lithuanian border (156.4.-163.05. km) started at Binders SIA and this year they continued after a technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"In the reconstructed phase of the road, the construction of the road is completely restored and next year repairs will be started in the next stage from Medjugorje to Daugavpils itself, so all the way from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged," said the Chairman of the Board of the LVC.
The main national highways are the most crowded, and by 2018 we plan to ensure that all of the main national highways are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring periodic maintenance in a timely manner and to make an asphalt surface replacement every 7-9 years.
"This, of course, will require adequate funding, and all travellers will look forward to the proposals made by the expert group to arrange the road financing system," Lange said.
Within the project, road connections and lighting were arranged in the center of Medu.
Significant groundwork has been carried out: in four stages, large-scale restoration and extensive custom and upholstery works, a levelled longitudinal profile of the road, which has been very uneven so far.
Public transport stops have also been rebuilt and a newly constructed turnaround for public transport has been rebuilt.
Previously, there was insufficient disability on the road and the surrounding relief was not visible due to the mountain valleys, as well as the old road of the common relief.
In the next construction season, it is planned to restore the highway from the Daugavpils city border to the reconstructed phase (144,80-156,40 km).
This year, LVC plans to carry out various types of work more than 1100 kilometres of national road.
You can find information about all the repairs planned in the national highway network this year on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"In order to achieve the desired weight loss results, it is very important to choose the right combination of foods," acknowledges the Lithuanian dietitian Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easily enjoyable in the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A thoughtful combination of nutritional products can help not only reduce excess weight, but also aimfully promote various body processes.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination because they provide a lasting sense of satiety and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel dizzy.
Cayenne peppers and protein-rich foods, such as poultry meat or protein cocktails, not only create a sense of satiety, but also reduce the pots after large meals in the next meals.
This combination of foods can also increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies show that Cayenne peppers can help get rid of the fatty tissue in the abdominal area.
Eggs contain a metabolic-promoting nutrient - choline, while pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
By taking an adequate amount of this nutrient, cortisol levels can be reduced, hence also the accumulation of fat around the middle part of the body.
The oatmeal foam, which is added to fresh berries, has another tasty and fat-burning meal for breakfasts, which is worth including in your menu.
Oatmeal and berries contain fiber, which, according to Canadian scientists, controls grelin – the appetite-stimulating hormone – and thus also the feeling of hunger.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols that are helpful in weight loss and also prevent the formation of fat.
Vegetables and proteins also have the ability to perform miracles in weight loss.
Such a combination is able to create a sense of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, therefore promotes a sense of satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestive process and provide a sense of satiety for a longer time.
For lunch you can eat chicken with salads or prepare protein cocktails from the ready-made mixture and enjoy it together with your favorite vegetables.
What combinations of products to avoid.
Fruits contain sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the starch found in vegetables is polysaccharide.
Fruits are divided in the stomach mechanically, while they do not chemically divide until they reach the third or fourth stage of digestion, which takes place in the intestines.
Strength is divided into three different stages that start in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat a sweet meal immediately after a meal.
Eating a sweet meal immediately after a meal, it is "relaxed" in the stomach along with other foods, where it is not chemically digested and begins to bloat.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, nuts, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate-containing products along with lemons, lemons, oranges, grapefruit, pineapple or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptialin, which is found in the stems, only works in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids not only inhibit the decomposition of carbohydrates, but also promote their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and protein-rich combinations of milk and protein-like products at one meal.
It requires a variety of digestive juices, each of which has different strengths, characteristics and time to get to the stomach.
Lemon, honeymelon, muscatmelon and other melons should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons do not break down if they are found in the stomach together with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with starch, but the same cannot be said for fats and proteins - fats inhibit protein breakdown.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large amount of protein-containing products are consumed, avoid the use of fat altogether.
It also applies to freshening - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of nuts (containing protein) with whole avocado (containing fat).
Such a combination inhibits effective weight loss.
How to cook better?
"Eat cooking, thermal treatment causes significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original nutrient composition of the products," says the dietician.
In most cases, nutrients are lost by boiling foods in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases by cooking directly.
After cooking the remaining liquids of the vegetables, it is recommended to use for the preparation of the soup - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients left in the water, and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to prepare vegetables, even by steaming them.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of the lycopene in tomatoes.
When the tomatoes are cooked for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
Thermal treatment of eggs and meats removes the natural properties of the proteins in them, making them easier to digest.
Thermal treatment of meat and eggs also makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to absorb in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, although the freezing of fiber does not affect it.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase the intake of iron in the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-toxic iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy greenery, cereal products than blood-thinning iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and poultry.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-inflammatory iron in the body by taking dietary non-inflammatory iron products along with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-inflammatory iron so that our body can absorb it more easily.
Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen supply to the muscles and brains.
To get the maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fats, such as olive or lentil oil.
When cooking butter with salmon, add vitamin D to the rich salmon or sardines without added yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestines and plays an important role in the process of bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) together with sources of vitamin C such as strawberries, rye, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help to stabilize cholesterol levels, as well as to avoid arteries clogging.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized for Asian cartooning
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators claim that it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality in a completely absurd way every day and play with their identity.
You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or an image that would fit into the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
The lens is a cloudy, image distorting instrument that generates more than 30 million converted selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become public noticeable.
Snapchat lenses effects have already been criticized in the past when it comes to the fact that the app promotes too dark or light skin tones as an ideal benchmark of beauty.
This week, new lens effects were published, allowing users to form blemishes, blemishes and round eyes, and some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon – “yellow schemes”.
The question was also raised as to whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public denials erupted on Wednesday when The Verge and Motherboard editions reported that the lens effects were removed from the app.
The company explained that the objective of the lens is to portray anime images rather than caricaturizing people of Asian descent.
However, for people who have experienced racism, these effects resembled painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied similarity to Anime.
Korean-born American art students Grey Sparapani tweeted about the images gained a wide resonance. In an email she points out that the effects of the lens are "excessive and uncomfortable, not to mention more".
She adds that it is difficult to ignore the apparent similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This suggests that the effect of the lens is not simply a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has entered into these cultural foundations.
American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, ranging from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use in our daily lives.
And Snapchat’s large youth audience, representing different races, unlike older populations, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "today such things do not go unnoticed ", said 25-year-old Keith Zhou in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, the product manager of the company "Medium" <0xC5><0xBD>ou deleted his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article "Medium" and telephone interview, she explained that she said that race problems arise due to Snapchat's employment policy, which does not support racial diversity enough.
Zhou criticized the management of the company, consisting mainly of white men, and then concluded his article with a reference to <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so these decisions are allowed. Whether representatives of some other races work in the company, but they do not take the position to be able to express their views safely and comfortably," said Zhou, an American of Chinese descent.
She also agrees with others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not reveal how many employees represent different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but its representative revealed that the company has hired staff specialists who will focus on ensuring that the company also represents racial minorities who are not widely represented and will promote inclusion.
Zhou, on the other hand, will not renew his Snapchat account, adding: "Interestingly, do they really need more users like us to understand that it's not right."
The House of Congress announces that military officials have corrupted reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement released on Thursday, the House of Representatives noted that representatives of the U.S. Central Command have corrupted the reports, describing the war on Islamic State in Iraq and Syria far more optimistic than it really is.
The analysts of the Central Intelligence Service express general dissatisfaction with the temporary report of the task force set up by representatives of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Financing Subcommittee of the Republicans, stating that the management of the Armed Forces is under the control of the Whales.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, supervising U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report reports that intelligence reports, confirmed by senior Centcom leaders, reflect the U.S. fight against terrorism more positively than it really is. The facts were regularly distorted, reflecting better achievements, rather than successful.
A California Republican spokesman, Ken Calvert, said: “Centcom’s actions are unacceptable – our soldiers are the ones who suffer when our policy makers receive false messages.”
Centcom management errors in the top management of the organization to be searched.
This 10-page report detailes the existing problems in the Central Command’s reflection and analysis of U.S. efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration have attempted to distort reports, it shows that the Centcom leadership has put some pressure on analysts to portray ISIS as more optimistic about the Islamic State (also known as ISIS).
The report notes that in the first half of 2015, the press releases, announcements and reports of the Central Administration presented the situation to Congress in a significantly more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom representatives publicly announced that the Mosula recovery operation could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq’s second-largest city still under Islamic State control.
Kansas Republican Party representative Mike Pompeo wrote in his report: "The investigation of several months clearly confirms this."
Between the middle of 2014 and the middle of 2015, U.S. central administration officials disrupted the reports, depicting ISIS threats in Iraq weaker than they actually were.
The Republican Party set up a working group, knowing that analysts were concerned that information about the Islamic State was being corrupted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence conducts an investigation of the activities of the Centcom Intelligence Service.
On Thursday, members of the Intelligence Management Committee of the Democratic Party published their own report, in which they agree with some of the Republican working group's conclusions.
In his report, Democrat Adams B. Shifs said that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom had too limited the preparation of intelligence assessment reports on ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Shifa explains that this process "helped the dissemination of information", deteriorated the work ethic of analysts and "spread facts that are not true."
But Shif and Democrats added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to develop reports according to a "predetermined or political position".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congress investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon General Inspectorate had initiated an investigation into the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said the Pentagon will not comment on the congressional report as long as the investigation continues.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Ministry of Defence and Intelligence calls for constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria has been successful (a statement made by an increasing number of representatives from the Ministry of Defence).
But last year’s accusations raise doubts as to whether President Obama can fully rely on the Central Administration’s reports of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of events more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hughes published a study claiming that George W. Bush’s administration started a war in Afghanistan, thinking too little about its possible threats.
Hughes also played an important role in revealing the issue of Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, official representatives reported that the Hugher team found that, contrary to public reports, airstrikes to the Islamic State oil plants did not significantly deteriorate the financial situation of the terrorist group, because they would have been over-built, built and built.
The Times reported in the September issue that this discovery did not come outside the Central Governance walls.
At the time, the Commander-General of the Centcom, Lois Ostins III, was critically criticized because many lawmakers felt that the war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin took his leave and General Joseph L. Votel took his place.
The U.S. wins in a duel with the UK women's field hockey, making it the fourth consecutive win.
The day after the victory over Japan with a score of 6:1, Keith Bama scored the first two goals in favor of the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday, when the Americans won the Indian team with a score of 3:0.
The five goal advantages in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said that you can’t remember if something like this ever worked for her.
She said, "I don't have any feelings."
I'm not one of those people who read the gates they got.
But she knows that the Americans' score in the Olympics is 4-0, which gives them in their group an inseparable with Britain, which on Thursday after winning over Japan with a score of 2-0 remained unbeaten.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday to play their last matches in the first round of games.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the group of six teams and which second.
The winner of the first place will avoid a little longer from meeting the strong Dutch squad, who is the leader of the second group.
While the game did not open on Saturday, the Americans have already sparked a surprise storm four years ago, taking the last place among the 12 teams in London.
This team also featured Bama.
She grew up in Blubel, a field hockey stick took her hands for the first time at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters had already worked on this type of sport in Drexel) and joined the national selection when she was 16 years old, becoming a young player in the selection.
She didn’t go to the 2008 Olympics because she didn’t get to the final.
However, 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
The following year, the Englishman Craig Parhams was appointed as the coach of the selection and everything changed to the right.
Bama called it "culture, mentality, and physical change."
We did not invest as much in London as we do now.
We've completely changed everything.
On Thursday, Bama unveiled the result of winning goals in the first half with a rear shot from a close distance.
India started the game without a win in their account, but their selection was very harsh and kept a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama regained the goal.
She put the balls in the opponents' zone on the left side of the field, then noticed to be in the middle of the field and to throw the balls in the opponents' gates, taking the Americans 2-0 in the lead.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melisa Gonzales won another goal.
This was the first U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs dry game, in each of the first three games coming through one gate.
She's got a crush.
And so did Bama.
"We are doing very well right now," Pahams said, but just how well, the game will show on Saturday.
The most depressing food in the period of depression is "Satisfactory meal"
In March 1933, shortly after the election of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the oval room to hold a meal.
President Ruzvelt tasted fine culinary delicacies such as a dill liver paste or a bacon and a Merilenda turkey soup.
But on that day his meal was much more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato pepper and dessert - plum pudding.
Jennifer Steinman says: “This is a way of solidarizing in cooking with people who have suffered very badly.”
Her husband Andrew Kou adds: "It's also a message to Americans as they should eat."
A couple from Brooklyn Heights district are culinary historians.
Kou's last book, "Food of Vegetables," describes the Chinese cuisine in America, but Ziegelman in his book, "97 Abels", describes the life through a meal rental house in Manhattan's eastern lower part.
Their new joint work, "Saturated Meal," which will be published by the publisher Harper on Tuesday, is the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in the culinary, they held a meal together with the reporter "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple luncheon located in the Flatiron district and operating since the start of the Great Depression in 1929.
Mrs. Ziegelman, 54, ordered butter with melted cheese and sliced olives, while 57-year-old Kou ordered carrots, potato beans and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered a fake hat, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate for the conversation about the Great Depression meal.
Mrs. Ziegelman said that the fake fox was very popular.
There was peanut butter, liver butter and peanut butter.
They were made from the basic ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the meals.
Imagine what it is like to eat so many peanuts that they have lunch instead.
Mr. Kou relocated.
"Of course, it seemed that the stomach was full of lead," he added.
In the pre-depression years, the American lunch table resembled the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were preparing food for their men-workers and freshly prepared sapphire was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During World War I, it was the Americans who sent food to the Europeans. The "sweet meal" described how the Americans adapted to the conditions when America suddenly was no longer an abundance of land.
"At the time, food became the main focus of the American people in everyday life," says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about this topic.
In fact, the new budget diets became significant: such unknown foods as fake stews and stews became everyday, stews were "a great way to use excesses," noted Ms. Ziegelmanas, because the cooks could hide unattractive ingredients.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaply dried fruits.
Meat, which for years was the main ingredient in American food, has now become an extremely rare luxury item.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of the food were more important than the taste, the sex of new, unprecedented forms.
In an old cookbook, Ms. Ziegelman found a recipe for making onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr. Kou adds: "It was not a popular lunch table supplement."
Mrs. Ziegelman stresses, "It was a mystery."
Peanut butter and roasted onions are not compatible.
Many recipes for homemade dishes applied to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of Household Economics from 1923 to 1943, set state eating habits that were not customary either before or after the Great Depression.
When publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised households to become "economists" and take on such challenges as turning pasta and potato blends into a tasty meal.
"Sweet Meal" is a sweet of historical delights.
Particularly interesting is the evidence of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as the attitude of President Herbert Hughes to "let me eat cake".
Although he publicly told about his simplicity of childhood and eating in Iowa, he actually ate as a fine millionaire he had become.
Mr. Kou says: "He liked European cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in the almost golden living room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely distracted from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book says that Ruizvelt hired a waitress who did not train to cook, so the White House became a place "where not only one of the most flavorful dishes in Washington, D.C., but also the worst cooked dishes were served."
As soon as the country's economy recovers, most of the depression era's culinary signatures disappear.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutrition, as well as on how to use science in cooking, added Ms. Ziegelman.
The couple says that when writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as why she was unable to throw food out.
"She was really afraid to throw food out," said Mr Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "She was actually tracing people."
There was once an incident with wind cakes.
When we had dinner at Eisenberg's dining room, a couple of writers pulled out of a bag of home-made desserts: a pulp pulp that President Ruizvelt used to eat at lunch.
"It's a plum foaming," said Ms. Steinman, adding that at the time there was a common habit of giving modest dishes a chic name.
It does not contain powder, only dried plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All were impatiently saturated with the brown mass of carotes found on the dishes.
Surprisingly, it wasn’t so bad.
Mr. Kou ate some more cucumbers.
Hearing of an experienced "economist", he said to his wife: "A slice of sliced walnuts will be crushed."
Gilead to be reimbursed for legal expenses in the fight against Merck for the Hepatitis C patent
The District Judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimburse the costs of legal services it has paid for in the case of patenting Hepatitis C against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was fined <0xC2><0xA3>200 million in a case for the breach of two Merck patents, which threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when a U.S. federal judge found violations in the Brand’s activity, such as not lying after being arrested.
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bets Labson Friman said Gilead had the right to claim compensation for legal expenses incurred by it to defend itself in this case.
Merck is trying to take positions in the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with the next-generation Hepatitis C drug, which is effective in 90% of cases of liver disease.
The case was initiated in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead medicine.
The US-backed forces claim that they have completely taken control of the city of Manbij from the Islamic State.
US-backed forces have taken full control of Manbij city in the northern part of the state near the Turkish border and the last Islamic State soldiers have abandoned the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently clearing the city of the last enemy fighters who have not yet abandoned the city.
They have released more than 2,000 hostages-civilians captured by the militants, Sharfan Darvi<0xC5><0xA1>s of the SDS-associated Manbij military council told Reuters.
"At the moment, the city is in full control of us and we are looking for fighters," he told Reuters.
In 2015, Clinton’s income reached <0x24>10.75 million and the pair paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
Hilary Clinton published a 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned <0x24>10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent, respectively.
During 2015, the Clintons donated <0x24>1 million, mainly to their Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton earned about <0x24>5.3 million, acting as a sniper and former secretary of state with a public bond of <0x24>3 million in his work in the Wall Street Journal.
Clinton's election partner, U.S. Virginia State Senator Tim Caine and his wife Anna Holtone have released their tax returns for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hilary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to set new standards for financial transparency," Clinton campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind a variety of inventions and reserves so as not to fulfill promises to reveal his tax information.
Publication of tax information is a registered practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have audited the State Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your Walk," in his Twitter post, told Clinton's campaign partner Ians Sams about the tax information of Democratic candidates.
On Thursday, Trump's special adviser, Michael Kohens, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose tax information until the audits are completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican Party presidential candidate Mits Romney and other Republicans, argue that his resignation raises questions about his real estate amounts, donations and other business obligations, including in connection with the crisis.
Clinton fired an oil fire by publishing a video on Friday in which several influential Republicans demanded that Trump release his tax information.
She returned to this issue during an economic talk on Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
The Politico reports that during the 1990s, Trump paid very little or no taxes at all, and on Friday, the New York Times columnist reported that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of billionaire Varenna Buffett’s proposal, promotes the idea that anyone who earns more than <0x24>1 million a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
During Clinton’s speech last week in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is also located, Buffett called on Trump to exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he was also audited by the Revenue Service and Trump was afraid of voters, not the tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information until 2007.
The Clintons now live in Chappak, New York and have paid the average federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 and the total tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton tax report shows that unlike most Americans, only <0x24>100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clintons received <0x24>109,000 in dividends.

Jewish filmmaker criticizes hotel in Berlin for unlocking Israeli telecommunications code at the request of an Arab - RT News
A French-born Jewish filmmaker sparked a storm on social media when he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol hotel had no Israeli alarm code available in Berlin. The hotel staff base this on the demands of Arab customers.
Claude Lancman, the director of the Holocaust Shoah documentary, did not hide his dissatisfaction with Berlin’s Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent stay, Lancmans tried to find the Israeli telephone number in the list of hotels on offer.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel was captured and destroyed?
Written by Lancman.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers to call this country through its call center.
The director asked the hotel’s staff for an explanation.
Lancman writes that the answer received was "they were shocked."
The hotel administrator explained that "it was a deliberate decision of the hotel management."
The reason for the removal of the code made the filmmaker even more angry.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they requested the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancmans quoted a hotel employee as saying.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jakov Hadas-Handelsman, has called the case a "great scandal".
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
The same thing is a big shame for yourself.
And the fact that it happened in Germany, right in this hotel network is an even greater humiliation.
Explanations are not required.
The official said: "We hope that the hotel will make the right conclusions."
This event also gained a fairly wide resonance on the internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel has simply been issued to Arabic customers.
Another record said to be "canyon", indicating that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
The issue Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself quickly rejected all the disturbances, stating that it was all a "misunderstanding" and apologised to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the national number list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted Kempinski as saying.
And add that the code has been added to the list again.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against Brazilian students protesting.
Students and police clashes took place on Thursday in the Brazilian city of São Paulo, where students gathered in a demonstration against reforms of the government’s education system.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
Problems began when law enforcement tried to sneak out students, as a result of the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to show their distrust with the reforms of the education system.
The proposal of Governor Geraldo Alckmina of São Paulo is to close almost 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be relocated to other schools with a view to saving funds.
Some protesters painted graffiti on the walls with messages against interim President Michael Temer.
This protest took place just days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations to express their support for the deposed President Dilma Rousseff, for whom the Senate voted in favor.
Scottish Kelums Skinners finishes first, bringing the UK gold medal in cycling
Kelums Skiners of Scotland finished the first men's cycling team sprint race at the Rio Bike Stadium last night. The UK team defended its championship title, which it won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in these races, making the proud legendary Scotsman Seru Kris Hou and leading the winners to New Zealand.
Four years ago, Great Britain won a surprising victory when Hoye won the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championships in London, although Hoye had already finished his athlete career.
The problems were in the stage between the Beijing and London Olympics, as experienced startup specialist Jamie Staff had to be replaced.
They did it at the last minute.
When Hayes left, he tried to fill his place with Kian Emmadi and Matt Krampton.
The British coaches put hope in Skinner, seeing in him the potential, which he later also proved.
Indians, Kenya - champions who started four years ago with Hoe and Skinners, who set the Olympic qualification record, but a better start to the race was for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Indians in their circle were in close propulsion, Kenyans rose to leadership, and Skinners defended that leadership.
The change of strategy played an important role in the victory as the Indians drove with a larger gearbox to allow Kenya and especially Skinner to drive faster.
Howe watched the race as a representative of the BBC and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenia and Hindes as they climbed on the pedestal of honor.
The 23-year-old glass whistleblower said, "It was an inexpressible tribute."
I will do everything I can to defend my name.
In the end, we set the Olympic record and won the World Championships.
It was simply unbelievable.
There is no better victory.
After winning the 2012 London Olympics with Kenya and Hoe, the Indians admitted that they had deliberately fallen on the track after their unsuccessful start.
Later, he rejected these comments and it was not possible for British competitors to prove otherwise.
There were no such incidents this time.
The Hindus said: "The flags of the United Kingdom in the tribunes recalled London in memory."
In the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so winning the Olympics was really special.
One medal will compete for the country that won seven out of ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of the team’s progress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given Kenya’s result, he could indeed repeat Hoja’s success by earning three Olympic gold medals.
In addition, Kenya was born on March 23 (it seems to be a British holy date, as on this day Steve Regreeves, Mo Farahs and Roger Banisters were also born).
On this date, Hayes was also born.
Kenya’s next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "I just enjoy it right now.
The team's journey is always the best.
Because then you can win with the team members.
To be honest, winning one is a bit lonely."
The Hindus said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be named in the Armored Round."
It was the only battle for medals that day, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Ser Bradley Vigin, Ed Klensey, Steve Burkes and Owen Douls showed the fastest qualifying time in the four-kilometre race to the four.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record, set in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will definitely be at the center of attention.
Yesterday, before the qualifying trip, he had a disagreement with the Commissioner when the judges called him to measure his growth.
On the women's journey that will continue and close today, Laura Trota, Joanna Roosevelt Shanda, Elinora Barker and Keith Archibald from Milngavia set a new record time of 4:13,260.
The UK delegation expects the British cycling team to win medals in the middle of the Olympics.
With excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone is looking forward to the same achievements in Rio.
In the meantime, there have been various backslidings, following allegations of sexism and insulting honor, technical director Shayne Saton has resigned, and the careers of Hayes and Victoria Bendletton also end.
However, with the start of the first velodrome races, it is expected that the UK will always reach its highest level in the right time.
The future of the Portland melting pot becomes unclear because an ambitious contract has been terminated.
The future of the aluminum mill and its hundreds of employees in Portland, Victoria has become unclear as its main customers the energy company has announced the termination of cooperation.
This communication is based on the Victorian Government’s plans to stop subsidizing the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year subsidies will be discontinued in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at the Alcoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the melthouse consumes about 10 percent of all Victoria's electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting pot, which led to the discontinuation of the Anglesea power station.
Alcohol Portland melting pot works with losses and can be closed.
These events were caused by years of speculation about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of factory production.
The factory energy supplier "AGL", which supplies energy from its "Loy Yang A" power station in Latroube, says that the other three owners are also likely to terminate their contracts.
Most of the power plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, and parts of the company are also owned by the holding companies of China’s CITIC and Japan’s Marubeni Corp.
AGL is looking forward to the continued operation of the Portland plant, which would mean a further power supply plant," said its representative.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called "risk-limiting contracts", which are intended to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a period of validity of 12 months, so they will be in force until 2017.
AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in fiscal year 2017," said a representative of the company.
As of fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profits will be limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale prices of electricity.
AGL claims that it has already calculated losses of <0x24>187 million in its forecasts, foreseen that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa reports that the decision to terminate contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue the operation of the melting pot or to supply energy to it.
The U.S. company reported that in 2010 it signed a contract with "Loy Yang" for 20 years, but it will be discontinued in November. The company does not provide explanations for why it will discontinue cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concerns about both the possible closure of the Portland melting pot in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy of the sector.
AGL CEO Steven Mikelson said last week that according to analysts estimates, Portland uses 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy per year.
If both of these factories were to be removed from the energy market, energy demand would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people each year.
More than 160 000 claims are rejected each year, and the reduction in the budget could make the situation worse.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal exploitation - are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overloaded, warns that the reduction in funding will only make the situation worse.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than so far.
The director of the Queensland Legal Center, James Farels, said that the latest report of the National Law Centers Association reports that legal aid is currently being denied to thousands of people who need it.
Mr Farels pointed out that if this decision is not revoked, the situation will only get worse.
He also says: "The Queensland Legal Center is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that the aid is denied to thousands of people who need it."
People who are trying to end violent relationships, people with deep debts, families who are experiencing divorce, workers who are unfairly fired - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this report shows that they do not care.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 percent, which means that thousands of other residents of Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately suspend the reduction of funding so that people in need of legal assistance can get it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to raise the level of legal assistance to the national average.
Now is the time to also pay attention to the needs of the local community and their customers and to invest in this important area for the Palazzouk government.
Donald Trump’s campaign is sued in court because one of his employees pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign organizers have been sued for failing to act on the information that its North Carolina Operations Chief will aim a gun at an employee when they drove in a car in February.
This incident was described in a court order filed by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer, in Charlotte's court on Wednesday.
Bordini said he had waited for months for an internal examination of the matter to begin, but realized that it would not happen.
Leader Earl Philips "draws the pistol, put his right index finger on the sky, and turned the stick against Vincent's ankle," Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that by filing a complaint to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people have experienced the same.
"Weapons do not have to be challenged to cause losses," Bordini wrote in his complaint.
Just two days before the submission of this case, the Republican candidate for president caused a scandal, informing people that "People of the Second Amendment", i.e., gun owners and enthusiasts, could act in the event that she would win the election and her daughter Klinton's race.
Trump’s campaign representatives said the media had ripped his words out of context, and he had never incited anyone to violence.
Bordini with his claim wants to seek compensation from the campaign organizers for negligent surveillance, but from Philips - for assault, illegal use of weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
Trump spokesman Houp Hick did not immediately comment.
I couldn't get in touch with Philip.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip has recently launched a campaign.
Also, he has not managed to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consulting Services".
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has carried out a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition - the holidays of luggage and sports in Ku<0xC5><0x9F>adas<0xC4><0xB1>.
On Saturday, for the first time, the people gathered for the holidays and sports.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided this time that the feast of Ezra would be no more.
The new page is now overlooked.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the race was not in the traditional ways and too serious to take, because, for example, the shooters had to throw to the sleeping target, the shoe flew, with a human left-handed sword, "bumping" was not at all in any Olympics.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, skillful and confident he is.
After the sports games, everyone gathered in the outdoor estuary, where the holidays began.
During this time, there were also "children's corners", where the little ones could get out of the inflatable attractions and get a new picture of the hat in the makeup shop.
The news, which could also become a tradition, was a demonstration of drivers, where both tractors and motorcycles went.
All spoke to the Head of the Board of Directors, Inga Kadike-Skadi<0xC5><0x86>a, who wanted a nice rest and dry weather, but still rained, but it was not able to interfere with much.
The holidays continued with the greetings of the youngest residents of K<0xC5><0xAB>l<0xC4><0xAB>cim.
It is really good that the paycheck has been supplemented with five girls and one boy.
With performances to the fans had arrived amateur art collectives from Engures province - viewers very liked the performances of the senior dance group "Rudens rhythms", the performers of various folk dances "Reds" and the young dancers "Golden Pearls".
And it’s not that there was a slip on the slope of the stage, either.
Of course, the local people and villages were delighted by the famous actor duo J<0xC4><0x81>nis Jarans and Dainis Porgants, who were again Mildi<0xC5><0x86>a Nabi<0xC5><0x86>a and Sk<0xC4><0x9B>ir<0xC4><0xAB>te Kr<0xC4><0x81>nin<0xC4><0x97>s, as well as the attractive wives of Berzziema from the fisherman's seed "Dieni<0xC5><0x86>as".
Balli was played by the group "Bruges".
The United Kingdom must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Hitrov.
Hitrov will not only promote prosperity and growth in the local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Hitrow very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we invested a lot of work so that all the regions of the country could benefit from the Olympics.
Stratford and <0xC3><0x85>stenda have won an enormous amount of Olympics.
And we will do this once again, providing locals and businesses with business opportunities near Hetrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and finally add a point to youth unemployment in the Hitrov area.
As at the 2012 London Olympics, there will also be people this time who will consider this challenge to be too big and that the enlargement of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics and that it would be a global outbreak.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012, and even in the case of Hetrow, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hitrov has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Hitrov is an infrastructure project, benefiting the whole society, not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion, creating ground for both employment and experience in this airport and throughout the UK.
A great team is working in Heathrow, which has created an infrastructure investment program worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion, including in the timeframe and budget starting with Terminal 5, which five years from the site has been named as the best airport terminal in the world.
Now they are ready to build a third runway, which will be financed by private investments of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure that the expansion of Heathrow will be the same.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, providing the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain could be proud of.

In Switzerland, a woman climbs the highway, trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he fell on the highway.
The police were trying to find witnesses for the accident when several cars crossed her on the highway early on Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morges in Vo Canton.
A cantonal police report says that, desperately seeking to commit suicide, the woman had been stranded on the road in the dark, where she was picked up by several cars.
Unsurprisingly trying to kill himself, the victims, a 49-year-old Swiss, collected a number of machines, including a heavy machine.
She died at the scene.
A number of drivers involved in the accident have already testified, while other drivers have not yet been clarified, the police say, calling on the drivers involved and the witnesses of the accident to withdraw.
A criminal investigation has also been initiated, which in this case is a logical step, told Le Tribune de Geneve by lawyer Gilles Hofsteller.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Is it possible to avoid collision?
Hofstellers adds, "To noskaidros prosecutors."
Two similar cases, which have occurred over the last 5 years, show that none of the drivers will be held responsible.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone to the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that the drivers could not predict that the pedestrian would be on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was convicted of negligence when in August 2014 she was taken by a man who was lying in the middle of the night on A1 road near Paixen.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim was drunk and later found himself asleep on the road.
The Court concluded that the policeman who was on his way to the scene of the accident drove in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge acknowledged that the sleeping man on the road was "a completely unpredictable and exceptional case".
Anyone who has information about the incident on Thursday near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Online collects signatures for a new VID manager position for the contest.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" began collecting signatures for the holding of a new post of Head of State Revenue Service (VID).
The petition addressed to the Ministers of the National Union (NA) and the Greens and Farmers Union (ZZS) stated that the public wants a transparent and professional appointment process.
The petition was created on August 10th and is currently signed by 55 people.
The process of appointing Ingas Koljegova, a candidate for the post of VID Director-General, is opaque and unprofessional.
It recalls the best official traditions of the Soviet Union.
This discredits public administration and once again makes the public trust in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates should be assessed," the petition said.
Its author J<0xC4><0x81>nis B. pointed out that the public does not know the criteria as Koljegova was chosen for the position.
It is also not clear what the candidate’s job prospects for the VID are.
The petition states that the State Chancellor must create a new, open competition in which professional candidates are actively addressed, staffing specialists are recruited and appropriate remuneration is offered.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola officially appointed Koljegov as the head of the VID last week, this week the government was scheduled to approve him in the new position, but all the ministers of the party "Unitedness" voted against, so the question of the week was postponed.
If we lose, then we played badly.
Aleksandrs Samoilovs and J<0xC4><0x81>nis <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x9B>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> awaited the award at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, however, without reaching it, there is no difference where to close the competition, after leaving the tournament, said Samoilovs.
One of the world’s strongest beach volleyball pairs on Thursday in the final and decisive game of the subgroup tournament by 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost to Brazilian Evandra González Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgadu in the first round of the sport, in the final round.
In three sub-group matches Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same relationship was for two more pairs.
In the following, the ratio of three pairs of small points to each other was counted, which was the most disadvantaged after the convincing loss in this game was directly for the Latvian duo.
You will also be able to use your personal data in order to ensure that you have access to your personal data and that you are not able to access it.
I don't even know how the rest of the set left without points.
It is not allowed to play.
After that, everything was fine in the second set and at the end of the set was able to break the game, and it should have been a good foundation for the third set as well.
We started it similarly, but after we switched sides, the result increases for only one team.
We made too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup all teams were similar, almost all matches had three sets, so small points were important.
"We had to play more similarly, rather than giving 3-4 points in a row," said the athlete.
We knew Evandra could be served.
“In the first set we met with it, in the second innings 1-2 points, but in the third at <0x2B>4 he already left the game,” <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x9B>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> recalled.
We tried to show you the best game.
There are moments, no moments.
The overall assessment situation was not seen before the match, but it was known that it needed as many small points as possible.
"If we lost, then I played badly," Samoilov said.
We expected good service from Evander and with it the first sets were also quite good at the ends, but in the third he opened service and it was difficult to form an attack.
In contrast, I made a lot of mistakes in taking in directly to the Pedrus service, but it had to be done.
Samoilov said that unlike the previous game, athletes today did not have nervousness.
"We went, we played, there was also protection, but we needed better service reception," said the athlete.
"They played well and finally got to the 'urna'."
We have already said before the tournament that the outing is the most uncomfortable what could have been.
We also had a chance to fight for the first place, but we didn’t even get out of the group.
"We all expected a medal, and we also expect from ourselves, but then there is no difference - 25th or 4th place," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo would continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is only one tournament.
Samoilov Riodezaneiro had already had his third Olympic career, as he started in Beijing in 2008 with Martini P<0xC5><0x82>avin, but four years ago he played in London with Ruslan Sorokin.
In the meantime, this was the second start in the Olympics for <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x9B>di<0xC5><0x86>as.
"Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company "Latvenergo" is following the process of opening the gas market both from the position of a consumer and a potential trader, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether in the future Latvenergo will also join the gas market as a trader will determine what model of the gas market and legal framework will be established."
"For this reason, we are actively involved in drafting and commenting legislation, as well as submitting our proposals," Bidere said.
The agency BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economics (EM) in cooperation with the Public Services Regulatory Commission and the energy company "Latvija Gase" has developed a draft of regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers "Providing the rules of natural gas trade and use in the natural gas industry" that will change the principles of the natural gas market in 2017.
When working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the process of natural gas trading as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution, the "trader-centric model" was chosen, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one invoice system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the field of electricity trade.
We remind you that the gradual opening of the market for household users - even after April 3, 2017, those household users who will not want to choose another natural gas dealer, will be able to continue to use natural gas from the existing dealer at a regulated price.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader," the ministry said.
Traders, on the other hand, will have to choose a natural gas trader with which to enter into a natural gas trade agreement.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement, the existing natural gas trader will provide for the trade of natural gas for a certain period of time.
The draft rules of the Cabinet of Ministers detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules set out the procedure in which natural gas is supplied to users in order to supply natural gas and discontinue its supply, in order to ensure the safe use of natural gas systems, in order to provide the supplier, the public supplier, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gaseous object in order to supply, supply and use of natural gas.

Minister: next week it is planned to decide on an increase in the remuneration of the Director-General of the VID.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers’ Union (ZZS)) plans next week with Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ri Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski (ZZS) and government coalition partners to talk about the remuneration of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
Reizniece-Ozola told reporters on Friday that the question of increasing the remuneration of the Director-General of VID should be addressed urgently in order to make this position more attractive to potential candidates for a repeated call.
We are also talking about the change in the terms of the competition next week.
The Minister also stressed that she did not think of any specific candidate to be called for vacancy.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the view that the head of the National Environment Service, Inga Koljegova, would have been a good VID Director-General.
On the other hand, with regard to the current head of the VID, Daci Greyko, who expressed his willingness to take up the post, the Minister reiterated the view that the new VID Director-General should be "on the edge" and should not come from the VID body.

BNS has already announced that the head of the State Environment Service, Inga Koljegova, has submitted an application to the Minister of Finance Danai Reizniece-Ozolai (ZZS), in which he withdraws his candidacy for the post of Director General of VID.
In her submission, she said that it was not an easy choice, but that during the last two weeks, her relatives have experienced serious emotional pressure, even though they have not committed any criminal acts.
Koljegova also pointed out that the discussion of her candidacy has led to controversy between the ruling coalition parties, which is also unacceptable.
It is also reported that former Director-General of VID, Inára Petersson, left office at the end of June.

Oil prices in the world continue to rise on Friday morning, with a positive impact on investors’ moods on Saudi Arabia’s oil minister’s statements, which reinforces expectations that the largest oil-producing countries will be held at the OPEC global meeting in September.
The three main U.S. stock indexes reached a record high on Thursday, which has not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several major companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday were also a reason for the rise in European stock indexes.
The value of the US dollar rose on Thursday against the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen.

The turnover of the producer of canned "Blue Lagoon" will drop by 33.8%.
The turnover of the canned producer "Blue Lagoon" was EUR 4,202 million, which is 33.8% less than a year ago, while the losses of the company decreased by 5.7 times - up to 904.7 thousand euros.
The company’s management report states that in 2015 the company was working on the losses that resulted from a number of reasons, including in connection with the permanent lack of means of circulation, caused by the possibility of a "Unicredit Bank" contract to be withdrawn from the Baltic market.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient resources to buy cheaper raw materials in large quantities and receive a discount on the amount.
The withdrawal of the relevant bank from the Latvian market also prompted the company to implement Structural Funds support projects that would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and upgrade its infrastructure.
Similarly, the company’s financial creators were negatively affected in the past year by the rise in raw material prices and the reluctance of customers to pay more than the goods produced by the company.
“Only in the second half of July 2016, customers recognized price changes and were ready to buy goods at new – highest – prices,” said the company’s management.
Also in 2015, "Blue Lagoon" began negotiations with potential investors, including the valuation of the company's movable and immovable assets.
Investors have already been to the company’s largest creditor, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have met and negotiated possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s operations and development were positively affected by the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan entailed improvement and optimization of technological processes, allowing for greater production productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment were purchased, which ensures a higher production speed," said the company's management.
The management of "Blue Lagoon" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's production to fulfill orders that were not possible until now.
The first batch of production, which will be produced on this equipment, will be ready in August.
Since the protocols of intent for the sale of the product have already been signed, all the products produced will be sold in accordance with the protocols of intent.
The new product will increase turnover by around 300,000 euros per month,” said the company’s management.
Also, in August 2016, the company plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq.
In 2016, Blue Lagoon shipped the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the drainage market to Cyprus and will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the United States in September this year.
As a result of all the aforementioned measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, Blue Lagoon worked with a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,347 million and a loss of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,113 million.
Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and has a capital of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.156 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals - Mihailam Kaidanova (89.11%) and Igoram <0xC5><0xA0>ir<0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>on (10.89%).
Welcome to the museum at 15 p.m. to welcome the film show Zaru Leanderi and participate in the press conference.
Riga can be seen as the city of the beginning and inspiration of Sarah Leander’s career of the theatrical cinema.
The village of Zara Lendera near the mother-in-law Ruta, who was the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, was a fateful one in Riga in 1924, because it was she who discovered an unusual low contract for Zara Lendera’s wife, which she tried to debut at the Riga Kabara Tea Room.
Perhaps it was the accidental sensitivity in Riga that became the fateful turning point in Zara’s creative path towards world fame.
R<0xC4><0xAB>ga Z<0xC4><0x81>rai Leander was associated with warm memories, and she hoped to return to Riga in guest shows, but unfortunately these hopes were not intended to be fulfilled, as World War II began.
Using the form of the show, this meeting will be possible at the Riga Festival 2016 and the outstanding role of Zara Leander will be felt by the great Ieva Kerevica.

The insurer will pay compensation on Wednesday to cancelled air passengers at the airport.
If Insurance paid a travel insurance fee to a family for Wednesday, August 10th cancelled the flight at the airport "R<0xC4><0xAB>ga", which caused the cancellation of the intended visit to the music festival.

Due to the repair of the neighbor, the man is at a tight ceiling and forced to leave the house.
In the LTV program "Study 4", Dmitry Saidja<0xC5><0xA1>ev, whose neighbor started the repair of capital in his apartment, and since then Dmitry has been worried about the ceiling and there is no certainty that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors did an arbitrary construction and the ceilings were damaged in my apartment.
Then I informed the Riga municipality, house managers and other organizations.
The building council said that we are not an operational service and we do not have any experts.
“The owner of the apartment has to go to the Latvian Engineer’s Union, and there will be an expert from there,” says Dmitry.
The inviting expert arrived, fixed what had happened and admitted that the overlay was in an unsatisfactory state.
However, it has been a month since Dmitry's first submission to the building, and by the beginning of this week no one has been able to answer whether being in the apartment is not life-threatening.
In the building council said - such is the legislation, wait if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
"Then I wrote to the Riga House, but they sent the house manager, then the house manager again to the building, and then there's a roadside," says Dmitry.
After looking at all the paper stacks, it is clear that the construction works have been stopped, although at any time you can hear someone working there.
Within two months, the expert must be carried out and within six months, the owner of the apartment who performs repairs, all these defects must be eliminated.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the construction board considers it to be incomplete and superficial.
The expert did not specify whether the metal grid present in this supportive structure was affected, so there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment is at risk.
"That's why we have asked this expert for additional clarification," says Ilze <0xC5><0xA0><0xC5><0xAB>ka, representative of Riga City Building Authority.
In spite of the prohibition to carry out any repairs in the upper apartment, from there you will still hear that the construction will continue.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without building permits is between 70 and 700 euros, but in this case, the penalty can be considerably more severe.
While waiting for the expert's opinion, the building board has decided that both apartments should not be operated - both the building and Dmitry's apartment.
"This is not a case in construction practice where, in this way, due to their ignorance or simply displeasure, the inhabitants may have posed a threat not only to their own property, but also to the owner of the ground floor, as a result of which this owner cannot operate his own estate.
Now it is up to Dmitry to look for another place to live - near radios, friends, hotel or rent another apartment.
But the losses incurred by Dmitry may attempt to incur from a neighbor in civil law, which may take a lot of time.
Due to arbitrary construction, it is currently prohibited to stay in both apartments until the construction engineer makes his decision, and it may have to wait up to three weeks.
The losses incurred will have to be covered by the owner of the apartment in which the repairs were carried out.
The owner of this apartment is also threatened with imprisonment for up to six months because the building authorities have not taken into account what they say.
Don't take it!

The transformation of the former Kemer Sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>22 million.
Gita <0xC5><0xBD>elve, representative of Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri, the manager of the upcoming hotel, told the agency LETA that the transformation of the former Kemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" will cost 22 million euros.

The second stage will be the wellness or well-being clinic, which is planned to be opened in 2022, while the hotel’s opening is scheduled for May 2018.
The turtle notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be located in the building of the former Kemer resort polyclinic, which has an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.

In October 2014, "Park Hotel <0xC4><0x8C>emeri" confirmed its willingness to buy the insolvent "Ominasis Latvia" in the auction, but a month later the auction was declared non-existing, because the winner did not pay the debt at the specified time.
The sale price was determined according to the starting price of the last unexisting auction - EUR 2.86 million.
As the agency LETA informed the representative of the city hall Ieva Aile, the municipality, signing the protocol, confirmed that with the support of the European Union Structural Funds co-financing the access infrastructure - to renew the historic <0xC4><0x8C>emeri park interfaces and the construction of the natural interstate.

The former NATO commander Brydlov’s emails were hacked by Russian hackers.
Hackers who hacked the computers of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) may have carried out a number of other cyber attacks, including hacking the emails of former NATO commander Filip Brydlov and the George Soros Institute's "Open Intelligence Society" servers.
Hackers have published information on DCLeaks.com.
There is also a list of B<0xC5><0x99>ídlova and information on the work of the Soros Institute.
For hackers, the institute’s computers have been available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg reports, these cyberattacks were carried out by the same hackers associated with Russian specialists who hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal, in turn, reports that the US President Barack Obama administration is currently considering the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to DNC computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will officially have to prosecute the servers of the Democratic Party against Russian or Russian government-supported hackers in the cyber-attack.
As reported, the WikiLeaks website published in July about 20,000 e-mails that had been obtained from the DNC computer system and from which it is understood that the leaders of the Democratic Party have attempted to damage the party candidates in Sao Tome and Principles in Sao Tome and Principles in Sao Tome and Principles of Sao Tome and Principles of Sao.
According to U.S. media sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the hacking of democratic servers, and other U.S. officials, consider Russia’s connection to the cyberattack to be undeniable.
Makartny: Joko Ono's presence threatened "The Beatles".
Paul McCartney acknowledged that the presence of Joko Ono created a sense of threat from the legendary band The Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star is currently in a "good" relationship with the attraction of the uncle John Lennon, but while she was going to arrest the group at the recording studio, McCartney was her friend, because Ono was the only female member of the group - George Harrison, Harrison,
When the singer was asked about both relationships, he replied to Rolling Stone magazine, "They're really good."
At the time, we felt threatened.
While we were recording, she was sitting on the amplifiers.
The majority of the group could not bear it.
We were able to do this, but not quite successful, because we were very tense.
We weren't sexists, but the girls usually didn't come to the recording studio, they allowed us to work.
When John started meeting Joko, she wasn't sitting in the control room, but in the middle of the four of us.
The Yellow Submarine author also admitted that he now regularly contacts former band member Ringo, and from time to time confirms the recording of the studio's Apple work plans, but otherwise, The Beatles have "overworked".
Asked if he still meets the only living member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine: "Often no."
We meet at social events and parties.
However, I did not attend meetings, and I felt a bit limited to it.
I went from Apple during a severe divorce.
In my place of meeting, I sent John Truthman and said, "Tell me what everyone is saying, because I can't stand sitting at that table."
It was too painful as if you were seeing your pet die.
The company is now working in such a way that I just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA’s Climate Model: Venus Ever Became an Inhabitable Planet
Based on NASA’s latest climate models, Venus has ever been a habitable planet.
NASA’s Godard Institute of Space Studies has developed a model to explore Venus’ history using tools and algorithms that are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water, and whose atmosphere consists almost only of carbon, which has ever been Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have already said in advance that Venus’ slow rotation is due to the dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that Venus once had a plane, an Earth-like atmosphere, and it was slowly declining.
The model also looks at the old topography of Venus.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there was enough water and geographic diversity on it to create life and prevent water from evaporating.
In the early days of Venus, the Sun was 30% brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the Venus rotation model reveals that the light part of the day lasts on it for 2 months, explained the GISS scientist Antonijs Del Genio in a press release.
This process warms the surface of the planet and causes matter, which in turn forms thick layers of clouds, which act as a rain shield, protecting the planet from the sun’s heat.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although once inhabitable, Venus has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet rays for several billions of years.
Its oceans were extinguished, and the vaginas were extinguished by ultraviolet rays.
When the water is fully heated, only a flat carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, as we know it today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from Avalanche's coaching position
On Thursday, Colorado Avalanche coach and hockey operations vice-president Patrick Roy filed a resignation as a reason to argue that there is insufficient influence on the team's decision-making process.
Colorado vice president and general manager Joe Sakek confirmed this message and informed that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been energetic, passionate and purposefully fulfilling my duties as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Club hockey operations," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During this summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve the team’s performance to give it the gloss it needs and achieve the highest level of results.
To achieve this, the visions of the head coach and the vice-president of hockey operations must be fully consistent with the visions of the organization.
He should also be able to influence decisions relating to the performance of the team.
At the moment, these conditions are not met.
Sakis, who owes Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
He said that Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the best coach of the league and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the exclusion games, the Colorado team won the Minnesota hockey team. Since then, the club has not entered the exclusion games for two years.
Avalanche finished the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and left five points behind the Wild team, without obtaining a second special invitation from the organizers of the Western Conference.
Roy won four Stanley cases in his career - two with the Montreal "Canadiens" and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil platform workers resume negotiations and postpone strike
Workers’ strikes on the remuneration of North Sea oil platform workers have been postponed as the negotiations between the two parties to the dispute have resumed, the negotiating leaders said.
Periodic strikes are carried out against the oil-processing company Wood Group on the North Sea oil platforms, where Royal Dutch Shell operates.
The Joint Communication states that Wood Group and Unite and RMT have agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
Over the next few weeks, a number of full-day meetings are scheduled to begin at the beginning of next week with the aim of re-examining the problematic issues.
The trade unions reported that their recent events, organised after more than 25 years of break, are aimed at reducing their wage by 30 percent.
Due to negative market pressure, Wood Group reduced wages for North Sea workers by 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive a market downturn.
Shell has already cut wages for thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimize its work by preparing for a large-scale merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from falling oil prices, and the UK’s decision to leave the European Union makes the situation much more difficult.
Earlier this week, Scottish MP Devs Anderson met with representatives of workers to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vitally important for the economy of the region.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not individually.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost <0x24>1.4 billion, compared to the <0x24>7 billion invested in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of the stars in the Pleiades.
Kepler's latest telescope mission has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalog on the speed of star rotation in the Pleiades star.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in this star rotate at different speeds, as well as how the rate of rotation of stars relates to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass of the stars, the age and even the history of its solar system," said Pasadena Caltech Infrared Process and Centennial.
The Pleiades star is located 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star are just beginning to grow, reaching the age of about 125 million years.
They rotate at the maximum speed.
At the maximum speed of rotation, these rising stars emit a large amount of star wind.
When it gets cold in the magnetic field of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the stars age, their rotation rate decreases.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by determining the time between a recognizable star region, such as the solar flare.
The latest catalog of star rotation rates suggests that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebels compare stars to dancers, larger-grown dancers perform piercings slower than small-grown dancers.
Rebel says that in the "ballet" of Pleiades you can see that the slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, while the faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Due to the fact that the Pleiades star is so close, it serves as a great space laboratory, where you can compare the characteristics of the stars with the speeds of rotation.
Rebels says that the Pleiades star helps to create theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the speed of star rotation is slowing down and about the process of stopping it completely.
Rebul and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of the speed of rotation of the Pleiades stars in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
