Members of the Welsh Assembly (Assembly Members — AM) are concerned about the possibility of "being perceived as comfortable"
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Its cause is plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament"(Welsh Parliament).
AM throughout the political spectrum is concerned that it can make them a laughingstock.
One of the Labour party AM explained that their group is concerned about "resonances with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "uniform", while "pwp" means "cake".
The party Plaid AM stated that none of the group was "satisfied" and recommended alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party acknowledged that their group is ready to consider the name change, but added that "MWP" is very similar to "Muppet", meaning "erm".
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly in English to the Yorkshire dialect "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing to change the name of the bill, informed: "The final decision on the terms to be used for the designation of the members of the Assembly is, of course, to be taken by the members of the Assembly itself."
The Welsh Government (Government of Wales) Act of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation of the proposals, which received extensive support for the rename of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the name of the AM, the Commission preferred the Welsh Parliament Member (WMP), but the MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
AM explicitly suggests alternative options, but the fight for the agreement could bring headaches to Assembly spy Elaine Jones (Elin Jones), who is expected to submit a bill on changes in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes in the work of the Assembly, including laws on disqualification of AM and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on how they will be called will take place after the legislative debate.
Macedonians go to vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether their country name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organised to resolve decades-long disputes with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor makes an impression on claims on its territory, and has already repeatedly objected to Macedonia's request for acceptance by the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, one of the plebiscites on the name change, said he ignored the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply something that needs to be done to enter the EU and NATO.
The call of St. Martin's deity is shattered, the churches of Harlem are fighting for existence.
"As told by the old people I've talked to before, at every corner there was a bar and a deity," says Mr. Adamsa.
"There is no longer one or the other."
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today are socializing in other ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood's living rooms that people visit regularly."
Speaking even to the gods, he is concerned that the money he receives when selling property will end sooner than the leaders hope, "and sooner or later they will return to their starting point."
He added that, for God’s sake, it is possible to replace multi-family buildings with apartment properties where myths will be found by people who will not help the remaining shrines in the area.
"Most of the people who buy apartment properties in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and thus the day is approaching when these gods will close forever, because it is unlikely that most people who buy apartments in these buildings will get into these special apartments."
The two deities were raised by a white congregation, even before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin’s ten years later.
The original White Methodist Society was abandoned in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation who had continued to worship God.
The Black Society of St. Martin's Deity took over during his Holiness John Howard Johnson. He led a boycott of working retailers who had refused to hire black dairy workers at 125th Street, Harlem Main Shopping Street.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as the members of the parish of Father Johnson planned to renovate the building, they ordered a game call.
His Holiness David Johnson (David Johnson), the son of his father and successor in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the game "on the calls of poor people".
The expert, who played this call game in July, used other words: "the treasure of culture" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan added that it was the first call game in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind (Dionisio A. Lind), who moved to the larger call game in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that the Church of St. Martin did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around the goddess of St. Martin reflected the aggregated relationship between architects and builders, some of which had attracted temporary power in the work, while others — the diocese of the episcopal church.
The Council of Councils, composed of interim leaders, in July addressed the diocese in writing with concern that the diocese "will try to transfer costs" to the council, although the council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the activity of the diocese.
Haisis wounded 13-year-old teen at oar fishing site
On Saturday, a hawk in California attacked a 13-year-old boy, who nestled after omers, and injured him. It was the first day of the omars season, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near the beach of Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV Sandjego that he and his friends had been in the kidneys for about half an hour on Saturday morning when they heard the boy called for help, and then with a group came to him to help the boy get out of the water.
Hammels explained that at first he thought it was just an emotion about the captured omar, but then he "understood that the boy was screaming, "I'm saying!
It's my sack!"
All of his key bones were unlocked," said Hammels, who immediately noticed it when he reached the boy.
"I'm asking everyone to throw water: 'There's a shark in the water!'," Hammels added.
The boy was transported by air to Reidy (Rady) Children's Hospital Sandjego, where his condition was recognized as critical.
The species of the attacked shark is not known.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was recognized not to be a dangerous species for humans.
Jayles added that the victim was traumatized to the upper part of the trunk.
Officials closed access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Kasablad to Swami (Swami's) Ensinitas (Encinitas) for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Jails pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to penetrate the UK's beauty industry market
"Sainsbury's" goes to attack "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with universalshop style beauty products shelves and trained sellers.
As part of the UK's significant investment of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion in the large beauty market, which continues to grow despite the decline in sales of fashion goods and household items, 11 stores in the country will be tried in the stores.
In the beauty industry, funds are invested when grocery stores are looking for opportunities to use shelves that were previously allocated to televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's reported that it will double its offerings in the field of beauty care up to 3000 products, including brands such as "Revlon", "Essie", "Tweezerman" and, for the first time, "Dr. PawPaw".
Existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with branded areas similar to those in the Boots stores.
The grocery store also re-markets its "Boutique" line of decorative cosmetics, in which most of the products will be vegan friendly — which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers in the years to come.
In addition, fragrance wholesaler "Fragrance Shop" will try a concession in two stores "Sainsbury's", the first of which was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, but the second will be opened in Seliouka (Selly Bir) in the
Online shopping and the transition to small grocery shopping every day in local stores means that grocery stores need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury's Executive Director Mike Coupe has said that the merchandise trading venues will become increasingly similar to universal stores, as the chain of stores is trying to fight with discount stores "Aldi" and "Lidl", offering a wider range of services, without a backpack.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos' trading venues in several hundred stores and has opened several "Habitats" since the purchase of both chains two years ago, which is said to have improved the wear and tear of goods and made the purchased more profitable.
The previous attempt of the store to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in ruins.
Sainsbury's joint venture with Boots was attempted in the early 2000s, but the union broke out after a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from pharmacy goods stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after Sainsbury's sold its 281 stores' large pharmaceutical business Celesio to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million 3 years ago.
Under this plan, the task of "Lloyds" will be to supplement the range with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including "Roche-Posay"and "Vichy", in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, said: "To improve the customer-designed environment, we have transformed the look of our beauty products' shelves and what they create.
We have also invested funds in specially trained colleagues, who will always be willing to give advice.
The range of our brands is designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment with a convenient location means that we are now an enchanting target on the road to beauty, a target that challenges the current shopping habits."
Peter Johns 'full of nickname' after Holly Willoughby resigns from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
"Dragon Den" star Peter Jones "takes over the disgrace" after TV broadcaster Holly Willoughby resigned from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to pay all attention to his new contracts and the Spencer's "ITV"
Vilouby has no time to devote to the seal "Truly" of their home clothes and accessories.
The couple's business was compared to the Guinean Paltrow (Gwyneth Paltrow) brand "Goop".
The 37-year-old broadcaster used Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoubia has abandoned "Dragon Den" star Peter Jones infuriated, because in the last moment he left his profitable lifestyle brand business — to pay all attention to his new huge contracts with "Marks & ITV" and "Spencer".
Information sources claim that Jones was "full of nickname" when a TV gold girl was squeezed during a meeting on Tuesday at her business empire residence in Marlow, Bakinghamshire, announced that her new contracts with her mother-in-law, or her mother-in-law, were not worth up to 1.5 million dollars.
The company was compared to the Guinea Plato brand "Goop", and according to the household, it will double the wealth of Vilaubiya, which is estimated to reach 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) used Instagram to announce that he left "Truly", Jones took away from the UK to one of his holiday homes.
As told by a source of information: ""Truly" was the very main of Holly's priorities.
It should have become her long-term future, which would be dedicated to the next decade.
Her decision to leave surprised all the unprepared participants.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
The centre of Marlowa has a warehouse for full sale of finished goods."
Experts believe that "This Morning" drivers, who are one of the most financially profitable stars, going away can cost the company millions, because a lot of money has been invested in a variety of products — from pillows and candles, to the purchase of more clothing and clothing.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Three children's mother Willoubia and her husband Den Boldwin (Dan Baldwin) have been in a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Kep (Tara Capp) for 10 years.
Willoubia "Truly" was founded together with Kepu in 2016, and 52-year-old Johns joined as president in March.
Both couples spend holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in the Boldvina TV producer company.
Viloubia is set to become the M&S brand's ambassador, and she will replace Entu McPartlin as ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" manager.
A source close to Jones said yesterday: "We don't want to comment on his business transactions!"
Serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He complained about the criticism he would receive from news companies about comments that some might consider "inappropriate to the president" and that he was so positively referring to the North Korean leader.
Why is the President so much as resigned?
Trump said in his pictured "the message dictator's voice."
"I don't know who!"
He pointed out that Kim has shown interest in meeting once again after Trump recognized his initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, denuclearisation negotiations have ceased.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of the main North Korean diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, informed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "response" to the North Koreans.
Instead, he pointed out, the U.S. continues sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
Trump was much more optimistic in his mythic speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We now have these great relationships."
He said that what he did to improve relations with Kim had given positive results — the discontinuation of missile testing, assistance in the release of hostilities, and the return of the remaining U.S. troops.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to make the impression of a president, but instead of standing outside with 10,000 people trying to get into this tightly populated area, we have 200, look, here," Trump said, pointing to the effort right in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia Seize the Island, Killing Hundreds of People
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
While more than 10 percent of the Lombok population were displaced, the state of the national disaster was not declared, but this is necessary in order to propose foreign assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they made it very clear that they did not ask for international assistance, so that is a problem," said Mrs. Sumbunga.
While "Save Children" collects groups for riding to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
The representative of the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutopo, explained that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation of Palu in order to see if international agencies will be able to contribute to their assistance.
Given the regular occurrence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still extremely vulnerable to natural disasters.
Although Aceh (Aceh) has been formed by suicide tsunami cases, they are rarely found along other coasts.
The deaths were also likely affected by the fact that Paul did not respond to the warning syrenes of the tsunami, even though the warning was in force.
Even at the most favorable times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship-hospital, which had sank in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims, is now heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new postage.
President Joko Widodo (Joko Widodo) had made improvements to Indonesia's collapsed infrastructure the central point of his election campaign, and he has allocated large sums to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has taught Mr. Joko's administration, and he is expected to run for re-election next year.
Moreover, Mr. Joko has to deal with the prolonged problem created by tension between sects in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets, using machetes, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: "Liverpool" player Daniels Starridge with ambition to restore balance in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, earning goals in the 89th minute at Saturday's Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Staridz received a draw from Xherdan Shaqiri, being about 25 metres (30 yards) from Chelsea's goal when his team lost by 1-0.
He moved the ball a little to the left of himself and then pushed the ball in the direction of the other goal post.
In this attempt, the ball flew high across the field, reaching the top right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball flew over the head of Kepa Arrizabalaga (Kepa Arrizabalaga) in the jump and landed on the net.
"I'm just trying to get that position to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as far ahead as I can, so I'm just trying to get myself as much time as possible," said Starigz.com LiverpoolFC.
"I saw Kante approaching, hitting the ball, and, without much thought, playing."
Chelsea were in the lead by 1-0 after the Belgian star Eden Hazard took the words in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker tied the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before cutting to the middle of the field and jumping as fast as possible at the side of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>s quickly played and got the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful sit-in between the players, allowing Azard to get into the area.
Azards overtook the speed defense and finished the combination, with his left leg doing a sit-in at the far side of the net, losing Liverpool to Elison Becker (Alison Becker).
In the Champions League stage on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m., Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy) will fight against Naples.
Chelsea with Videoton will be held in London on Thursday at 3 p.m. in the UEFA European League.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunami victims in Indonesia has reached 832, the state disaster agency said early on Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the mines of buildings after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which hit the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (<0x7E>6.0 m) of high waves, a spokesman for the news conference told the agency Sutopo Purpovo Nugroho (Nugroho).
Other cities, with more than 380,000 people, were covered by ruined buildings.
Police suspected of rape of a woman arrested by a 32-year-old man
An investigation into the seizure was initiated after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7:55 p.m., in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a suspected 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police have called on people in this area to apply who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The search has just begun, but I would like to invite everyone who was on John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have fixed something in their car video recorder materials, to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead, and she was found in her property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and, according to the police, they are engaged in informing the closest relatives of the bridge.
The driver of the taxi, who lives in Greyson Lake, tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He was unable to say a word when he found out what had happened.
People are informed that it will take hours until they are allowed to return.
It was heard as a policeman told a man that the whole scene was perceived as the scene of the crime.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene of the crime.
She goes on to say, "It's so horrible!"
At two o’clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another one was located right outside.
Several policemen were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the multi-family house.
Everyone who has information is asked to use DM <0x40>MerPolCC by September 30, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers anonymously" by phone 0800 555 111 at 247.
Kromvela Statue in Parliament becomes the latest "history rewriting" scandal
The resignation would be ethically justified, given the Taliban-like activities that resulted in his fanatical Puritan followers gathering so many monuments to England's culture and religion.
However, Kromvela society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the target would also be the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Castle.
Cromwell himself did not command or carry out the excavation of sacred tombs during the English Civil War.
It is possible that the wrong Cromwell will be injected because of the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, who lived centuries earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's beautiful depiction of Cromwell shows a 19th-century view and is part of the historiography of a person that many believe is still worth praising.
Mr Goldsmith reported to the Sunday Telegraph: "Many Cromwells, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than they are today, considered Parliament's defender against external pressure, which, in his case, was of course a monarchy.
Historical discussions will continue on whether this is really a completely accurate representation of the subject.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognizable personality, representing one of the sides of the long-standing divide.
What she achieved, being a Lord Protector, is worthy of praise and mention."
Pig squirrels to death squirrels in China
According to local media, the pig market in the southwest of China attacked a farmer and killed him.
The man — his name is mentioned only by John (Yuan) — was found dead with an overdose artery, all in one blood at a pig's nest in the market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
Pigs are going to be vaccinated for pig on 30 May 2005 in a pig carcase in Xining, China, in Qinghai Province.
It is reported that he and his nephew had left the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his brother found the man dead and discovered that the door of the pork next door was standing open.
He said that a large pig dude with blood on his mouth was found in the pig’s booth.
According to the information of the court medical investigation confirmed that 550 pounds (<0x7E>249 kg) of heavier calf had been crushed by the farmer.
"My brother's legs were bloody and bloody," said the brother, referring only to his name Vu (Wu), the article "Guiyang Evening News".
The security camera material showed how Jua<0xC5><0x86>s entered the market on Thursday at about 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed John did not belong to him or his brother-in-law.
The market manager informed "Evening News" that the shop was turned on to prevent its attacks on others while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to information, Juan’s family and market management are discussing compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, other pig attacks on humans are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man at their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in critical injuries.
10 years ago, a pig weighing 650 pounds (<0x7E>295 kg) in Wales held a farmer by the tractor until the animal was intimidated by his wife.
After farmers in Oregon fed her pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba, CBC News, explained that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the blood taste can act as a "gun shot".
"They're just playful.
They like to invade, they are very curious ... they don’t want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
Hurricane Rose's conclusion brings wide and strong cases in the US southwest
As predicted, Hurricane Rose, moving across the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico, will weaken.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding-causing rain gases in the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At five o’clock in the afternoon (in North American Eastern Time), the wind breeze reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour) corresponding to a Category 1 hurricane, and its point was 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, a low-pressure envelope is formed that moves eastwards towards the US east coast. Roses with tropical storm force approaching the Peninsula of Lower California (Bay California), on Monday it will begin moisture-massing in the northwest of the US.
Pink on Monday in part of Mexico will bring up to 10 inches (<0x7E>25.4 cm) of rain.
Then tropical humidity, interacting with nearby low-pressure plateau, will create a wide heavy rainfall zone in the Southwest in the nearest days.
1–4 inches (<0x7E>2.6–10.2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous sudden flooding, dusk currents and possibly landslides in the desert.
Depths of moisture from the tropical strip will cause rain gases that will reach 2–3 inches (<0x7E>5.1–7.6 cm) per hour in some places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona, up to 24 inches (<0x7E>5.2–10.1 cm) of rain is expected.
There is a possibility of sudden flooding with a rapid deterioration of the condition due to the spread of tropical rainfall.
It is very unwanted to walk in the desert due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but it will not always bring local wind and sandy storms.
A low-pressure envelope will bring a local strong case to part of the South California coastline.
There is a possibility of rain gases, which together will exceed half an inch (<0x7E>1.3 cm), and this can cause small dusk flows and sliding paths.
This will be the first rain gas in the region during the rainy season.
Some of the tropical rainfall in Arizona will begin approaching late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain will take over wider territory late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread on Tuesday in the Four Corners region (DR Colorado, DA Juta, NA Arizona and DR Jaunmexica) and will last all Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S., as Arctic temperatures are falling, but the tropics are still quite hot.
Sometimes it causes dramatic changes in the temperature at a short distance.
This is a dramatic example of temperature differences on Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The difference between temperatures in the city of Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and in Senluis and Demoine (Des Moines), Aiova, varies by almost 20 degrees.
The next few days will try to form and expand the long-lasting summer heat.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the U.S. are expected to be warm in early October, with temperatures reaching 80 degrees Celsius (after Farenheit; <0x7E>27 degrees Celsius) in wide areas from the southern plains to the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees (after Farenheit; <0x7E>27 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts suggest a high probability that in the first half of October, temperatures in the eastern part of the U.S. will exceed averages.
More than 20 million people watched a hearing in the Breta Caveno case
More than 20 million people watched six television channels on Thursday with enthusiasm, as evidenced by Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kaveno in her 80’s.
Meanwhile, the political undivided continued, with broadcasters discontinuing regular broadcasting to report on Friday’s latest turnaround: an agreement organised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FIB will investigate charges for weeks.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Caveno had cheated on her drunk and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kaveno relentlessly testified that he was fully convinced that this was not the case.
According to Nielsen on Friday, it was watched by 20.4 million people.
CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded the interest of average viewers.
Data on other broadcasting organisations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this, were not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" usually comes up with problems, including people who are watching in the offices.
For a better idea, this number of spectators corresponds to the number of exclusion games or "Oscar" ceremonies.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kaveno's appointment, had the highest number of viewers, an average of 5.69 million over a full day of hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS attracted 3.1 million, NBC — 2.94 million, MSNBC — 2.89 million, and CNN — 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
Interest also remained high after listening.
Fleek was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican team published a statement that he would vote for Caveno’s appointment, the senator noticed the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, when he, accompanied by calls from the protesters, tried to get to the Justice Committee hearings by lift.
On CNN, he stood for several minutes with his eyes closed as he was removed.
"I'm standing here right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
He was told that "he owns power as long as so many women are powerless."
Fleik explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he was informed that he had more to say at the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasting networks were reflected live hours later when the Committee on Justice was preparing to vote on Kaveno's appointment to vote in the Senate.
However, Fleik claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FIB would look into the charges against the candidates next week, which were demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Fleik partially convinced talks with his friend Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After negotiations with the Corps and several other senators, Fleiks made his decision.
Fleik’s choice was significant because it was clear that Republicans would not have a vote to approve Kaveno without an investigation.
President Trump has commissioned the FIB to investigate the allegations made against Kavenaugh.
British Prime Minister Meja accuses critics of Brexit in political games
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused people of "political games" with Britain's future and of harassing national interests, criticizing her plans to leave the European Union.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, next to an interview on the front page of her newspaper, Maya's former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continues to attack her Brexit plan for the future of Britain's relations with the European Union, the so-called "Chequers plan", underlining the EU's single-handed "towards the Lisinian tariff".
Type of Sims Shooting: Police Arrested Diteon Simpson Suspected of the Murder of an LSU Player
Police have arrested suspected of the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The 20-year-old Diteon Simpson (Dyteon Simpson) was arrested and arrested as an accused of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge police station.
Officials released a video showing Sims collision with Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the coup.
CBS subsidiary WAFB reports that police have found the glasses at the crime scene and Simpson's blood has been found on them.
After Simpson was discovered, the police reported that he had confessed to Faida's shooting.
According to the lawyer, he was given <0x24>350,000 in security.
A team of forensic experts from the East Baton Rouge Parish on Friday issued a provisional ruling stating that the death was caused by a bullet in the head that struck the neck.
The Department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Search Operational Group, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the University of the South Police and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation, which resulted in the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local lawmakers for their "education and work in the name of fairness".
Simss was 20 years old.
6-foot 6-inch (<0x7E>1.98 m) long attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wien also played basketball LSU.
In the last season, in one game, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 dropping balls.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "stricken" and "shocked" about Wayne's death.
"That's what a person is always concerned about," said Wayne.
Volcano sprinkles ashes across Mexico
The mounds rising from the Pocatello Volcano have reached the southernmost parts of Mexico's capital.
After activity in the crater was observed and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcano.
The Centre has observed repeated depression and tremor.
Images on social networks showed that car windshields in the area of Mexico, such as Hochimilco (Xochimilco), are present with a flat ash layer.
Geophysicists have noticed a volcanic activation 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a clash of independent protesters with public order police and when thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote for separation.
A group of masked segregation supporters, delayed by the public order police, coated them with eggs and threw them in powdery paint, forming dark dust clouds in the streets, which would normally be full of tourists.
The clashes were also raised later that day, and the police used sticks to prevent the stings.
For hours, independent groups of supporters chanting "Don't forget and don't forgive!" were involved in the confrontation with unanimous protesters who chanted "Life to Spain!"
According to local newspapers, fourteen people were given medical assistance due to minor injuries sustained during protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but which the Catalan people rejected, the idea of independence in the occupied region remains under great tension.
The voters expressed convincingly in favour of independence, although voter activity was low, and those who were against the separation were mostly boycotted.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region, and there were ruthless clashes.
Independence groups had derailed on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer expects Catalonia to gain independence.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with tears of joy that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the parties supporting Catalonia's independence won the regional elections last year with a small but significant overwhelming majority, these parties have struggled to keep moving this year, because some of the best known leaders are not familiar with the fact that they have either been organised and emigrated or have emigrated.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who filmed protests on the phone in support of police, said the conflict had been provoked by politicians from both sides.
"The excitement is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine leaders of Catalonia, Uriol Junqueras, who has been imprisoned since last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way to disguise the regression and repression of democratic values that the Spanish government has directed against us," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after meddling with a car in a building
Three men (33, 34 and 39 years old) were arrested after the car was repeatedly hit by a building in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Balinagardkre<0xC5><0xA1>tenta (Ballynagard Crescent) on Thursday at approximately 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings (Bob Blemmings) reported that the gate and also the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that the machine was simultaneously fired from the shell.
Menge strike allows Livingston to win the Rangers by 1-0
Dolly Meng’s first goal secured a win for Livingston
Supported Livingston shocked the Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard his second loss in 18 games in the role of manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be decisive because the Gary Holt team levelled the situation with the Hibernian.
The Gerard team did not win the guests this season, and on the following Sunday they must meet the leader of "Hearts", from which they are left by eight points.
This is the first time that the European League has been held by the Rangers on Thursday in Vienna.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his series without losses in the division to six games, and head coach Holt has not yet tasted the spoiler, since last month replaced Kenya Miller (Kenny Miller).
"Livingston" does not take advantage of the opportunity against bad guests
Holt's team with their live game, which in a variety of ways made it difficult for the Rangers, had to be in charge long before they won the words.
Scott Robinson (Scott Robinson) kicked out, but delayed his attempt in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow (Alan Lithgow) attempt after sliding into his legs to stop Craig Halkett from hitting the side with his head over the gate.
The hosts allowed the "Rangers" to play in front of them, knowing that they will be able to stop guests in the planned locations.
And that's exactly how the decisive gates came.
The Rangers allowed a free space, and the Livingston used a corridor, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson merged to give opportunity to Meng, who sewed and knocked the gates from the middle of the zone.
At this stage, the Rangers managed the ball, but the protection of the guests proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly) was not particularly disturbed.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos led Kelli to save the goal.
Scott Pitman's attempt was interrupted by Alan MacGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, and Litgov missed the goal in a combination of Livingston.
In the Livingston area, centered balls continued to appear, but two appeals for punishment — after Halketa’s fight for the ball with deputy Glenn Middleton and for hand-playing — were rejected.
"Fenomenal" "Livingston" performance — analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdairs Lamont (Alasdair Lamont) at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was great at continuing to overcome expectations, increasing the performance.
The style and character of their game has practically not changed since returning to the highest echelon, but Holt deserves great praise for how he has joined the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett (Halkett) was honoured to maintain a primarily organized defense, while Meng was in charge of keeping Connor Goldson (Connor Goldson) and Joe Worrall (Joe Worrall) always sober.
But the Rangers are lacking inspiration.
No matter how good they were at times under Gerard, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was boring — only once they came into the field of the landlords — and this is essentially a call to retreat from the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan in Cologne with shared feelings awaited
Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin, there was a lot of smiling and blue skies.
It is the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have litigation on a variety of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
The police, as a reason for mining security, blocked a large effort of 25,000 people, preventing them from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — most of them Kurds — also expressed their views, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to take him with them.
The mutual protests of the two sides reflect the contradictions created by guests, some of whom consider the Germans to be heroes, while others consider themselves to be autocrats.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies in collision with a car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a high-speed road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and gave help to the doctor, but the man died at the scene.
The collision took place several months after another cyclist died on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash site on Sunday, when the driver left the crash site.
The police department of the capital said that police are engaged in identifying the man and informing his or her relatives.
On the scene of the event, roads are closed and buses are diverted, but drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six employees injured during riots
The Prison Office reports that six prison workers were injured in riots in a male-strict prison.
The unrest arose in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Vorküstershire at about 09.30 BST on Sunday and still continues.
In order to prevent riots involving eight detainees who are confined to one wing, the staff of the special service Tornado were involved.
Employees were treated with mild facial injuries at the scene.
A representative of the prison service said: "In order to solve the incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison personnel were involved.
Six staff members were provided with medical assistance due to injuries.
We will not be satisfied with the violence in our prisons and say clearly that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will probably spend more time behind bars."
The HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 detainees, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated in a hospital after the prisoner's attack.
And in October last year, staff responsible for the control of dumps were sent to prison to resolve serious unrest in which staff had been attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa Phoenix, Las Vegas and Soltleikitia threatened with sudden flooding (possibly benefiting the drought-affected areas)
Arizona suffers from tropical depression rarely, but that is likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa with the remaining force moves across the deserted southwest, creating a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden floods Monday and Tuesday for the western part of Arizona, the southern and eastern part of Nevada, the southeastern part of California, the southeastern part of California, and the southeastern part of Southeastern California, and the southeastern part of Southeastern California.
It is expected that Rosa will move directly across the Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving with the case late Monday.
According to the National Meteorological Service in Phoenix on Twitter, since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles (320 km) of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles (65 km) from the borders of AZ."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2–4 inches (<0x7E>5.08–10.2 cm) of rainfall, reaching up to 6 inches (15.24 cm) in some places.
Other desert areas in the southwest of the country, including the central part of the Klins Mountains and the Great Pool, are likely to receive 1–2 inches (<0x7E>2.54–5.08 cm), reaching up to 4 inches (<0x7E>10.2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not at the risk of sudden flooding, the rains of Roza can be a blessing because the region has been plagued by drought.
While the possibility of flooding is a very serious concern, part of the rainfall is likely to benefit, as the southwest is currently suffering from drought.
According to the US drought monitor, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the Hurricane Pink road leads to the Lower California peninsula in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Rose is still hurricane-powered on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, located about 385 miles (<0x7E>620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km).
The wind meets the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean and is therefore accustomed to it.
Therefore, the hurricane with tropical storm force is expected to reach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
Part of the rain gas in Mexico can be strong, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that rain gases will reach 3–6 inches (7.62–15.24 cm) from the Lower California area in the southwest of Sonora, likely to reach 10 inches (25.4 cm)," weather.com reported.
Rose will move north, cross Mexico as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then cross Arizona and arrive in the south of Yugoslavia on Tuesday afternoon.
"The main threat expected from Roza or its residues is very strong rainfall in Lower California, the northwestern part of Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that these rains will cause life-threatening sudden flooding and dusk-flowing deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsommer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempting to Kill
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 BST.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition remains "stable".
The police reported that two 17-year-olds and two 18-year-olds, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested overnight in the area of Redstock (Radstock), Eivona and Somerset.
The police have called on anyone who might have a mobile phone material at their disposal to recall what happened.
Trump claims that Caveno has suffered from "badness and anger" from the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Caveno is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless and violent tactics," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stressed that Caveno has suffered from "badness and anger" from the Democratic Party throughout the process of his nomination.
Caveno witnessed in front of Congress, where he energeticly and emotionally denied any allegations of sexual harassment by Christiane Blasey Ford several decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed his allegations in the course of the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that on that day "the Americans saw" Caveno "the excellence, the ability and the courage."
"The vote on the approval of Judge Caveno is a vote to endorse one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a brilliant history of serving the people," he said in a statement.
President Kaveno mentioned the circumstances when he spoke of the importance of Republican activity in the midterm elections.
“We’ve had weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I was not a candidate, but in fact I was a candidate," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats have undertaken the mission of "protecting and resisting".
The first of the important procedural votes in the Senate on Caveno’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is increasing
Officials said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many simply washed away when giant waves hit the shores after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday at the festival in the city of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered on the beach holidays, when up to six meters (18 feet) high waves hit the coastal chair, sweeping many to death and destroying everything that was on their way.
Tsunami emerged after a powerful earthquake of 7.5 balls.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still working on the beach and did not flee immediately, and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for BNPB's Disaster Reduction Agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"Cunami did not come alone, it brought cars, beams and buildings, it draught everything that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami, before hitting the coast, had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
"Many people ran into coconuts to save themselves, and survived," he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photos taken by the disaster agency on the flight show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and broken bridges, and a water-filled mosque.
After midnight, the coastal city continued to shake on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in the territory of 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stressed that the energy released during Friday's massive earthquakes was about 200 times higher than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped to Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho's injuries were described as "wide" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels have collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruined buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number of casualties and injuries could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala (Donggala), closest to the earthquake epicenter.
“The communication was completely destroyed, no information was received from Dongal,” Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are travelling to disaster-affected regions.
"It's already a tragedy, but everything could have been even worse," the organization said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not informing that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials claimed that the waves arrived during the warning.
When you hear a video on social networks that the man on the top floor of the building desperately calls people on the bottom of the street that the tsunami is approaching.
Within a few minutes, the water wall hits the shore, washing the buildings and machines.
The Reuters news agency was unable to immediately verify whether the material was real.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a serious loss of electricity supply, which disconnected Palu from communication, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials said that the army has begun to send trucks with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need food and other essential goods.
The city airport is open only for relief events and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo (Joko Widodo) planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Mr Doseba (Doseba) said that the World Vision staff, who had successfully reached the city of Palu from Dongala (Dongala), and now sat in the office yard in the spring in the yard, lost their way to the damaged areas.
"They told us that they saw a lot of buildings that had been demolished," he explained.
It's very bad.
Even when the aid teams were determined to start organizing assistance to the victims of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with great experience were not allowed to go to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian legislation, funding, resources and staff of overseas organisations may only arrive if the post area is declared as a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Indonesian Red Cross representative Aulia Ariani (Aulia Arriani).
"When the government declares, 'Okay, it's a national disaster,' we will be able to accept international assistance, but such a status has not yet been determined."
When Palu arrived on the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the people who were still missing continued to hope that their loved ones would become miracles that would make life darker during natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the notebook.
On Sunday, the woman, who had been imprisoned under the mines for two days, was rescued by the rescuers, next to her mother's crib.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, had prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others of the inmates at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi (Mandagi), were his pupils.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I'm learning how to create emotions."
Mr. Gendon recalled that after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread on the paraglider team, he sent WhatsApp messages for hours, desperately, to the Palu contestants who participated in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
"I think it means that the reports did not reach the addressee," he said.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Newport on the Levee, Newport on the Levee, Newport on the Levee
According to a statement by the Newport Police Department, the robbers stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's employee on Friday morning, who filled the ATM at the Newport on the Levee complex.
“The driver of the car emptied the entertainment complex ATM and was preparing to fill it with a larger amount of money,” Detective Denis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the driver was busy, another man "attacked the Brink's employee from behind" and stole the money with the ATM.
According to a press release, witnesses spotted several suspects leaving the scene of the crime, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police 859-292-3680.
Kanje Vests: repertoire changes its name to Je
The repertoire Kanje West changes its name to Ye (Je).
In announcing the replacement on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A being who knows beforehand as Kanji West."
The 41-year-old West had for some time been called Je, and used the cover as the name of his eighth album, which was released in June ("Ye").
This change takes place before his appearance on the show "Saturday Night Live," in which he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
The creators of the show say that he replaced the singer Arianu Grandi, who stopped working on "emotional causes".
Vests has said that this is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it also has a religious significance.
"I believe that 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You'," West explained earlier this year, discussing his album's name with the radio director Big Boy (Big Boy).
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
Initially there was Kanje, meaning "only one, followed by "Ye", which is thinking about the good and the bad in us, about our regrets, about everything.
The album is more thoughtful about who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, has announced that he prefers the words Love (Love) and Brother Love (Brother Love).
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with the West, both has and has not used a sign of thought and capital letters.
Mexico’s president-elect vows not to use the army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador) has pledged never to use military force against civilians at the time of the 50th anniversary of the bloody return of students.
Lopes Obrador's "Tlatelolco Plaza" on Saturday promised "never use an army to oppress the Mexican people."
The peaceful demonstration of the army unit was carried out on 2 October 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopes Obradors has vowed to support young Mexicans in the years by granting scholarships to students each month and opening more public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and education opportunities bring young people into the gangs of criminals.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is becoming more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains Kai Fu Lee (Kai-Fu Lee), an investor and artificial intelligence practitioner who has worked on "Google" and "Microleft".
Comments were made after various U.S. government bodies have made statements on artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a general strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
China, meanwhile, launched its plan last year: its goal is to become a major country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A dual budget for AI research will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so deeply behind the U.S., and the next cardinal shift in AI is expected," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence would take place in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" ("The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order") was published this month in "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", is a "Sinnovation Ventures" single-handedly co-director.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University (Carnegie-Melon) he worked to create an artificial intelligence system that would beat America's best "Othello" (Reversi) player, but later he was a "Microsoft Research" predecessor and executive of "Microsoft Research".
Lee recognized previous US government-organized technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the idea would be prepared to identify the robotic challenge in the Defense Avant-garde Research Agency.
"Scientists in the U.S. often have to work very hard to get government grants," said Law.
"It's not China that attracts leading scientists, it's big companies," he explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have eased the sparks of universities working on artificial intelligence.
He added that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically awarded to people with a PhD in Artificial Intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
Lee explained that the Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. Department of Defense) established a joint joint artificial intelligence center, which is intended to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on the subject of art.
And this month DARPA (the Central Research and Development Organization of the U.S. Department of Defense) announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in the initiative called "AI Next".
The National Science Fund is currently investing more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation, which was tasked with setting up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has been in operation for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the "Republic of North Macedonia", taking a step to prevent decades-long litigation with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join Europe.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, stresses that its northern neighbor's name indicates claims on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but the opposition nationalists insist that the changes involved the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov has said that the vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott has raised concerns about whether voter activity will reach at least 50% of what is needed for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum bulletin raises the question: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership in the conclusion of an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, becoming an organization, such as the EU and the NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MEPs have declared that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
In order to change the name, a 2/3 majority will be required in Parliament.
The National Election Commission informed that no violations were reported until 1 p.m.
However, the activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections, in which 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I'm going to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Josie Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorica (Zorica) and their son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko (Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko) cast their votes in the referendum in Macedonia on the change of national name that will pave the way for NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Strumica) in Macedonia on 30 September 2018
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov (Vladimir Kavardarkov), prepared a small stage and arranged chairs at the tents that had been set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to act with our heads up, not through the doors of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a small country, but we have a self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zayev claims that NATO participation will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will vote for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result "yes" "will confirm our future".
The Macedonian Institute for Policy Research (Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research) poll published on Monday shows that 30-43 percent of the voters will participate in the referendum — less than the required activity.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of the voters planned to participate in the vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them responded that they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voting rate must be 50 per cent and one more vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the West-oriented government that came to power in May last year.
See also: Manchester's "City" Serhio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) will march through the whole "Brighton" protection to get the gates
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling joined the Brighton defense by allowing City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England to win by 2-0.
Agvero gave the impression that the advantage of his gate in the 65th minute was ridiculously light.
The Argentine attacker received a match in the middle of the field at the beginning of the combination.
He flew between the three Brighton defenders, and shot himself in the open space.
Then Agvero wears four green shirts.
He threw the ball to one defender, then in the runner over several more "Brighton" sides of the field.
Then he made a draw on the left, reaching Sterling.
The attacker of the English center used his first touch to replay Agvero, who put a good football shoe in the case to beat Brigton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, hitting the ball on the right side of the net.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," City manager Peps Gardiola (Pep Guardiola) told reporters.
"We discussed the game with him for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he got the gates at the time.
However, it was Sterlings who provided the Sky Blues with the original advantage in the Premier League race.
The gate was reached in the 29th minute.
Agvero in the game got the ball deep in the "Brighton" territory.
He sent the ball with a beautiful leg along Leroy Sane's left leg.
In Sana'a, he held several sieges until Sterling was entrusted to deliver the ball to the next goalkeeper.
The attacker of the Sky Blues Center easily landed the ball in the net just before crossing the border.
"City" will play against Hoffenheim Champions League team on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Zinshaim, Germany.
The actor wants to bring problems "Rockies"
Since "Nationals" is not participating in the exclusion games, there was no reason to restart yet.
However, Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to take advantage of the opportunity against Colorado "Rockies", but only if "Rockies" will be up-to-date exclusion games. And "Rockies" in the National League West group.
The Rockies have issued at least a white card on Friday night with a 5:2 win for the Nationals, but have not yet won their first title in the division.
"While we play the same way, we can at least have fun knowing that the airfield here in Denver, with effort and the other team, will probably be the most damaging I've ever faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
"National" has not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but, as reported, is ready to allow Shercer to take a shot.
The actor, for whom it will be the 34th, held a shooting session on Thursday in the "bullpen" part of the outdoors, and on Sunday, during the usual rest, the ball will be thrown.
The Washington lab is 18–7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Holds Myths in West Virginia
The President mentioned the situation in which his chosen Supreme Court candidate Brett Kaveno entered, while discussing the importance of the Republican electorate's activity in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is in danger in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It’s really very, very serious — I didn’t apply, but I actually applied, and that’s why I’m everywhere and fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrific, horrific group of radical Democrats acting right now.
And they are committed to regaining power by all means possible to achieve the goal. You see evil, opposing actions.
They have no matter what they hurt, what they have to violate to gain power and control, that’s why they want to gain power and control, and we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, have undertaken the mission of "protecting and resisting".
"And you have seen it yourself in the last four days," he stressed, calling the Democrats "nothing, evil, random and untrue."
He called on behalf of the Senate Committee on Justice the Democratic Party Senator Diana Feinstein (Dianne Feinstein), to which the audience responded with loud calls.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you sneak the document?
Hmm, what's the matter?
No, uh, wait -- it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is insensitive to the open
It was no wonder that the Momentum activists in my local party wanted to censor me.
After all, I am so far the last member of the Labour Party to be informed that he does not want to – all because we do not hide our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, and I did a similar thing because she was determined to oppose anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of an economically responsible policy, national security, Europe — ironically, but these were issues in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of the Labour Party in the eastern part of Nottingham on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of my eight local MPs in this House were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, in today's many meetings, the atmosphere is different and promises of a "better, more delicate" policy have long been forgotten, if ever.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate differing opinions, and any opinion is assessed depending on whether this is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader: colleagues who thought our political views were similar began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept opinions that I would never accept, alone, or in other cases agree with, the EU, or not.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – I follow the tyranny of using social networks, calling for a ban on candidates for the next elections, disguising the policy of the centre, claiming that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more successful than some of my colleagues, because my comments are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face daily streams of sexist and racist insults, but never try to avoid obedience.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal exploitation has become.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party must excavate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organization that is ready for diversity and with every expression of distrust or change in selection rules, the party will shrink.
During the last two years, I have often given advice, calling on not to run, think about what I am talking about, and then with me "everything will be okay".
But that’s not why I decided to take part in politics.
Since I joined the LeBorists 32 years ago as a student, in response to the failure of the Techers government, which had literally led my integrated school class to collapse, I have set out to fight for the best public services in the LeBor – the smartest ones who need such praise.
I have never concealed my political views, even in previous elections.
No one in the East of Nottingham had any reason to doubt my position on political issues and in areas where I would not agree with the existing government.
To those who made the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country is moving firmly towards Brexit, which will harm our households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party.
However, in essence, the only thing I want to announce is not the "Momentum" note, but to their voters, regardless of whether they are members of the legislature: I am proud that I can serve you, and I promise that there is no threat of cheating or any reminders that I have no one in my policy.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unsolicited "Ayr" reaches the top rows in the table
The last two attempts may seem to be the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that Ayr has deserved to triumph in this stunningly exciting Scottish championship game today.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only unsolicited team out of ten.
After all, it was both their great defense and the much better use of opportunities that drove the hosts, and the coach, Peter Murchie, has every reason to be satisfied.
"We've tested all of our games and we're still not happy, so I have to be happy," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "All the respect for Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, realised by Freiizer Climo, put "Ayr", but the yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, where he was awarded "Warriors" (Warriors), and "Battle" Jasper D.
Climate increased the leadership of "Ayr" with a penalty, right at the end of the half-time, he earned points, then realised a solo attempt, so the "Ayr" in the break went by 17-5.
However, the Melrose half-life started with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, realised by Begots, reduced backwardness to 5 points.
Then a long break took place because Ruaridh Knott suffered a severe injury and was taken to the docks away from the field, but when the game resumed "Ayr" quickly moved forward when Stafford McDowell (Stafford McDowall) made a realistic appearance.
"Ayr's former captain Bleir Macpherson (Blair Macpherson) then received a yellow card, and again, after intense pressure, "Melrose" used a surplus player — with an attempt by Bruce Colvin (Bruce Colvine) that was not realized.
However, the hosts clashed, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stealing Clima without a ball from the penalty corridor, McFerson performed a tachada "Ayr" mole in the back.
Climate realised the ball, as before, almost from the very beginning after Kails Rowe (Kyle Rowe) overthrew David <0xC3><0x85>rmstrong's pitch and sent the flank player Gregory Henry (Gregor Sakuta Henry).
"Still Game" star seems to plan a new career in restaurant business
The comedy series "Still Game" star Ford Kierann (Ford Kieran), seems to be planning to engage in the hospitality business, as it turns out that he is named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he plays with his old partner in the comedy Greg Hemphill.
The Duet has announced that the next ninth season will be the finale of the show, and Kirnan apparently plans his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kirnan planned to engage in Glazgov's "floating restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us!": inland Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
The Marines patrol around their fleets in Lapa<0xC5><0x9F>a.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
Fleet base ships from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are smashed with a motto: "We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The memory of Chile in the bloody 19th-century conflict over the lost coastline is still alive in drought Bolivia, just as it has long been sailing back into the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations are probably the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is developing, in its spirit is united and peaceful and, of course, with positive thoughts awaiting the outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivarians watch the judgments of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia’s demand that, after decades of interrupted negotiations, Chile should discuss sovereignty over sovereignty.
Bolivia’s charismatic local President Evo Morales, who is awaiting a controversial re-election fight next year, is also very interested in Monday’s verdict.
"We're close to recovering the Pacific Ocean," he said in an enthusiasm at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that a court ruling in favour of Bolivia is unlikely and, if adopted, a major change is not expected.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory, and its representatives have stated that it will not determine the outcome of the possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is adopted by no one six months after the final examination shows that the case was "not complicated", explained international regulatory expert Paz Zarate (Paz Zárate) from Chile.
And in the last four years, the Bolivian case has not been moving forward, but, on the contrary, has been delayed.
"The question of access to the sea has been raised by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
The military rhetoric of Morales in the Chileans has suffocated the remainder of the goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations once, but after that it will be very difficult to hold a discussion.
Both countries have not exchanged envoys since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, did not agree that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an “emergency opportunity to start a new era in its relations with Chile” and an opportunity “to put an end to the 139-year-long conflicts that will result from both sides,” he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Moraless, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used sea problems as political crusaders.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to figure out what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will only give up nuclear weapons if it can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said that his people would never be the first to eliminate their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Mr Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the pledges made during the meeting of the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
Her comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to resume the diplomatic measures to prevent the nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with the North Korean leader.
Ri argues that it is "fantasy" to hope that the U.S. still does not lift sanctions and does not want to declare the end of the Korean War, will ever let North Korea take its way.
Washington has been cautious about agreeing to the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are skeptical about whether Phenjana really wants to give up the weapon, which the state certainly considers to be the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phoenix next month to prepare for Kim's next meeting with Trump.
Paris fashion show introduces the latest massive main street line on the way to your nearest High Street
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown (Thom Browne) introduced viewers with a row of absurd, huge on a head-wearing item in the 2019 spring/summer season collection that sparked on the backdrop of the Paris Fashion Week style.
Highly impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their stunning achievements to showcase fashion.
Valentine’s greatest performance was a beautiful sandy hat decorated with color-like wide edges that apriry the head.
In the middle of the massive accessories were found gemstones, magic hats and even pineapple — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Browns also showed a strange mask selection — just before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had bleached lips, and they were used by Hanibal Lecter rather than by high fashion.
One of the forms reminded of breathing for swallowing, with tubular and glasses, while the other resembled a scented cone of ice cream.
And if you want to continue with massive fashion, then the right time has come.
Style viewers believe that huge canvases may be on the way to your nearest High Street.
Large-sized hats immediately became popular after the appearance of "La Bomba" — salmon hats with two feet (<0x7E>60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn everything from Rianna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The very impractical status of hats as a cult object on all social networks leads to another great legacy on the tongue — a sausage beach bag, almost as large as a model in a swimsuit that wears it.
The red-yellow rafting bag, decorated with rafting bars and equipped with a white leather handle, took a special place in the "Jacquemus' La Riviera" collection of the spring/summer season 2019 in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage explained to FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in the central business street stores next summer, because the designer has left such a big impression of the stylist that the impressions of the mile will be ignored.
John Edvards: Knowledge of languages is essential for the citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools have a reputation for excellent educational institutions, and it has retained them in 2018, when the results of excellent exams were obtained, further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art music and other societies.
This school, which has a total of 30,000 pupils in Scotland and is represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aims to ensure the best level for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their pupils for further and higher education, for their chosen career and for their lives as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can develop and implement specific school programs, we see that modern languages are still a popular and preferred subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, it will remain in his consciousness.
If you speak in his native language, it will remain in his heart."
This is a convincing reminder that we cannot simply rely on the English language when we want to build relationships and gain people's trust from other countries.
Given the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table with the highest number of exams completed in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages reached the highest score A.
Data from the Scottish Independent Schools Council on 74 schools show that 72 percent of students achieved the highest score A in Chinese, and the same score was also achieved by 72 percent who learned German, 69 percent who learned French and 63 percent who learned French and 63 percent who spoke French.
This shows that the support of independent schools in Scotland for foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed for children and young people in the future.
Languages, as a subject of choice, are now valued as high in the programs of independent schools as the subjects of the group of science-technology-engineering and mathematics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of employers mentioned a lack of language skills as a reason for failing to fill vacancies.
Therefore, more and more language skills become mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
By increasing job opportunities where language skills will be needed, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, by learning a foreign language, they will gain the real advantage in the future, which is provided by such a long-term skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of multilingual practitioners.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain conversations, but French was the only one with a two-digit population of 15 percent.
That is why the contribution to language learning is important for today’s children.
Multilingual skills, in particular in the languages of developing countries, will give children a better opportunity for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in terms of the taught languages.
Some schools will focus more on the most common modern languages, while others will learn languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered to be the most important for the future of the UK, according to plans by 2020.
Whatever your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be specialists in the area concerned.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a linguistic environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed in the future.
At present, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital to the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages would be considered to be the "skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish young people this choice, diversity and excellence.
It has to be done (it has to be done).
John Edwards is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
Lebron debuts in "Lakers" on Sunday Sandjego
Fans are finally looking forward to the moment when Lebron's first game in Los Angeles's Lakers will take place.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season Sunday against Denver's "Nuggets" Sandjego.
However, it is still necessary to decide exactly how many minutes he will play.
"It'll be more than one, but less than 48," Walton told Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell (Mike Trudels) tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
Continuing the practice started this week, James asked about his plans for the Lakers six pre-season game series.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump myth in West Virginia runs time, channel YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a series of myths in Willing, West Virginia today.
This is the first of Trump's five planned fairs next week, including stopping in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his choice to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump's goal is to gain support in the upcoming interim elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress after voting in November.
What will the Trump myth take place today in West Virginia and how will it be viewed online?
Trampoline in Vilnius, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m., after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump myth in West Virginia on the online YouTube channel.
It is thought that Trump is talking about this week's hearing in the case of Supreme Court candidate Breta Caveno, who has been charged with sexual offences, and the Senate's vote is expected to postpone the approval to the week's trial while investigating the FI.
However, the main goal of this myth is to help improve the situation of Republicans who are expected to be elected in November.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign shows that the task of this next week’s five myths is to “activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will visit as much as possible as we are starting a working campaign season," Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to reveal his name, told Reuters.
This evening’s myth, which is scheduled for the Westbank Arena in Willing, will likely attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and it will be reflected in the Pittsburgh media,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump will visit West Virginia, a state in which he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia senator Patrick Morrisey, a candidate who is behind the scenes.
"It's not a good sign for Morris that the president should come in to help improve his survey results," Simon Haeder, professor of political science at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Raider Cup 2018: The U.S. has demonstrated its determination to fight to keep high hopes for Sunday singles
After three sessions "in one word" Wednesday afternoon in the "foursome" format of the game was probably exactly what was needed for this Raider attack.
Athletes love to talk about the fluctuations of success, and they really believe it, especially in races like this.
So, which side do they think is luck now?
"They were in the lead with six points, but now with four, because I think it means in a way that success is aimed at us," said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, of course, has an advantage because it is in the 4-point lead, but 12 more will be played.
Spitz explained that Americans believe that the wind blows in their veins and they have a reason for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spitz and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can be proud of three out of four points.
The sprite has been destroyed from the first place of the site to the grass, and is an example of a winner.
These guttular victory calls became more and more loud as his round continued, a decisive sit-in was made in the bid to reach four times the same number of sit-ins when he and Thomas had been postponed by two sit-ins after two.
Her site in the fraud that succeeded her victory 15 , was caught with a similar name, from them, for her conviction that the American team has not yet been excluded.
"You really have to go deep, and you have to worry about your game," Spit said.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 tricks to get success.
The only players who have scored more points over the past two days than Spitz and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Raider Cup.
The European strange but attractive couple is left behind by four points and will not be able to hurt.
Molyvud was the only couple to have no bows on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bows on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at nine in the last beatings on Friday morning.
This rush and the way their energy flows into this troubling effort and back convinces them that they are the players to win on Sunday, and Flittwood with Molinari will be the most popular players who can ensure a potential European victory when the sun sets on the National Golf.
We both want to do different things at the same time.
However, talks about the European triumph were premature.
Babba Watts (Bubba Watson) and Webb Simpson (Webb Simpson) were quick to deal with this morning's four-ball hero Sergio Garcia (Sergio Garcia), who played alongside Alex Noren (Alex Noren).
Bogie and the two doubles in the front nine brought the Spaniards and the Swedes into the chest, and they weren't even close to getting rid of it.
But there is no one on Sunday that will help you get rid of it.
Games in the "fourball" and "foursome" formats are so exciting to watch closely because of the interaction of pairs, watching what tips they give and which ones don't, and how strategy can change the situation instantly.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and before the last few days is in remote control, but this race in the foursome format showed that the US team is determined to fight for what many, especially the Stateside, have doubted.
European selection on the last day of the Raiders Cup is in the lead 10-6
The final day of the Raiders Cup will begin in favourable leadership after Saturday's "fourball" and "foursome" races ended in the lead by 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were led by two victories over the hard-working Tiger Woods, which increased the score of Le Golf National to four.
Thomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) the European team to keep the trophy lost by the Hazeltine two years ago dominated the inaccurate American team in the morning races in the four-ball format, and the result of the series was 3-1.
The U.S. more vigorously opposed the foursome format, winning two matches, but unable to eliminate the deficit.
The team of Jim Furyk needs 8 points on Sunday in 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Flittwood is the first European debuter to score four points in a row with Mollinary, called Molliwood ("Molliwood") after a sensational week's draw is just the second pair of Raiders' Cup history to score four points in the first four games.
I would like to congratulate Vuds and Patrick Reed in the "fourballs" format, then without difficulty in the glorious game they broke the tired Vuds and American newcomer Braison Dechambo (Bryson Dechambeau) with an even more impressive score of 5&4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, played a great game for a while, but he has lost 19 of the 29 games in fourballs and foursomes formats, plus seven in a row.
Justin Rose (Justin Rose) rested before the game of fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson (Henrik Stenson) "foursomes" to communicate with 2&1 Dastin Johnson (Dustin Johnson) and Brooks Kepku (Brooks Köepka) and Brooks Koepka (Brooks Koepka).
Europe failed to fully achieve its own, although the day in the south-west of Paris was pleasant and a slight wind blowing.
The three-time winner of the most prestigious golf competition, Jordan Spitz and Justin Thomas, set a benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They printed 2&1 against Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs format and returned later to connect Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 "foursomes" after bedtime.
Just twice in the history of the Raider Cup, the team has played a 4-point deficit in a single game, but, as the owners, the Farika (Furyk) team is enough with only an indistinguishable result to keep the trophy.
After being in the second place for two days, as it seems, the Sunday counterattack will be problematic.
North Korea announced that in "nothing" will disarm unilaterally, without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister on Saturday informed the United Nations that the continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States, and that in such a situation, North Korea would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho informed the annual General Assembly of the world organization that North Korea has taken "significant goodwill steps" last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile attempts, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the democracies.
"However, we do not see an appropriate U.S. response," he said.
“If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in the security of our country, and under these circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean remarks about Washington’s opposition to a “stage” approach to denuclearisation, according to which Korea will be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement left an impression as a result, since it did not automatically denote it.
Mr Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chennai and Donald Trump at a meeting of US President-North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work to achieve "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged to secure Ziememek.
North Korea has attempted to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that the United States must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also failed to uphold the call to ease the serious international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States insists that 'denuclearisation must be first', and raises the level of pressure created by sanctions to achieve the goal of power, even in opposition to the 'declaration of war ending'," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions could push us on the roads is empty fantasies that people who don't know about us do.
But the problem is that continuing the sanctions only deepens our distrust."
Mr Ri did not talk about his intentions for Kim's second meeting with Trump, whom the US leader had specifically mentioned during a speech at the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the minister highlighted three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the other side of this denuclearisation issue were South Korea, not the US, the Korean peninsula would not be denuclearized."
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed dramatically from last year's when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the launch of North Korea's missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after Mr. Trump's "left president" was called "Mississippi" by Mr. Trump.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still much to be done, and sanctions must be kept in place until the winter.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not planned a specific time, stressing that "it doesn't matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should be rewarded for what they have done.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously, without making mistakes, until final and convincing denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions since 2006 in an effort to achieve a tightening of funding for the nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes of the Peninsula.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the meetings of the UN General Assembly, and then informed him that he would visit again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not been successful.
He withdrew from Phoenix in July, saying that progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea accused him of "gangster-worthy demands".
North Korea's meeting with Mun this month pledged to dismantle the weapons pole and also the nuclear complex if the U.S. takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" that North Korea wants to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard University will learn the subject of how to relax enough
A new subject at Harvard University this year has succeeded in getting students to sleep more, and it is an attempt to address the increasingly popular culture of brutalism, which includes caffeine-filled study overnight.
One teacher discovered that the world’s best university students often don’t even have a foundation on how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a subject of study, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
The inspiration for creating a new subject for learning came to him after speaking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the day, a girl came to me and asked, 'Why do you tell me this only now that I'm in the last class?'
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her how important sleep is — which surprised me, he told "Telegraph".
This year’s first-ever course provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to achievements in learning and sports, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and the University’s Executive Director of Health Services, said the university decided to introduce a course of study after learning that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week of study.
During the hour-long training process, interactive series of tasks are included.
One of the parts is a picture of the accommodation door, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports is affected by lack of sleep and how important it is to sleep.
In the other part, students are informed about how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the student city map with interactive icons invites participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how health will be affected by smoking cigarettes," added Professor Chaisler.
He said that the culture in which he prides himself on the ability to learn all night still exists, and added that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that enough quality sleep to ensure is a student's "blind weapon" to combat stress, excess and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, because the lack of sleep in the brain switches to hunger mode, making their hunger stand out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop a subject after attending one of the professor’s lectures last year, Harvard’s first course.
He said that the subject of study has opened his eyes and inspired to make the course accessible to the entire student city.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for students who obtain a postgraduate education to acquire a similar program before going to enjoy the competition.
Professor Chaisler advises students to install an alarm not only for the time they get up, but also when they go to bed, as well as to keep in mind how people are harmed by "blue light" emitted by electronic devices screens and LED lamps, as they can be confused by day, night driving.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Menga's gates occupy the Jerarda virus
The Rangers went to another sad game in the guests when Dolly Menga's site Steven Gerrard (Steve Gerrard's confused team) made a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The Ibrox team hoped to get the first win in the outing since February 4: 1 triumphed on St Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt gave Gerard his second loss in 18 games, since he has become the manager of the club, and his team is located in the <0xC4><0x8C>eko in the S<0xC4><0x8D>ekarta.
Menga put the ball in the goal seven minutes before the half-time end, and the lack of inspiration for the Rangers did not look at anything after trying to level the result.
The Rangers drop to sixth place, while the Livingston climbs to third place, and in terms of the goal difference, only the Hibernian surpasses it.
And the "Rangers" may have another problem, because the judge's assistant Calum Spence needed medical help because of the head trauma, which was apparently caused by the far end of the burning object.
Jerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left behind the Ayr when he reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same "Livingston" 11 players who took the "Hearts" one point in the previous week, and he would be happy as his well-drawn team squeezes opponents in each episode.
It is possible that the Rangers managed the ball more often, but the Livingston used better what was their behavior.
They were supposed to get the goal two minutes after the start of Menga's first game sent Scott Pittman towards Alan McGregor's goal, but the center player missed his big opportunity.
Then the far-flung K<0xC4><0xAB>n<0xC4><0x81>n Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was able to send the ball only to the far-flung rear squad.
If you are a member of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of the Board of Directors of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of Directors of the Board of the Board of the Directors of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board
Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) undoubtedly considered that he had to make a penalty in the 15th minute after he had met Steven Lawless (Steve Lawless), but Judge Steven Thomson (Steve Thomson) rejected it.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly) was not particularly disturbed, nor Lassana Coulibaly (Lassana Coulibaly) with a head, not a modest Ovi Ed<0xC5><0xBE>aria (Ovie Ejaria).
Even though the start of Livingston in the 34th minute may have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they already deserved it for their efforts.
The Rangers were once again unable to cope with Jacob’s long-term combination.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher broadcast the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the balance and chose Meng for a simple finish.
Jerrard Kulibali was replaced with Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately affected the game, as the half-guard sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly from his line immediately blocked the ball.
But "Livingston" continued to make guests play as they like, with Litgov and Halket doing one-of-a-kind site after the other.
The Holt team could have continued to lead in the final stage, but McGregor played well by stopping Jacobs before Litgov made a head-on turn.
Rangers deputy Glenn Middleton later demanded another penalty spot in the game after colliding with Jacobs, but Tomson's request was ignored again.
Almanah: The inventor of Geiger's counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanaha: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geigers, who grew up as a physicist, was born.
Geigers developed a method for determining and measuring radioactivity, which ultimately resulted in a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which took and retained its place in science, has also taken its place in pop culture, such as the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" (Coronado Calls), in which the main roles were played by externally unconvincing warriors and rogue fighters.
Man: "What, at the iodine, is that?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headsets, you will be able to hear how the atoms are excreting because of the radioactivity generated by this mineral."
Evans: "Really, it's really a bird!"
Hans Geigers died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention named in his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and kill them
As part of vaccine therapy, the immune system is taught to recognize malignant cells
When using this method, immune system cells are obtained from the patient, which are transformed into a laboratory
Then they will be able to "see" the protein, which is characteristic of many malignant tumors, and will be injected back into the body
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of malignant tumors.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize malignant cells experienced that her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves obtaining cells from the patient's immune system by transforming them in a laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2 characteristic of several tumors, and then inject these cells back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of malignant tumors," including breast, ovaries, lungs, and colon cancers, explained Professor Berzovsky.
A similar approach, when the patient obtains immune system cells that have been "invaded" how to attack malignant tumor cells, has worked in the case of one type of leukemia.
Kanje Vests after visiting the SNL, dressed in a MAGA hat, attacked Trump critics.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was featured in the Saturday Night Live show after an independent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for the 2020 presidential election.
Last night, the third song, titled "Ghost Town", during which he wore "Make America Great" hats, he began barking loud phrases about Democrats and re-emphasized his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to white people, they ask, 'How can you like Trump? He's racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, then America would have been a long time ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a parody with Meth Damon (Matt Damon) in the lead role, in which the Hollywood star cast a witness to Bret Kavanaugh (Brett Kavanaugh) in the Senate Committee on Justice for the indictment of Christian Blasey Ford (Christine Blasey Ford) for sexual assault.
Although it was not transmitted, the material was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock with Vesta’s pity.
It's unclear if Rocks tried to kill West like that.
And even the West regretted to the audience that he had been ill-treated in the back of his head because of his head.
"They laughed at me in the back!
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head!"
They laughed at me!
And yet they said that I've lost touch with reality," West said, according to the Washington Examiner.
The West went on, "It's hard to see what happens when you lose your connection to reality?", and promised to pull up your "Superman encampment" because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try out the love!"
"Variety" reported that her comments caused the spectators to sneeze at least twice, but the team members of the show looked confused, and at least one man told the press release: "The studio entered full silence."
The band was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande (Ariana Grande), who had died a few days ago by a friend of the rapper Mac Miller (Mac Miller).
The West confused many with the song (I Love It) he performed in a champagne bottle costume.
Vestu was supported by the leader of the Conservative group TPUSA, Kandace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the strongest people in the spirit: WE WILL LOOK UP!"
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "who he is, and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his 'art') who, in my opinion, supports and barks with an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before the show’s repertoire, Twitter announced that it had changed its name, saying that it has now become “a creature formerly known as the Kanji West”.
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts like Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was formerly Snoop Lion, and of course, the legendary musician Prince, changed his name to a symbol, but then to "a stage artist who was formerly known as Prince".
Indictment for attempted homicide in Belfast restaurant crash
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was found at a restaurant in Belfast East on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballihackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate’s court on Monday.
The prosecution will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
"Wizard Games" star Kits Heringtons turns against toxic masculinity
Kits Herington is known as the sword-cancerist John Snow in HBO's ruthless medieval fantasy series "Wizard Games".
However, the 31-year-old actor has turned against the stereotype of the brutal hero, stating that such characters on the screen often make young boys think that they need to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kits explained that he thought it was "a problem", and asked the question of how to cope with toxic maritality in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kits, who recently married his "Through Game" partner Rose Leslie (Rose Leslie), also 31 years old, acknowledged that this problem is important to him.
"I can't even think about what mistakes we've made with masculinity at the moment," he said.
"What do we teach young men about this aspect of the problem when they grow up, given the problem that exists?"
Kits believes that television with its very masculine characters may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued, "Who is born, but who is being taught?
What is being taught on TV and the streets that makes young boys feel that they need to be like men?
In my opinion, this is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change it?
Because there are obviously problems with the young men."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he will not participate in any of the "Third Games" sequel or event, after the series ends next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and horses are crowded".
Starting with November Kits will play the main role in the renewed Sam Shepard "True West", which is the story of the film producer and his brother a thief.
The actor recently admitted that he considers his encounter with his wife Rosa the best thing that happened to him as a result of "Three Games".
"I met my wife on this show because in a way it provided my last family and my life since then," he said.
Rose Emmy Award-winning fantasy series played by Other character John Snova's beloved Igriti.
The couple broke up in June 2018, owned by the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China said that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased rapidly by 14%.
Healthcare officials report that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were a result of sex, which indicates changes.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission as a result of sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is said to be common.
Given the state’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of sexually transmitted diseases are not sufficiently protected as a result of sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged to provide general access to HIV medicines as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxine Voters denies that an employee has stolen data from Republican senators, targeting "dangerous lies" and "devotional theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. House of Representatives (Maxine Waters) denied allegations that her staff member has posted personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia’s lawmakers pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the allegations were circulated by the "ultra-left" whistleblowers and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more cute lies," said Voters on Twitter.
It is reported that the stolen information includes addresses and telephone numbers belonging to U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orin Hech (Orrin Hatch) from Jutah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, it was published by an unknown Congressman, during a hearing in the Senate group on Breta Caveno's charges of sexually degrading behavior.
The escape occurred some time after three senators had evicted Cavena.
Conservative, internet sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the record is associated with the Voters cabinet, and revealed information about Voters staff, Hills reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false and completely false!" said Waters.
“My staff, whose identity, personal information and security is compromised because of this fraudulent and false claim, is in no way responsible for the leakage of information.
This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false and completely false!"
Voters’ statement soon sparked online criticism, including criticism of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleisher wrote.
"This allows us to conclude that her temperament does not match the member of Congress.
When a person is accused of what he has not done, that person must not be angry.
He must not be wary.
He must not speak of the motives of the defendant.
He has to be peaceful and courteous."
Fleisher’s task was to compare Waters’ reaction to the fall of a Democrat for Judge Caveno, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who runs to get Voters to lose seats in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Voters informed that her cabinet had warned the responsible officials and law enforcement bodies of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the culprits will be found," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their works that are destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
"Johnny Anglis 3" review — left halfway through Rowan Atkinson's parody of spy movies
It has become customary to look for associations with Brexit in each new film with a British flavor, and this seems to also apply to the one who has resurrected, the Johnny English showcasing the adventures of a comedy franchise.
Is the dental satirism about ourselves, about how hopeless we are, a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Anglim, with his naked eyes and an unusually moving face, has the right to create a rabbit after the second revival — his name more than anything else signals that he has a wide-spectrum committee character in the wrist, not in the back of the wrist.
He, of course, is this stupid secret agent who, despite his odd claims for fascinating exquisiteness, is a little quiet, a little Mr. Bean, and a little salty in the eyes of his guy who plays one episode of "Chariots of Fire" in the 2012 London ceremonies.
He is also based on a traveler and an international, incomprehensible character that Atkinson once portrayed in Barclaycard TV ads, where he left chaos on his way.
In the recent experience of Johnny England, there are at least one or two pleasant moments.
I liked the place where Johnny Anglis goes on a helicopter dressed in a medieval gun suit, and the blades of the propeller for a moment flash against his helmet.
Atkinson's ability to visually create a comic impression is well visible, but humor is quite weak and oddly superficial, especially because of the "serious" film brands like "007" and "impossible mission" self-confidently using comedy as a stand-alone.
Humor creates the impression that it is dedicated to children rather than adults, and I don't think Johnny England's absurd lizards are as creative and targeted as Atkinson's mother-of-pearl tricks on Bin's skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that the UK has become a serious mess.
The cyber-hacker has infiltrated the UK’s super-spy internet network, uncovering the identity of all UK agents in this area, as an untrustworthy active agent — the unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last psalm for the prime minister, for the pompous and conflicting person, who has already lost completely political popularity: Emma Tomson does what she can with a character that resembles Teresa May, but the script doesn’t have much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform that, since all active spies have been made public, she will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this man is the inexperienced Johnny Anglis, who is now working as a teacher at a subtle educational institution, and taught obedients how to work as a secret agent (a fun joke), as Anglis offers to learn the profession of skepticism from the very foundations.
The coal is brought back to Vaithol for an emergency meeting and is merged with his once-dead assistant Bo, also played this time by Ben Millers (Ben Miller).
Bo is now married to a husband, married to an underwater commander, a fun character who only becomes important at the end of the film — a role in which Vicki Pepperdine (Vicki Pepperdine) is not fully used.
And so Batman and Robin made a huge mistake in serving in the secret service of Her Majesty has returned and met the beautiful fateful woman Ophelia Lodi (Ophelia Bulletova) depicted by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime ministers are dangerously trained by the charismatic billionaire of technology, the evil Jason Volta, depicted by Jack Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve the UK's computer lock.
Angles and Bo begin their wild odyssey of fun: masked as officers, they ignite a fine French restaurant; they create a conspiracy secretly entering the luxury yacht of Volta; and Angles causes absolute chaos, attempting to use the interplays of Volleyball, virtual displeasure.
All possible endings are done, but no matter how attractive and funny the film is, it contains a lot of children's television elements.
Lots of moderate elements.
As with other Johnny English films, I can't imagine if the British film industry could give Rowan Atkinson a role that would make full use of his talent.

Jeremy Corbyn (Jeremy Corbyn) The Labour Party is about to discuss a radical plan according to which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants the leaders of the companies to allocate the savings of the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers, giving them another holiday.
In such a case, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend, at the same time receiving as much pay as before.
Sources say that the idea will "respond" to the party's agenda in the economy, and plans to change the economy for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which considers it an opportunity for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior representative of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that changes in policy will be announced by the end of this year.
"It won't happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an idea that matches the party's goal of balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's overall strategy in industry."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week already in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Party of Labour, as such, does not support these hungers at the moment.
A representative of the Labour Party informed: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy, and the party does not consider it."
Shadow Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used a lecturer's conference last week to give a glimpse of his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr Macdonald explained that he was committed to taking power from the "mass of directors" and from the "speculator" of public service companies.
The shadow cabinet minister also plans that existing average shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover all their packages, because the liberal government could implement "deduction" due to the injustice allowed.
He also approved plans to include employees on boards of companies and to set up exclusive Ownership Funds to give 10% of the private-sector company capital to employees who receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 each year in dividends.
Lindsay Grem and John Kennedy answer "60 Minutes" whether the FIB investigation into the Caveno case could change their view
The FBI’s investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question of whether the office’s findings could put a Republican senator to revoke.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FIB could uncover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy left a more open human impression than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," replied Kennedy.
"I said, speaking to the hearing procedure, I said that I spoke to Judge Cavena.
I called him after it happened, when the charge became known, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, direct and unambiguous."
After all, Grema's vote is obviously stoned.
"I have made a decision about Bret Caven, and it will take a grueling charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know, look what: Brets strongly denied it," Grems added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her nominees were able to confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there's any change to be expected."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to alleviate poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: to reduce poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens’ Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will gather in the Central Park of the Greater Mauritius not only to enjoy performances, such as the event of Jennifer Jackson, but the repertoires of Cardi B (Cardi B) and Izzy Mendess (Shawn Mendess).
The "Global Citizen Festival", launched in 2012, is an event created by the international defence group "Global Poverty Project", which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless there was a desire to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert attendees had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as doing a volunteer job, sending an e-mail message to a leader of the world.
But how successful has been the Global Citizen movement, whose goal is still 12 years to achieve?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a good way to convince people to act, or is it just another case of so-called "clactivism" when people think they can really influence what they can do by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizen movement claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters in an effort to achieve various objectives.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion and that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities for which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that the funds allocated to date have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" — a partnership of UK-based investors and executives committed to "help children grow up to full value" by promising to provide Rwanda with <0x24>35 million in US dollars to help end the nation's inadequate jackpots in Twitter.
"With the support of the UK governments, donors, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can leave the history of inadequate social injustice in the history of nutrition," said Tresey Ulmeman, a spokesperson for The Power of Nutrition at a concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also noted that following the launch of more than 5,000 measures, calling on the UK government to provide better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will feed 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen commented: "It will be a long and long journey where we will fall for moments and suffer failures.
However, as has been achieved by the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will also be successful, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Deborah-Lee Furness.
U.S. could use war fleet "blockade" to delay Russian energy exports, says interior minister
"If necessary," Washington may use its war fleet to deter Russia's energy market, including in the Middle East, said U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s activity in Syria, especially in the areas where it operates under a legitimate government invitation, is a pretext for new energy markets to be explored.
"I think the reason why it is located in the Middle East is because it wants to supply energy the same way it does in Eastern Europe - in the South of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, through its war fleet, can ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot bring its energy into the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the audience who had come to visit the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself the "power consumer voice" of the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to addressing the situation in Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
"The economic potential of Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a country whose economy is mainly dependent on fossil fuels.
There are claims that the Trump administration is promoting LNG exports to Europe, thereby replacing Russia – the much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trump administration officials as well as US President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince Germany to step down from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project that would make Berlin "dependent" on Moscow, according to Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the capacity of the existing gas to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's burning resistance project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," he said after a meeting in Moscow in September with U.S. Energy Minister Riku Periyya.
The US has expressed its negative attitude towards Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would feel a big problem if a third country interfered in our energy supply," said Dythers Kemps, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider his candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she was seriously considering running for president after midterm elections.
During the House sitting in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for presidential election.
"It's the right time to have women in Washington who are "supposing" the incomplete government, which also means women-presidents," she said in The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will carefully consider my candidacy for the US presidential election."
During the House session, Warren referred to President Donald Trump, claiming that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his nominee of the Supreme Court, Breta Caveno.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: "Of course, the FIB needs an investigation before the election."
However, a survey published on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s supporters do not think she should run for the 2020 election.
According to the Boston Globe poll by the Center for Political Studies at Sufolk University, 58 percent of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not run for the election.
Thirty-two percent supported this decision.
The results of the survey revealed that more support was received by former Governor Deval Patrick, receiving 38 per cent for candidacy in the elections and 48 per cent against.
Also in connection with the possible candidacy in the 2020 elections, such high-profile Democratic Party officials as former Vice President Joe Baiden and Vermont Senator Barney Sanders appear.
The Associated Press news agency reported that Baidens is committed to making an official decision by January.
Sarah Mirror quotes Treka Mirror PTSS Donald Trump's Medal
Trek Peilins, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being summoned to the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, which he is going through after his return, I can refer to other families facing the consequences of PTSD and a certain dose of vulnerability that our soldiers are returning to," she told the public at Donald Trump's Oklahoma State University in Tulsa.
In a statement, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a resolution on the need to ensure that the European Parliament and the Council's Member States are aware of the need to ensure that the European Parliament and the Council adopt and adopt measures in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (EU) and the Council (EU) 2015/1397.
According to Dena Beneta, representative of the Vasila Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women and possession of weapons in a state of need.
18 states, District of Colombia presents a challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that prevents refugee victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the region of Columbia on Friday in Washington presented a brief statement to a court advisor to support asylum seekers facing the obstacles posed by the policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace v. Sessions case initiated by the American Citizens' Union against federal policy in August is not disclosed.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of her violent gangmate" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grey described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large proportion of U.S. asylum seekers come, as countries where the problem is widespread gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigrant Appeal Board to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racin, said on Friday that the new policy "ignores the laws of the state, federal and international law imposed by the decade".
"Federal law provides that all asylum applications are considered on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the relevant claim, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the court adviser said in a brief statement.
In addition, the lawyer stated in his statement that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering the country is damaging to the U.S. economy because these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions addressed immigration justices with a request to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuses.
"Resistance is available to people who leave their country because of persecution or fears related to their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Seshons said in a statement on 11 June regarding politics.
Revolt has never been designed to address all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, the number of casualties doubled in the search for survivors
The situation of the survivors became more and more difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusuma, calming his feverish little one at the center of evacuation in the city of Palu.
"In a few minutes, the emergency medical service introduces new victims.
Clean water is a deficiency."
The inhabitants were visible as they returned to their destroyed homes and overlapping the water-borne treasures, trying to save everything that was found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that had been affected by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken spine and shoulder, were lying outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were taken care of outside due to heavy sleepless after-hours.
She tears in her eyes, remembering how a powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
It seems that I was pushed through the walls," Harris told the Associated Press news agency, stating that his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I called my wife for help, but then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of attempted harassment by using propaganda advertisements
A week after the official Chinese newspaper came out with a four-page long ad, every day highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S. and China trade, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press props.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid annex to the China Daily in the state’s best-selling newspaper Des Moines Register, accusing China of attempting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, but leaving China.
Trump's allegation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a new stage in Washington's growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently experiencing a growing trade war, as a result of which they apply a number of tariffs to each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's repressive tariffs were targeted against exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-time governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstads wrote his opinion for the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, claiming that China "is now doubling this threat by placing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the freedom of speech and free press tradition of so important to America by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register," Branstads wrote.
"However, here in the usual Beijing news kiosk you will find a limited amount of divergent views and you will not see such divergent views a true reflection of what the Chinese people may have in common with the Chinese concerned party," says the Chinese concerned, in the disturbing economic trajectory.
He noted that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans to detach women's electorate from midterm elections involving the Caveno scandal
As many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, against whom a number of allegations of sexual violence have been raised, analysts have warned that in the upcoming midterm elections they will not be able to meet women.
The emotions associated with it have been extremely high, and we can see that the majority of Republicans were already ready to give up their voices.
Such cases cannot be revoked, "in the Saturday paper "The Hill" reported by Professor of Political Science Grant Reeher at the University of Syracuse at Maxwell School.
Richards doubts that the last-minute encouragement of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct a FIB investigation will be a reason enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or November," according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, Karine Jean-Pierre said on Friday — the senior adviser to the progressive movement "MoveOn".
On Friday morning, protesters in the front of the Senate sang "November is coming!" demonstratively, when the Republicans, under the control of the Committee of the Courts, chose to continue with Caveno's candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford's "Dr. Christine Blasey s".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news portal.
“People say it’s already at a high level, that’s right.
However, this could be even higher, especially between the volatile voters living in the suburbs and younger voters (aged 18 to 29), who often don't go to the polls even if the president doesn't like them."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she presented allegations of sexual violence on the part of a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts may fail if the Republicans continue to raise this nomination.
"The Republican Party has become a mess," according to NBC News at the beginning of last week, said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or about whether Caveno will be convicted, it's also about how the Republicans have solved this situation and how they have handled it," Guy Cecil told the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are a little divided about who to believe according to Ford and Cavena's testimony, a little more trying to believe the latter.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are certain or mostly inclined to believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say that they are certain or inclined to believe in Cavena’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Caveno may have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, FIB is currently investigating Ford’s allegations, as well as at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, following Fleek’s instigation.
Last week, Ford witnessed in the Senate Committee on Justice that Caveno, aged 17, was drunk on his sexual assault.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court’s position as a judge during his studies in Yemen in the 1980s showed her her her genitalia at a party.
Global Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Take Over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project "Inrupt" is a company based on the open-source platform "Solid".
"Solid" allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Kinderss-Lee jokes that the hidden intention of Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the new company.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses "Solid" technology so that people can create their own "personal online data repository" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
This is the same as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available simultaneously in one browser.
The online storage of personal data is unique in that only the user determines what and what type of information can be accessed.
The company calls it "personal powers through the use of data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea of "Inrupt" is to provide the company with the resources, processes and appropriate skills to make "Solid" available to everyone.
The company currently operates a security platform purchased by IBM, B<0xC3><0xA6>rnerss-Lee, Bruce, some external developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could develop their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Barnerss-Lee said he and his team weren’t talking to Facebook and Google about whether to implement complete changes, completely turning all of their business models overnight.
"We're not asking for his permission."
In an article published by the platform "Medium" on Saturday, Barnerss-Lee noted that the "mission" of "Inrupt" is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on a solid basis."
In 1994, Barnerss-Li transformed the Internet, forming a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Barnersam-Li has had an influential view in the debates on net neutrality.
Even after the Inrupt launch, Barnerss-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new webinar," said Mr. Barners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victorian Cross awarded to a Spiritualist during World War I
For 100 years in its hometown, there is an event when the only pastor of the Church of England received the Victorian Cross as a fighter during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vans received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper, so he did not recognize the highest British military award he received.
On a Saturday show in Rashden, Northamptonshire, her two little ones unveiled a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was "excellently symbolic" that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received a significant award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Wens led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through the very thick fog and the great fires caused by the vast expanse and logistics."
Later, he hurried to the shooting line and with the utmost security led that line forward before taking the big-town area, where he won three groups.
Venus was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 —just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Wens (72) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, and that at the same time is also very humble actions.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also blamed the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band for their debt.
Michael Vans claimed that he felt "proud to participate in this debt" and pointed out that "the true hero's value is evidenced by the support provided by many people."
MMA fans waited all night for "Bellator 206", but instead waited for Puppy Pep
Imagine that you spent the whole night on top to see "Bellator 206", but in the end, you are banned from watching this major event.
The San Jose poster included 13 battles, including six on the main map, which were broadcast live throughout the night on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Musasi (Gegard Mousasi) and Rory MacDonald (Rory MacDonald) were ready to stand against each other, the spectators in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised by the switching of the broadcast to Chicken Pep.
Some were truly misunderstood when they had been awake all night until early morning, awaiting the battle.
Some fans on Twitter described the change of broadcasting to a children’s cartoon as a “failed joke”.
"The government has determined that after 6:00 a.m., this type of content is unacceptable, so the transmission was switched to a children's programme," explained Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communications.
"Piece Pep," "yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said he would work on scheduling so that viewers in the UK could see these broadcasts in future.
"Thinking about retransmission, I think we can solve it somehow," said Cocker.
"But the clock is there at six in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a lot of text appeared after the broadcast switch, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that next time there will be no such problem.
We'll stick to five fights instead of six (as we've been so far). We tried to please the fans, but we made sure.
This is an unsuccessful situation."
"Desert Island Discs": Tom Daley didn't feel good enough because of his sexuality
Olympic Nigger Tom Daley claims that he grew up feeling less valuable than others because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started attending high school.
While on the first Radio 4 program "Desert Island Discs", led by Lorena Laverne, he mentioned that he started talking about gay rights to give others a "perspective".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less anxious about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent director of the long-term programme, has gone on vacation for several months due to the disease.
Turning out to be excluded from society in Laverne's first program, Daley said that growing up feels "less valuable" than others, because "the society does not accept that both girls and boys can be liked."
He said: “Until today I feel that I’m not as good as others, or that I’m different, has been the key driver that gave me strength and endurance to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that there is "something" to keep people from hoping when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-level LGBT campaign leader and has used his appearance at this year’s Friendship Games in Australia, calling for even more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak to the public because he felt happy that he was able to live openly and without complications, and wanted to give "perspective" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "surpassed the unprepared".
Daley was the 20-year-old winner of the Oscars last year, claiming that the age difference has never been an obstacle.
"When you went through so much at such a young age" (his first Olympics was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became an elder son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"The first year all that was important to me was getting a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? There's more important things in life than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robin."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley mentioned that his father did not want to accept that he died, and one of the last things he asked Dale was whether he had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, where he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that she's not going to be in the first row anymore," he said.
"I held his hand until the moment he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - getting in front of the home runners at the Olympics. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired her first choice of song — Heather Small performed "Proud", which resounded with her on her way to achievements in the Olympics and continues to cheer her up.
The programme "Desert Island Discs" will be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m. in British Summer Time.
What is the best way to do this is to make sure that you have the right to do it.
On Sunday, Phil Mickelson will set the record by playing his 47th Raider Cup game, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid the unsuccessful turn of events.
Mikelson, who already takes part in the championship for the 12th time every two years, captain Jim Furyk (Jim Furyk) was placed on a reserve bench on Saturday for four ball games and two pairs of games.
Instead of being in the center of action, as it has been so often in relation to US teams, the five-time winner spent his day as a supporter and as part of his game in the hopes of fixing what was behind him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the tense fight on the uneven Le Golf National, where inaccurate pitches are regularly penalized.
And if the game itself is not scary enough, Mikelson will fight the precise British open championship winner Francesco Molinari (Francesco Molinari), who has joined forces with the young Tommy Fl<0xC3><0xB8>tvud (Tom).
If the Americans, who are left behind by four points at the start of 12 single-player games, succeed in the lead, Mikelson's match could be crucial.
Furiks without words expressed confidence in his team member.
"He was fully aware of his role today, spread out on my back, applied his hand to me, and said that he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He's very confident of himself.
He is an excellent athlete who gave so much to these teams earlier and also this week.
Looks like I hadn't imagined him playing in two games.
I imagined more, but everything changed the way it did, and that's what we're going to do.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most played cats in the Raider Cup race on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Raider's Cup race career, which never really fell to his individual record highs.
Mikelson has won 18 wins, suffered 20 losses and seven indistinguishable games, although Furik claimed that his presence gave the team some intangible benefits.
"He's nice, sarcastic, and aspiring, he likes to be entertained by people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
“I think the youngest players also liked to cheer them up this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives much more than just a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) of the European selection knows that a significant lead can quickly be extinguished
Captain Thomas Bjorns from experience knows that a significant advance in leadership in the fight for the last days of the Raider Cup in a single game can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
Danis debuted in the 1997 games in Valderrama, where the team of opponents captained by Seve Ballesteros won a five-point over the Americans, but only now reached the finish line with a relatively small 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 point over 14<0xE2><0x81><0x84>31.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a significant lead in Valderrama; we had a lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only with a small overlap," said Bjorns in the golf course 10 (pictured), "in view of the National team's 5th and 6th round of the 2018 season".
So history will show both me and every member of her team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you will give everything back to yourself.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
It won’t end until the points you’ve gained are visible on the screen.
Our goal is to win this trophy and we will also focus on it.
“I’ve always said that I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very well aware of who on the other side stands against us – the world’s top players.”
Relieved about the performance shown by his players on the golf course, Bjorns commented: "I've never been happy about early.
There are new challenges ahead of us tomorrow.
Tomorrow is designed for individual games, and it is a completely different thing.
It is great if at times when everything is going well, you have a partner with you, but in individual games your golf skills are fully tested.
This message you have to give to your players, namely, that they in the next day in the game give back to themselves everything.
Now you leave your partner, and also he must go to show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's opponents, captain Jim Furick will look to his players to show their best performance directly in individual rather than partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth (Jordan Spieth) and Justin Thompson (Justin Thomas).
Furik himself has scored in both sides of these important last-day tournaments — both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later in the breakdown, when European teams achieved sensational success, which later became known in the world of golf as "Miracle at Medinah".
"Remembering each sentenced word," he said, in response to how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain of the team, unified his players for the final day of the fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get to the quick pickup you've had in Brooklyn, you've had in Medina.
When such an impulse is emitted in one direction, it creates a high pressure for mid-stage games.
We have created our own composition accordingly and scored the guys in the way we thought we were right. We will try to do some magic tomorrow."
Tomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack, and he entered Rory McIlroy (Rory McIlroy) for the main game and Europeans Paul Casey (Paul Casey), Justin Rose (Justin Rose), John Râmu (Jon Rahmoul) and Pohmoul (Jon Rahmoul) and Pohmoul (Tommy).
"I'm scoring the guys in that order because I think it's the best part of the tournament," Bjorns said of the selected single-player players.
Germany's new warship has again been postponed
The newest fleet of the German fleet was due to be put into service in 2014, thus replacing outdated Cold War warships, but it will not happen until at least next year due to the faulty system and rising costs, local media reported.
The transfer of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main vessel of the Baden-Württemberg frigate class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, reports the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a representative of the military sector.
The ship was due to join the carafle in 2014, but the unpleasant after-sales problems influenced the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is expected that they will be equipped with a powerful large-scale, a range of anti-air and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signal sensing.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods – the possibility to deploy new frigates for up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the continuous delay means that the state-of-the-art warships that would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in overseas countries will already be outdated by the time they come into service, notes Die Zeit.
The unsuccessful frigate F125 last year was noticeable in all headings when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the shipyard "Blohm & Voss" in Hamburg.
This was the first time the caraflotte returned it back to the shipyard after the ship was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for this step, but German media mentioned a number of significant "software and equipment defects" that would render the warship useless if it were used in a combat mission.
Software shortcomings were a particularly important factor, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships are operated by a large crew of about 120 sailors, which is only half of the staff of the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been found that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the carafle to make its improvements in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate ship is twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) has also become a major problem.
It is said that its costs have reached EUR 3.1 billion instead of EUR 2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly important, given the recent warnings that the German naval forces are declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, acknowledged that the caravan was indeed "beginning to miss a ship that could be used".
The official claimed that over time this problem has significantly worsened, because old ships are withdrawn from operation, but new ones are not delivered instead.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had joined the carafle.
"National Trust" hears the secret life of squirrels
The new study, which is being conducted in a Scottish highlands property, is aimed at discovering how straps use the landscape in the process of searching for food.
It is expected that the findings will introduce new clarity on this unique behaviour of flying mammals and will help them in their protection measures in the future.
Scientists from the National Trust in the Invereves gardens in Westeros will study red-haired couples, pygmy couples, as well as brown couples and water couples.
The main sites of the property will be located special recorders, which will track the activities of the ski swingers throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Sound experts will analyze all the records to determine the frequency of call of the bands and what species are carried out in the specific activities.
Then a biotopic map and a report will be developed to create a detailed landscape view that reflects the behaviour of the slopes.
NTS Nature Conservation Adviser Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are the most important for squirrels and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of biotopic management works such as the creation of grasslands and how best to preserve forests for swamps and other related species.
Over the past 100 years, the population of squirrels in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly.
These lands are under threat of construction and development work, which affects the loss of shelter and residence.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as moss paper and some building materials for chemical treatment, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, straps are not blind.
However, due to their naughty hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes during hunting.
They use a sophisticated support-location method to find insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the problem of slippery slopes very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, checks on ski slopes and sometimes even rescues.
The organisation has even established the first and only specially designed reserve of Threave in Scotland in Damfries and Galway, where eight out of ten species of squirrels are found in Scotland.
Property Manager David Thompson (David Thompson) claims that this area is ideal for strap-oners.
"Here's a great place for straps," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and generally suitable biotopes.
However, there are still a lot of things we don't know about the straps, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive."
He stresses that before carrying out the maintenance work of the property it is important to check whether the straps will stay in the appropriate place, because it may be possible that as a result of the unconscious destruction of the hideouts of one female, up to 400 females and their infants are killed.
The seals are protected animals and must not be killed, muttered, disturbed or destroyed in their hides.
An employee of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust (Elisabeth Ferrell) has called on the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about the straps, and for a number of species we simply don't know how to cover them."
Ronaldo rejects prosecution by appointing lawyers to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has been convicted of violating charges against him as "trustworthy news" by claiming that people "will pay attention to themselves" using his word.
Her lawyers have been appointed to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
The Portuguese and Turin Juventus football star is accused of raping Kathryn Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid the woman <0x24>375,000 to silence her about the incident, she told Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after these allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, via Instagram’s online video, addressed his 142 million followers, calling this information “trustworthy news”.
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they claimed today is fake news," said the five-year Ballon d'Or award winner in the chamber.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, it's part of my job.
I'm a happy person, and everything's fine," the player added, laughing.
According to information provided by Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations they have made of "unacceptable reporting on suspicion in the field of privacy".
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player will seek compensation for "moral damage to an extent that corresponds to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident occurred in June 2009 in the "suite" room of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted to the Nevada County Court of Appeals, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's hotel room after meeting the nightclub, where he had been sexually assaulted.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on the road and said he was "99 percent a good guy" but fell that "one percent" in the temptation.
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but this happened after a mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of the injuries she suffered at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she no longer wants to agree to the terms of this agreement because the incident left her injured.
When the claims were made, Ronaldo threatened to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer he moved for 100 million euros to the Italian grand Juventus.
Brexit: the UK's 'forever regrettable' loss of car manufacturers
"The United Kingdom will regret it forever if, after Brexit, it loses its position as the world's leader in car manufacturing," said Greg Clark, the secretary of business.
They are "concerned" by the fact that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Klarka.
The Japanese automaker said that delays to the borders in the case of Brexit could put the game on the job without an agreement.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the other Member States of the European Union.
"I think that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about exiting the EU without a contract and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexit, it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month.
According to the automakers, the main concern is the endangered supply chain if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the principle of "study in time", where cars manufactured by order arrive every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK withdraws from the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be disturbances at the border, which could lead to some delays and delays.
According to the company, "Toyota" would not be able to detain more than one day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so it would come to stop production.
Mr Klarka said that the Chequers withdrawal plan for future relations with the EU was "exactly calculated in order to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best deal that would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit at the moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4 on the program "Today".
"The application for this, not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we must be able to fully pursue a very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota was unable to say how long production could be halted, but warned that rising costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness in the long run and ultimately put jobs at risk.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and working at the factory as the coordinator of the union merger, said that his members are feeling more and more anxious: "I can say from experience that once a job disappears, it doesn't come back."
The Government spokesman said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rozenstein could be postponed again, reports the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as the fight against Supreme Court candidate Breta Caveno continues, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rozenstein is supervised by Special Adviser Robert Miller (Robert Mueller), who investigates the interference in the Russian elections, the link between Trump's funds and Russia, as well as the possible disregard for the rule of law by the president.
For months, Washington has been questioning whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and thus threaten Miller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the recording of the talks with Trump and the possibility of postponing the president by amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, where he talked about his resignation.
Instead, a Thursday meeting was announced with Trump, who was at the time at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Trump said it was "best" to dismiss Rozenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Courts Committee hearing in which both Caveno and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct—Dr. For B.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FIB to conduct a week-long investigation into Caveno's allegations of delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rozenstein meeting, she replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been postponed, it could be this week or a week later, taking into account all the cases that are happening around the Supreme Court.
But this is what we will see, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters dispute this claim: Sanders has not organised a White House press release since September 10.
The leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of bribery was not associated with disrespect for the television reporter's "famous kari", although she added: "I do not deny the fact that they are famous kari."
She then proposed a direct contact between Tramp as a result of increased interest in the press.
"The president will engage in more questions and answers than any president before him," she claimed, and without giving any further information, commented: "We are interested in the number of them."
Sanders claimed that the release will still take place, but, "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions to the President of the United States without delay, it is undoubtedly better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this a lot, and you see that we have done it a lot over the last few weeks, and it will happen at the press release site when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences attended by important people.
Individual press conferences are rarely held.
Probably, the President demonstrated his reasons this week in New York, using an uncontrollable and momentary expression of the reporter's efforts.
Minister of Health writes to EU employees of the Scottish NHS on fears related to Brexit
The Minister of Health has written off EU staff working for the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude and wish for endurance after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Frimena wrote: "Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued during the summer on the resignation that led to the decisions to be taken this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario if no agreement is reached.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
Therefore, I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the involvement of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from both the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service and benefit our cared for patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we would very much like to stay here."
After a head injury, Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery.
In Tennessee, the defender of the state "Tigers" Christian Abercrombie (Christion Abercrombie) underwent an emergency operation after a head injury, which he won in a game on Saturday, which resulted in 31-27 matches "Vanderbilt Commodores".
The head coach of the Tennessee state team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the trauma was not long before.
"He got to the side line and it said it crashed," Ryds said.
While Abercrombie was on the sideline, coaches and medical staff gave him oxygen, then put it on the nests and brought him to a further investigation.
A state official in Tennessee told WSMV reporter Chris Harris that Abercrombie had been isolated from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that, for the time being, "there is no information about the type/peasure of the trauma", and the Tennessee state team is trying to figure out when the trauma occurred.
Butcrombie, a representative of the red shirt, is in his first season after Illinois replaced the state team in Tennessee.
Before Saturday's loss, he had done a total of five blocks, which totaled 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher state fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Overseas buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when purchasing property in the UK, and the additional funds received will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory plan.
Such a step will neutralize Korbin's efforts to attract new voters.
Increased taxation will be applied to non-taxable persons in the United Kingdom.
The State Treasury estimates that up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year can be collected, which can be transferred to help the homeless.
Overseas buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom and transferring the additional funds obtained to help homeless people, Teresa May will announce today.
This step is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract new voters with promises to provide housing at cheaper prices and by speaking out to the most prosperous part of society.
Increased state taxation will be applied to non-taxable individuals and businesses in the United Kingdom, allocating additional money to government efforts to address the problem of homeless people.
The premium included in the current state fee, including the application of a higher level of fee imposed two years ago for the purchase and lease of another home, could be up to three per cent.
The State Treasury expects that such a step can supplement its budget up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London’s newly built properties are purchased by non-residents, thereby raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get to their home.
Many rich country territories, especially in the capital, have become "spoke cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced just weeks after Boris Johnson (Boris Johnson) called for a reduction in the state tax so that more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by confiscating the land, but not using it, and encouraged Mrs. Meja to give up quotas for affordable housing in order to deal with British housing.
Mr Korbin has proposed a number of attractive housing reforms, including a reform of rent control and housing decommissioning for no reason.
He also wants to give the councils more power for the construction of new housing.
Mrs. Maya said: "Last year I mentioned that I will use my position as Prime Minister to restore Britain's dream of a better quality of life for every new generation.
And that means organizing our inexpensive housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and arrange their lives here.
However, it is not right that housing can be bought as easily as foreign companies and people who do not live in the UK, its hard-working people in the UK.
For many, the dream of their home has become too far away, and the problem of the harsh homeless is still up to date."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's boss Jack Ross claims that his biggest goal is at some point to become a Scotland's leader.
Scots, 42, has accepted the challenge of restoring the Northeastern club, which is currently taking third place in the first league with three points from the top.
This year, he moved to the Stadium of Light after the relegation of St Mirren to Scotland's premiere last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got the B Cup, and that was all," Scottish BBC broadcaster Sportsound told Ross.
"But I grew up with my dad watching the game 'Scotland' at Hampden Park, and it has always invited me back.
However, such an opportunity would only appear if I were successful in managing the club."
Rosa's predecessors at Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Alardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keulo, Guss Poiets, and Paul Poyets.
The former Alloa Athletic boss claims that he was not alarmed by following such a great club’s recognised leader in the footsteps of rejecting the offers made by Barnsley and Ipswich in advance.
“My successes will now be assessed by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
This is the first time I have ever heard of the fact that I am not the only one who has the right to know.
“Returning to the Premier League will not be an easy task, but I will most likely think that I will only be successful here when this task is accomplished.”
Ross is only in the third year of his managerial career, acting for some time as a deputy director in Dumbarton and spending a 15-month period in the team of Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa to recover from falling to third level and in the same season helped St Mirren to win the championship.
Ross claims that he now feels much more comfortable than his player's career at clubs "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"They were probably the real crossroads," he recalls, taking responsibility for "Alloa".
"I really believed that leadership was my real call — much more appropriate than playing.
It sounds odd, because I had good success, I could live from it and also enjoy certain heights.
However, playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but management is my field.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it. It's just that I'm in the right place, I haven't felt so good all my life."

The summer heatwave has made Britain’s less popular bars shrink, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data collected revealed that in July sales of bars and bars had increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, who represents the business consulting agency CGA, which collected the data, said: "Continuous sunny weather and England's prolonged participation in the World Cup competition meant that in July there would be a similar trend as in July, in the fall of June, the 2% of the population was left on the brink.
Restaurants, whose sales declined by 1.8 percent in June, experienced an even worse situation in July.
The situation in beverage bars and bars was the most grateful, as they experienced much higher ups than restaurants experienced downs.
Food-based bars are also hardened by the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant staff did.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Drinks in bars and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by 3 per cent."
RSM Recreation and Hospitality Analyst Paul Newman said: "These results continue the trend at the end of April.
Temporary conditions and the influence of broad social or sporting events are the major factors that determine turnover outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to fight, although a fall in sales of 4.8 per cent compared to the relevant period of the previous year will be particularly painful to the additional constant cost pressure.
With regard to food suppliers in the long and hot summer could not have arrived at the most inappropriate time, and the weather will show whether the moderate temperatures that we normally experience in August will provide such a much-needed shelter."
The total increase in sales between shops and restaurants, including new companies, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a decrease in the sales volume of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK’s sales supervisor for the bars, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data from the 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, which is an integrated industry criterion.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that it hides from its parents.
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some only 11 years old, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
In a survey of 20,000 high school students, an increase in fake Instagram pages was discovered.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of sexually explicit content.
Twenty percent of students said that they have a "main" account to show to parents.
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
In a survey of 20,000 high school students, it was found that Instagram’s photo sharing site is rapidly increasing the number of fake profiles.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of sexually explicit content.
Twenty percent of students stated that they have a "clean main" account to show to their parents, as well as private accounts.
One mother, who sneered at her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site, discovered a teenage girl who encouraged others to rape her.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Leaders Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-old students had two profiles, and only half of them admitted to holding private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s scary that so many teens are creating online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eil<0xC4><0xAB>da Doila will be the "easy voice" in the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish High Athletics Board at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors without executive powers.
Doila is Scotland’s most award-winning space and outdoor lighthouse, and President Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for those who are driven by sports to use their extensive experience in the international stage.
"Eilid is given a huge honour throughout the Scottish, UK and global lightweight community, and we are confident that Scotland will gain an enormous amount of lightweight by engaging in their board of directors," said Bithys.
Doyle said: "I would like to act as an 'easy voice' and hope that I can really get involved and help drive this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m run at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, thus earning four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular BBC pandit, was unable to follow a transitional ischemic stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "On this day a month ago I experienced a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors claimed that only time will show whether and to what extent I will recover.
It was a terrible job, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again and I can already do fitness training today!
Thank you for the inspiring words!"
Opinions share about breast milk pump ads that compare mothers with cows
The breast milk pump manufacturing company has taken care of the shared opinions online in connection with advertising in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to cow scraping.
In order to mark the release of the so-called "world's first silent breast pump", the consumer technology company "Elvie" releases a sticky diaper advertisement to demonstrate the freedom of breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers danced with a wall-filled cow’s cake at the song, the words of which sounds like, “Yes, I’m squeezing myself, but you don’t see any ass” and “if you haven’t noticed, they’re not rocks, they’re my breasts.”
The plea goes on: "Sweep, sweep, I feed the babies, sweep, sweep, I nurse my ladies."
However, the advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page has invoked a wide resonance online.
77,000 times viewed and hundreds of times commented on the video has received shared spectator reviews, and many claim that it highlights in the light of the dairy industry's "shocks".
"Very wrong decision to use cows for product advertising.
Just like us, they, too, have to become difficult to produce milk and become fertilized, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after they are born," someone wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk pump does not fall into the breast of breastfeeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use it to advertise breast milk pumps for mothers who can keep their babies?"
There was also an opinion: "Advertisers didn't know what they were doing."
Others defended the ad, and some woman admitted that, according to him, the song was "annoying".
"I think that's a great idea.
I would buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
The milking made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little tricky, but I understand its idea.
This is a genius product," he wrote.
Another comment states: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who refuse milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like "gods".
It is not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the ad, a group of women discover that they all danced with the unstoppable pumps placed in their chests.
The campaign concept is based on the observation that many women who refuse milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the "Elvie Pump" pump is completely silent, it has no wires and pipes, and it inadvertently fits into the breast for breastfeeding women, allowing them to move freely, keep babies and even participate in events outside the home.
Anna Balarina (Anna Balarin) "Mother" partner and creative director commented: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between women who refuse milk and dairy cows, we wanted to focus our attention on milk rejection, while demonstrating in a entertaining and comprehensible way the thrilling sense of freedom that the new pump will bring."
This is not the first time that the "Elvie pump" pump has arrived at the center of attention.
In London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the tongue of Marta Jakubovska (Marta Jakubowski) while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent town on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased rapidly, although relatively as many people cross the border each month, and this has been partly achieved by the harsh rhetoric and policy implemented by the Trump administration, which has made it difficult for children to stay at the shelter.
In general, the majority of sponsors were also immigrants without documents themselves, fearing that openly calling for a child would jeopardize their chances of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their households would have to be allowed to remove their fingerprints, and this data will also be passed on to other authorities related to immigration.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement officer, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of uncharted minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had not been previously convicted.
"Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or members of sponsored households stay here illegally, and a large proportion of these people are criminal aliens.
That is why we continue to harass such people," said Mr Albensa.
According to the asylum worker, in an effort to deal with cases of children faster, officials have introduced new rules, which provide that some of them will have to come to court within a month of detention rather than 60 days as envisaged by the previous standard.
Many will use the videoconferencing call option instead of coming in person to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons who will be deemed not to be eligible for exemption will be promptly expelled.
The longer children are held in detention, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or attempted escape, is reported according to the information and testimony provided by asylum workers during the last month.
Lawyers argued that these concerns will be exacerbated in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering are more often ignored because of their breadth.
They added that moving children to a tent town without spending enough time preparing them emotionally or allowing them to say goodbye to friends could lead to trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish "occupied armies" to immediately withdraw their troops
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in Syria is already in its eighth year.
Moualems, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are illegally located in Syria, defending the fight against terrorism, and "this will be dealt with appropriately".
"They must resign immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualems insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes, "the war on terrorism is almost over".
He said Damascus will continue to "fight in the Holy War until all Syrian territories are cleared", cleaned from both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1000 men to this war-torn country.
With regard to the refugee issue, Mualems stated that the conditions were great for them to return, and blamed "separate Western countries" for the "proliferation of irrational fears" as a result of which the refugees do not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive state-renewal aid until an agreement on ending the war between Assad and the opposition is reached.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone based on the last dumpster in Idlib has created an opportunity to facilitate political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualems stressed that the agreement was "definitely deadlines", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda-linked group "Jabhat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene new committees, including government and opposition representatives, the first meetings to develop a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualems set out the conditions for the participation of the State of Syria in the committee, stressing that the work of the group would be limited to "revising the articles of the existing constitution" and warned of interference.
Why will Trump be elected for a second term?
From this point of view, Mr Trump will be re-elected to the 2020 elections, unless, and perhaps, many liberal observers hope, the impeachment and the scandal prematurely add points to his Presidency.
And in that case, "this will be the most dramatic finale of the presidency of all time!"
There is currently no evidence of the relaxation of the spectators.
Since 2014, the ratings for CNN’s most favorable broadcast time have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million viewers, but MSNBC has almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million viewers.
FOX NEWS is the world’s fastest-growing broadcaster, with 2.4 million viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen reports, while MSNBC “The Rachel Maddow Show” is in the top spot with over 3 million TV channels.
"It's a fire that attracts a lot of people, because it's an incomprehensible thing for us," explained Neal Baer, the ABC drama's "Designated Survivor" backing. In this drama, he tells about a ministerial cabinet secretary, who becomes president.
Nell Scovell, the comedy writer and "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" has its own theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that I would vote for Mr. Trump.
She wanted to know — why.
"He replied, 'Because he's laughing at me,'" said Mrs. Skovel.
Chaos is, to some extent, entertaining.
Of course, unlike everything else that is seen on TV, news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Rou v Veid judgment, whether immigrant families will be able to unite, and the global economic situation.
Ignorance is a greed that can only be tolerated by the most privileged observers.
And yet it’s more than being informed by a citizen when it’s six o’clock to watch an expert group discuss how Bob Woodward has used unnamed information sources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s “Happiness,” Paul Manafort’s “Happiness,” and Daniel’s “Happiness,” “Happiness,” “Happiness,” and <0x24>15,000 bums.

When I met Mr. Fleiss for a week, the time in Kauai on the North Coast was sunny, 80 degrees (<0x7E>27 degrees Celsius), but he sat in the rooms, where he watched the MSNBC broadcast, at the same time.
He was unable to stay, even when Brett Kavanaugh had to appear before the Senate Committee on Justice and his future in the Supreme Court was threatened.
"I remember the time when we made all those crap shows and when people said, 'This is the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from abroad flows into the campaigns for the fastest interim parliamentary elections
It is no wonder that the Pennsylvania 17th Congressional Election Area is aiming to receive money thanks to the transformation of the Congressional Area, which will result in two current Members fighting for one seat.
This newly transformed nomadic district of Pittsburgh is linked to the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who took his seat in a special election in another district in the spring of last year.
Lembs will fight another existing MP, Republican Kait Rothfus (Keith Rothfus), who now represents a former Pennsylvania 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old areas were unconstitutionally distributed for the benefit of Republicans, the maps were revised.
Competition in the new 17th district has led to fighting between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lembs became known in Pennsylvania when he won with a small overwhelming victory in the widely observed March elections in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district.
Republicans held this position for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won in this area by 20 points.
Political experts provide a small overlap for the Democrats.
U.S. considers Salvador’s punishment for China’s support, but then considers
Diplomats have acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and he stayed at the hotel in Panama until his partner knocked out the Trump organization’s management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of the "recent decision not to recognise Taiwan", its department's representative, Heather Nauert, said in a statement.
However, penalties were considered to apply only to El Salvador, which received approximately 140 million dollars from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include the reduction of financial assistance and the restriction of targeted visas, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and murder rates have reached the highest levels.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic well-being and which would have followed a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as a rapprochement effort to prevent U.S. migration.
In mid-September, senior officials of the country made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially ending the comments to punish El Salvador.
Diplomats reported that Vice President Mike Pence has now decided to attend the conference scheduled for mid-October to show how serious the administration is stressing the meeting.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and serious announcements or sanctions on the part of Washington.
The White House representative, speaking on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not want to provide further information on the debates described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss in-house talks if their anonymity was maintained.
What he said was confirmed by an external analyst who approached the administration, who also spoke on condition that his anonymity would be preserved.
Study of the history
The second stone in the garden could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Miller (Robert Mueller) that Mr Trump may have delayed justice, which has a lot of evidence at the disposal of the public.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If another party in Congress succeeds, Trump will have to respond to this body, and perhaps also to the jury of his peers, right at the time when he is already about to meet with the voters again.
There is a lot of 'but', and I do not say that the fall of Trump is inevitable or that it will happen to his fellow Europeans.
There are choices that we will all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to turn against Hitler if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We are exhausted and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of prolonged blood alcohol.
History revolves around such turning points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now have to face a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rozen<0xC5><0xA1>tein has had a difficult time since it was reported that last year he proposed to secretly record talks with the president and thought about his inadequacy for the position.
Mr. Rozenstein argues that the story of The Times is not accurate.
"How do we respond if the FIB investigation just requested of Bret Caveno is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed as a Supreme Court judge despite his unworthy testimony and credible allegations of sexual assault?
And most importantly, will we vote for Congress, which will call Trump to account, the interim election?
If we don't stop all these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
However, I believe that everything will work out for us with reference to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by exactly the same Nazi regime that once starved at my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to put the Sabbath candles on the table with a swastika.

"Rangers" star Grem Dorans (Graham Dorrans) feels optimistic about the battle with Vienna's "Rapid"
The Rangers will take Vienna's Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after the impressive indistinguishable game in Spain with the Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the European League Group G.
The road injury prevented attacker Grem Dorans from re-entering the season's matches until the indistinguishable result by 2:2 with Villardarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about it because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old footballer.
"We went to the game believing that we could make a good success, and we won this point.
We may have been able to beat them in the end, but the overall outcome is honest.
They may have been better in the first half, but we got out in the second half and we were a better team.
And Thursday will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it won’t be an easy game, because they got good results in the previous game, but I’m confident that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and get good results.
Last year with all my traumas and changes at the club itself, it was clearly difficult, but now I can see new stories that I feel good about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we can continue the fight, leave the season behind and achieve success."
Women can't sleep because they're worried about their pension reserves
While the respondents clearly knew what kind of care they wanted, there were few who had discussed the matter with family members.
Approximately half of people in a country-wide study said they did not talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent answered that they had talked about it with their children.
"People want their family members to take care of them, but they don't do anything to pronounce it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the State Life Insurance Agency.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse's friend and your children. You can't prepare your family for the fact that you will need care if you don't make your wishes known already well in advance.
Work with your consultant and family to say where and how to receive care, because these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor. Your advisor can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your options to provide long-term care financing can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with a sum of money to cover these costs, or insurance by using your property — the main thing is that you have the money.
Develop your own legal documents. Prevent legal disputes even before they have started.
Discuss the health issues of the authorized person so that you can be a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that specialists will act according to your wishes if you are unable to express them in your own strength.
Consider also the possibility of granting a financial mandate.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of paying your bills if you are unable to do so on your own.

Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
According to the government, the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday have killed at least 384 people, and the death toll is expected to increase.
Because of the lost communications, rescuers have been unable to obtain any information from the Dongala area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of a strong earthquake of 7.5 magnitudes.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palu after a devastating natural disaster.
Here is the basic information about Palu and Dongal, located on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the narrow end of the bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. It is estimated that in 2017 it lived 379,800 people.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami broke out.
Dongala is an area stretching about 300 km (180 mi) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
It is estimated that in 2017, 299,200 people lived in the area, which is an administrative region of the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the economic backing of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal Dongala area.
Nickel production also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali (Morovali), Sulawesi on the opposite coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Palu and Dongal have been victims of the tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in the Dongal.
Tsunami also gasped across the western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific fire ring, where earthquakes are regularly formed.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nia, on the shores of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the most populous islands in the south of Java, Indonesia, causing a tsunami on the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake erupted near the city of Padang — the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai on the shores of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height that devastated dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: an earthquake near the surface hit the Pidi Jaya area of Aceh, causing damage and panic as it reminded of the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people were killed in damaged buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok (Lombok), killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake smashed thousands of buildings, and temporarily forced hundreds of tourists to return home.
Sarah Peelin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Peilin, has been arrested for being charged with the attack.
According to a report from Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Peilins, who lives in Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and opposition to arrest.
According to a police report, when a female coroner tried to call the police to report, as she claimed, the crimes that occurred, he picked up her phone.
Pailin has been detained at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention facility, and he has been charged with a security fee of <0x24>500, reports KTUU.
He went to court on Saturday, where, when asked whether he was guilty, he declared that he was "certainly not guilty".
Pailin has been charged with three A-Class offences, for which he can be sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He is also charged with a B-class offence, for which he can be sentenced to a day's imprisonment and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time that charges have been filed against Pailin in criminal proceedings.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Pailin.
Her mother, Sarah Spiegel, called the police and reported that the attack had taken place.
This case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, with a report of domestic violence being delayed and with carrying a weapon in a state of need in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims that he slammed him in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Peilina for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome when he returned from service in Iraq.
Earthquake caused by tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been destroyed and the number of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake erupted near the central part of Sulawesi, southeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are distributed on social networks, where you can see the moment of collision.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami struck the shore.
Federal prosecutors want to demand a rarely used death sentence for a person suspected of a terrorist act in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Saifullo Saipov (Sayfullo Saipov), who is held on suspicion of a terrorist act in New York City when eight people were killed. This is a rare form of punishment that is in the state for federal crimes.
As claimed, 30-year-old Saipov used a Home Depot rental car to carry out an attack on a motorcycle in October along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he spotted pedestrians and pedestrians on his way.
In order to justify the execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious injuries, as mentioned in the statement of intent to demand the death penalty filed in New York City.
According to the court document, both of these charges can be sentenced to death.
Within weeks of the attack, the Federal Grand Jury accepted an indictment paper on Saipova’s prosecution in 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the purpose of extortion, usually used by federal prosecutors in the case of motor traffic offences and in the case of organised crime.
The attack required "significant planning and prior intention," the prosecutors explained, saying that the attack carried out by Saipova was "extraordinary, ruthless and inhumane".
"Saifullo Habibulaevi<0xC4><0x8D>s Saipov (Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov) reportedly wounded, damaged and caused losses to the families and friends of these people: Diego Enrique Angelini (Diego Enrique Angelini), Nikolas Kl<0xC4><0x81>vs (Darz<0xC4><0x81>ngo<0xC4><0x81>n), Nikolas (Darz<0xC4><0x81>ngo<0xC4><0x81>n), (Nicholas-D<0xC4><0x81>r<0xC4><0x81>r<0xC4><0x81>r<0xC4><0x81>r<0xC4><0x81>r<0xC4><0x81>r<0xC4><0x81>n-D<0xC4><0x81>r<0xC4><0x81>r<0xC4><0x81>n)," (D<0xC4><0x81>r<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4><0xC4>
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since prosecutors in New York City’s South District Court filed an indictment in a case where the death penalty can be imposed.
The accused Kalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The last execution in New York’s federal case was executed in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who was sentenced to death after being charged with spying for the Soviet Union during the first two years of the war.
The death penalty for a couple of Rosenbergs in an electric chair was executed on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, for days and months, Saipovs, born in Uzbekistan, did not show regret for the attack.
According to the police, he informed the investigators that he was feeling good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipovs told officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS video on his phone.
The police have also informed him that he has also requested permission to put the ISIS flag in his chamber.
He has rejected 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said he was "stupidly naturally dissatisfied" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty rather than accept the recognition of guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only extend to all parties involved in the ongoing injury," Patton said.
The Saipova defense team has previously called on prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MEPs say Brexit negotiations should be entrusted to NAIDJEL FARAJA
Naidel Fara<0xC5><0xBE> promised to "mobilize the army of the people" at a conservative conference during the protest.
A former leader of the UK’s Independent Party said that politicians should feel the anger of the Eurosceptics when one of the MEPs suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Conservative Party member Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that Britain would have long been resigned if Mr. Farah had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge that Ms. Maya will have to face in trying to unite her opposition party was demonstrated by conservatives who supported leaving the EU and joined a separate city protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his compromise plan for the future relations between the UK and the European Union (Chequers compromise) and to feel the attacks of those who want to leave the EU, those who want to stay in the EU, and also of the EU itself.
The co-conspirators insisted that she would be determined to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and that it would allow the Eurosceptics and liberals to choose between her offer and "chaos".
Mr. Bouna, "Leave Means Leave" at a meeting in Solihull, announced that he would like to throw the Mean Plan in the fertilizer (the Chuck Chequers).
He proposed to make the Lord of the Pharisees a companion and to entrust him with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been at the saying, we would have already come out," Bouns said.
A Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I am in favour of Brexit, but we have to fertilize the Mesa Plan!"
While justifying his opposition to the EU, he said: "We didn't fight to be hedgehogs!
We want to adopt our laws in our country!"
Mr Bouna ignored the assumptions that public opinion could have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is absolutely false."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins also participated in March, and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the public.
"The Chequers plan is not popular, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters who actually do all the work and vote for us.
Please turn away from the Chequers and start listening."
In a statement addressed to May, she added: "The Prime Ministers remain in their place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians in the rally should feel pressure if they are not going to comply with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us - the people - and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to hand over Brexit and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let them do that."
In his message, he complements the passionate effort of the people: "I want you to let our politicians, who are planning to hand over Brexit, feel pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country who allowed us to win the battle for Brexit, and we will never save it until we achieve that we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the Palices walked through Birmingham before a two-hour fairy tale took place in the city center.
Unknown activists welcomed the Conservatives against the Brexit banners after the group's noon meeting this week.
Workers' Party representative Lords Adonis spoke to the Conservatives about the security issues they experienced at the start of the party's application conference.
"These are the people who claim to us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all their technology for Canada and yet, and yet, inseparably, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"This is an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to carefully consider running for president of the United States
Elections. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that she is "carefully considering" her nomination for the US presidential election after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future in the West Massachusetts city.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, participates in re-election in November and runs for GOP state Republican Geofu Dil, who was vice-president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that she will be the main one who will be forced to run for Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon event Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters using the city's motto since Trump took office.
A visitor asked her if she was planning to run for presidential election.
What Warren replied was that it was time for "women to be in Washington, D.C., who are "supposing" an incomplete government, which also means women-presidents."
In relation to the shooting of LSU basketball player Simsa is arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday that the suspected person was arrested on Friday in the case of LSU basketball player Way Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Daiteons Simpsons, 20 years old, was arrested at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they broadcast a video of the shooting, calling for help in the video's visible recognition of the man.
The Sims (20) was smashed and killed near the University of the South student city on Friday morning.
"The Sims were shot in the head as a result of his immediate death," police chief Murphy J. Pols told the press on Saturday, via 247 Sports.
A way to defend his friend in the bullet and the Simpsons shot him.
Simpson was questioned, and he admitted to being at the scene of the accident with a gun, and also admitted to having encountered the Way Sims.
Simpson was arrested without opposition and he is in the East Baton Rouge village police station.
The 6-foot 6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and played 17.4 minutes on average, earning 5.6 points and battling 2.9 deferred balls in the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship title after the team allows him to defeat Sebastian Fetelu
From the moment Valteri Bottas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton became clear that the Mercedes team's work will play an important role in the race.
From the start, Bottas started well and almost left Hamilton dry, defending his place on the first two trips and calling on Fetelu to attack his teammate.
Fetels first entered the garage and left Hamilton in the engines to deal with the others, this was probably decisive.
The Mercedes driver filled the circuit later and retreated from Fetel, but Hamilton continued to lead after a power match, which saw Ferrari drivers relentlessly leave the inside free, risking to retreat after a double maneuver to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and at the end of the first round was the seventh on his 21st birthday.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the race because he focused on tyres to quickly reach the finish and spot Kimi Raikkonen in the fourth.
After all, he reached the 44th round in the garage, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds, as Raikonens remained fourth.
This is a tough day because Walter did a fantastic job for the whole weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job of getting one to two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
On Saturday, President Donald Trump joked Senator Diana Feinstein for her unforgivable refusal to disclose a letter from Christian Blaise Ford in which she accused Supreme Court candidate Breta Caveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate Legal Commission, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people there were "bad, unreasonable and unreliable."
"One thing that can happen and something beautiful is already happening in the last few days in the Senate, when there is anger, when you see angry, evil, unlucky and untrustworthy people," he said.
"When you read the press releases and the information was stolen and then they say, 'Oh, no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
- Memories?
Diane Feinstein, did you get the information?
Remember her answer to the question...have you stolen the document? — "Oh, ok, what have I done?"
Oh, no.
I didn't do that."
All right, wait a minute.
If we did it...No, we didn’t,” he added, in the Senate’s innation.
In July, a letter was sent to Feinstein explaining in detail what Ford is accusing Cavena, and in early September the contents of the letter was released, but Feinstein denied that it would have happened in her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I "needed" her story," Feinstein told the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did as well."
But her refusal did not displease the President, who commented on the situation on Saturday night as follows: "I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, whose three women are accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own benefit.
"They are deliberately in a mood to regain power by any means."
Whether you see evil, coincidence, they don't care what they hurt, what they have to destroy in order to gain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyers throws two goals at the Giants right in the game against Dundee
The Dundee Stars played on Friday's loss to the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's answer with 5:3 Dundee.
The Giants gained an early preponderance when Patrick Dwyers and Francis Bovilliers scored the goal.
Mike Salivans and Jordan Kovnys led the housekeepers before Dwayne restored the Giants overwhelmingly.
French Buhards scored in Dundee before two words by Lucas Lundvald Nilsen secured the team’s victory.
This was the third loss in the Elite League this season for Adam Cafes boys who won Dundee by 2 to 1.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, in which the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer discovered the game's score in the fourth minute, at 3:35 when he received a draw from Kendall McFull, and David Rutherford doubled the score four minutes later.
After the start of the tense game, Salivan entered the home runners in the game at 13:10 before Mets Markwards joined Kovni to get the goal and level the score at 15:16.
Duvayers made sure that the Giants regained control at the first edition when he scored his second goal in the game this evening under the first period.
The home team regrouped and the Buhards again achieved a matching result with the goal scored in the force technique in the game at 27:37 minutes.
Kovnij and Charles Korkoran teamed up to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time during the end of the second half of the game, and he also won a convincing goal in the final period to lead his team to victory.
The Giants, who have lost four of the five games, will play the next game on Friday, where they will meet at home with Milton Keynes.
Air Traffic Controller Dies Allowing Hundreds of People On Airplane to Be Saved During an Earthquake
Some air traffic controller in Indonesia is portrayed as a hero after he sprayed himself so that the plane with hundreds of passengers safely lifted from the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a powerful earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The territory will continue strongly after-hours and many are trapped in the doubles in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues saved his life, 21-year-old Antonius Ganavans Agungs refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport control tower, which whispered loudly.
He remained in his position to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would safely take off in the air.
Afterwards, he jumped out of the traffic control tower, thinking that it could collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesian air navigation, Johannes Sirayts, said his decision could save hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC news reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to deliver it to the largest hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are heartbroken to hear it," he added.
Meanwhile, public authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands, the national disaster prevention agency claims that access to Dongala, Sigi and Butangao (Boutong) is restricted.
"It is expected to grow beautifully, because many more people's bodies are under the mines, and many are not accessible," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, which reach a height of 6 meters, destroyed Palu, where a mass grave will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to provide assistance and the necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "In just a few minutes, the emergency medical service introduces new victims.
Clean water is a deficiency.
Small shops are crowded everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, International Red Cross leader in Indonesia, told CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what we will find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can all get worse."
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu and the national military spokesman said: "I ask you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
This year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Airplane disaster in Micronesia: Now "Air Niugini"says that one of the people is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline carried out a flight during which the plane landed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people has been missing, although previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated from the crashing plane.
Air Niugini announced in a press release on Saturday afternoon when they could not answer for one of the passengers — the man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests to provide more detailed information about passengers, such as their age and nationality.
The locals helped by boats to rescue other passengers and crew after the plane landed in the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The causes of the accident and the sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft was loaded in the lagoon shortly after taking off the runway.
Some eyewitnesses seemed to have overestimated the length of the runway.
Bill Janes, an American passenger, said the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the wreckage using an emergency exit, because the water was only up to the middle.
He said that the stutterer fell in panic and screamed, as well as that he had a mild head injury.
U.S. Navy sailors who worked close to improving the shipyard also helped rescue by using a floating boat to bring people to shore before the plane crashed about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airlines over the last twenty years, none associated with "Air Niugini".
Psychoanalysis commentator explains the course of events on the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday provided evidence in the case, where a man is charged with burning a living woman in 2014.
The US Department of Judicial Expertise psychoanalysis commentator Paul Rovlet testified for several hours as a witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the defendants how he used the information he received from the phone to compile together how the 29-year-old accused Quinton Telis and the 19-year-old inmate Jessica Chambers acted the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several phones indicating that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, arguing his previous testimony, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers while he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford on Saturday at the courtroom testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Telis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "sad because my car was in Neshville."
Another disagreement was that Telis said that Chambers himself only about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rovlet said that shortly after Chambers' death, Telis erased the text messages, calls and contact information received from Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," said Heils.
It is expected that the defences will provide their concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jurors later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is a Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative opinions about this genre of music, with its music giving a positive message.
"The High Breed", from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has shifted from its predecessors to political messages and those when addressing social issues.
The group wants to return to the roots of the genre and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like "The Fugees" and "Common" have experienced a recent rebirth in the UK with such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
Black again?!
In New York, the niece sued the couple for dismissal after receiving "racist" news
In New York, the aunt sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an erroneously sent message from a mother who complained that the aunt was "black again."
The couple denies being racist by comparing the court case to the "oppression".
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her refusal to accept that the new babysitter, Jezel Maurice, was black when she arrived at work on the first day in 2016.
"IN THE NEEDS, ATKAL MELNAIS," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a message.
However, she sent a message, not to her husband, but to Maurice, in addition, twice.
Cutting her inactivity, the "samulsusi" remission of the Plasco-Flaxman to Maurice, indicating that her former high schoolmate, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and that she had been expecting the Filipinos, referring to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her one working day and sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice has sued the couple in court, requesting compensation for dismissal and wants to receive <0x24>350 a day for six months for work with secured living, which she originally applied for, in addition to no employment contract.
"I want to show them that they don't do things like that," she told The Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejects allegations that they are racists, claiming that Mauritius's job interruption was a sensible decision, because they feared that after her insult they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her what she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco, the husband, said to the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was just a mistake?
Your youthful spirit?
Think about it."
When comparing the court hearing to "printing", Plasko said that his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a very "complicated situation".
"Are you really looking at something like this?
It is not acceptable to act," added the investment banker.
While the proceedings are still taking place, public opinions quickly cross the courts on social networks, denying them for their behavior and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that Paddington’s book publishers were worried that readers would not be able to associate with a talking elephant
Bonda's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was confirmed, said of the letter: "It is difficult to "put yourself in some shoes" who read the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very surprising now to know what we know about Paddington's great achievements."
Saying that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before feeling inspired to write a book for children about a small toy lace, was optimistic that her work would be rejected. She added that in the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book.
Speaking of Paddington, which she calls a "very important family member", her father was silently proud of her potential successes.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and was not great," she said.
"But because Paddington was so right for him, it was like having a child who achieves something: you're proud even if you didn't do it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all the merits to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter by phone
After landing, her daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors were constantly fighting for her life.
"Ned called on a regular basis and said it was very bad and expected that she would not survive," said Ednana-Laperuza.
"Then I got a call from Ned saying that she's going to die within the next two minutes and I have to leave her.
And so did I.
I said, "That's right, I love you very much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors gave her to maintain the heart rate slowly ceased and left her body.
She would have died even faster, and it's all over now.
I had to sit down and wait for it to happen.
I couldn’t win or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and people around.
I needed a lot of strength to get through."
After all, then the lamenting loss of the daughter, Ednana-Laperusa boarded a plane with other passengers who had no idea who she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I shook my head down and the tears ran all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but right on the flight I felt deep sympathy for Neda.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him.”
Silent women attach cards to the bridges to prevent suicides
Two women, whose loved ones have committed suicide, act to help others not to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfrid fasten cards at the Welsh Bridge with inspiring message and phone numbers so people can call and get support.
Dai's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to live what I do every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in London, said her son was a promising cook with a addictive smile.
"Everyone recognizes him by a smile.
Everyone always said that her smile "lightened" always and everywhere."
However, he quit his job before he died, because he was "very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there will be consequences."
Davis created cards, "to make it known that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don’t have to sit still, you have to talk.”
Hamfrie, who has been Dave’s girlfriend for years, lost Mark, her husband, for 15 years, not long after her mother’s death.
"He didn't say that you'd feel sad or that you'd be depressed or that you'd feel anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning — when the children opened the gifts he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that."
Her death was a great trauma for children, but they have to deal with it: "This brings the whole family to life.
It separates us.
But we all have to go on and fight."

The future of Breta Caveno is in the air as FBI launches an investigation
"I think if we could really get what he asks for — in a limited investigation in terms of time and volume — we might be able to reach a little consensus," Fleiks said on Saturday, adding that he was worried that the committee would "participate."
Why don't Caveno and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their abstinence is only coercion.
After five weeks, on 6 November — if Republicans are expected to be in bad shape, then their efforts will be considerably weakened to elect a husband to the Supreme Court from among themselves.
George V. Bush called the senators, lobbiing them to support Caveno, who worked at the White House during the Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 seats are currently held by Republicans and 49 seats by Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Caveno could obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pens, Vice President, to settle the vote and approve it in the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership "reduced" the number of North Korean political asylum seekers
The number of North Korean political asylum seekers in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean merger ministry, said last year there were 1127 political asylum seekers, compared to 2011, when their number was 2706.
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and high rates of human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
Most of the political asylum seekers from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them go through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarisation Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China's political asylum seekers are regarded as illegal immigrants and are being deported by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearisation talks.
This happened after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when, on large trains, they agreed to cooperate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for progress that has not been achieved since these talks.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Breta Caveno "hysterical" and claims that he is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
The court's minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Breta Caveno "hysterical" and claimed that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court due to his temperament.
Pelosi made comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, they'd call her 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of his response to the testimony given Thursday to the Senate Procedure Commission.
Caveno emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment to Dr. Kristina Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his initial argument, Caveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and smoking, talking about his family and high school years.
He, in particular, condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling for charges against him of "gross and coherent destruction" organised by liberals, angry at the loss of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believes that the testimony of Cavena is a justification for not being able to work in the Supreme Court, because it shows that she has a bilateral attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and attitudes toward Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to question Cavena if she was approved and if the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I would say that if he didn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he wasn’t fit for a position not only in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the existing court,” Pelosi said.
Caveno is currently a judge at the Washington Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possibility that Caveno would make decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wied because he considered him a conservative judge.
In his approval negotiations, Caveno circumvented questions about whether he would reject the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“There is no right time for a hysterical and biased man to work in court, but we would expect to be happy to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” Pelosi said.
But women have to hold their hands.
It is a denial, for months and years everything has accumulated "over the edges", but she is not allowed to make it all out of herself.
"We get angry when we're angry," Steinem told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's something uncommon, what do you think?"
She continued, "At one time, a woman who was herself a manager at a company was very helpful to me, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique — when she became angry and started crying to her person I was talking to.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I think it's great."
Assassins are only partially recognized as a form of discharge of anger, because they are misunderstood on the very grounds.
One of my brightest memories is from the oldest work in which there was an expression of the proportion of men, when I once cried out inexpressible anger, when a beautiful older woman — a reluctant driver (woman) — followed me behind me, of whom I was always a little afraid.
"Never let them see that scream!" she told me.
"They don't know you've moved.
They think you're stuck and you're just glad you managed to "scratch under the skin."
Patricia Shreeder, then a U.S. Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gerry Hart on his election as campaign president.
In 1987, when Hart, who was caught in extramarital relations, dropped the ship, also called "doing fools" and quit the election, Shredder, deeply disappointed, considered that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
“The election was already seven other candidates and the last thing they wanted to see was another one.
There were those who called it "The Snow Whites and the Seven Sharks."
She later participated in the campaign, she canceled the fundraising and promised not to participate in the election unless <0x24>2 million was raised.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that many of her supporters, who donated <0x24>1,000 to men’s representatives, donated her only <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she was not going to start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her, disappointed in the system, which made it very difficult for her to raise money and the voters to be delegated — in anger about sex.
"You would think I have a nervous breakdown," recalled Shr<0xC4><0x93>dere, referring to how the press reacted to him.
"You'd think Cleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they would write on my gravestone.
"She was crying."
Why the U.S.-China trade war could be favorable to Beijing
The main allegations about how the trade war between the United States and China began are being concealed and until the battle is over, conflicts between the countries may be favourable to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, taxing China’s main export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates affecting the unit’s <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) value, immediately applying half of the goods exported to the U.S. from China.
Beijing also responds "welcome" each time, the latest being a five to ten percent rate on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has announced its commitment to respond to the U.S. one by one, and it is doubtful that in the near future, the world’s second-largest economy could shrink.
In order for Washington to resign, certain demands should be agreed, but public worship of the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can positively affect China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the economies of the two countries.
“The fact that a quick political decision was made in either Washington or Beijing could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries that are really more dangerous than previously recognized by observers,” said Abigail Grays, a New American Security researcher.
Syria is a "gateway" for the reception of refugees, the Foreign Minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to restore the country that has been plagued by the war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almulam said that the situation in the country is improving.
"The situation on the ground is now much more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
There are all the conditions for refugees to voluntarily return to a country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that the country has lost 5.5 million Syrians since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country and they need humanitarian assistance.
Almulam said that the Syrian regime will accept assistance in the restoration of the devastated country.
But he stressed that the state would not accept the help of conditions or the help of countries that helped sponsor the unrest.
European golf team sensationally wins the Raiders Cup in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Raiders Cup, overcoming the U.S. golf team with a score of 16.5:10.5 "Le Golf National" outside of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when the Danish team led by Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to beat the US.
US star Son Michaelson, who had a hard time running the whole tournament, threw his T-shirt in the water at PAR 3 16th berth, climbing in the match of Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari played brilliantly in all of his stages, becoming one of four players who have ever managed to get a 5-0-0 score since 1979, when the tournament was played according to the existing format.
If you are a member of the European Union, you will be able to share your personal information with the European Parliament and the European Parliament, and you will be able to share your information with the European Parliament.
The best player in the world, Dastin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 Ian Polter from England, who was probably the last Raider's Cup.
Eight Raiders' Cup veteran, Spanish Serhio García, became the tournament's best player of all time from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"For now, I'm not sick, but today I can't control tears."
This was a fun year.
I am grateful to Thomas that he raised me and trusted me.
I am very, very happy that we have recovered the cup.
This is the team's merit and I'm happy to be able to help," Garcia emotionally commented after winning the European Championships.
He then gives the name to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday won the US golf legend Tiger Woods with 2 to 1 in a single game.
"This is the pride I would feel in winning Tiger Woods, I grow up following this player's runs," said 23-year-old Rams.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and currently has a career record with 13-21-3 in the Raiders Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time who has won 14 top-level golf tournaments, being the second after Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. team fought for the weekend to find their chances, except for Patrick Ryde, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furick, the captain of the U.S. team, said after his team's unsatisfactory performance: "I was proud of the guys, they fought.
Today was the time when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We've been fighting.
With all due respect to Tomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players missed a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and the U.S. Raider Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to stick to your hats.
We won."
