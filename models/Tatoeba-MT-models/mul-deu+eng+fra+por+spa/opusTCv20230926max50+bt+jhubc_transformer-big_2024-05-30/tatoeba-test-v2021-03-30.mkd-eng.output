It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised he'd help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said that this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go after him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're cold.
I'm a pedestrian.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I turn to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom's not giving me enough help.
I'm not using it, Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean to him?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them up.
How much is it worth?
Our water was up to the gushy.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
Probably still has it.
She looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What's this?
No one knows this.
The drain was blocked.
Breakfast is from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Tom came back last week.
Everyone was frightened.
I've watched so far.
You made a good choice.
Nudists consider the nudity to be normal.
We sat down and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
They kidnapped me.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
It's mine, give it back to me.
The wolves were destroying the flock.
That song has been chasing me for years.
I'm working.
We'll get there.
Did Tom pay the flat?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are idiots.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you fired a gun before?
I like that tattoo so much.
Get a ticket for the fuck.
I don't want to go to the police.
You're angry, I can recognize.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you later?
I feel lonely in the city.
What have they done so far?
Tom is childless.
I don't live in Boston.
He sued the government for the damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch had a guarantee.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ringing.
Tom was doing what Mary told him.
Show us where you found it.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for this job is huge.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he was not a good father, so he tries to redeem himself.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wants me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have to admit something.
Alcohol was affecting him.
Dan decided to leave the city.
You don't know anything.
Tom looks around him.
They're pretty safe.
There's a little bit of rubbing in the eyes.
No one cares about it.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I'd definitely answer.
I have to help him.
He's being criticized.
You'll find out when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom shaved his mast.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure that Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go for a picnic with John.
Don't be an asshole with me.
I think you did it.
We didn't originate from the monkeys, but we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about giving up?
It lasted all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's a big brother to me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop making him angry, Tom.
What could go the wrong way?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom was having breakfast later.
Can you help her?
Are you two relatives?
He likes cheese with eggs.
Just put it on my account.
First, I would take the subway rather than the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously an asshole.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did he give everything he could?
Mary took over the film.
She's got a nice manuscript.
Tom knew why Mary was hitting John.
Tom, I wrote the report.
Do they buy these?
It doesn't look very good.
Hey, can you give me that back?
That was personal.
I'd better go too.
Excuse me briefly.
Take off the hat.
Acting is very good.
Please, don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I'm not going to be alone here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do you really want to eat pizza early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke in French.
He's shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know that Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose flows every time I get stuck.
We've met a few times.
No one liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
Everybody is looking for happiness.
Is anyone else in the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me awful in high school.
Tom was wearing a cap that still had the price.
Tom promised he'd help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
There has to be a difference.
The ring's cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what he wrote in a newspaper.
Tom said it was an emergency.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would borrow you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient, even obedient.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having some fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human beings.
Don't be a mold man.
She and she tried.
Run! Run!
Is it paying for the delivery?
I want the rehearsals.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He has a weak heart.
Did you buy them to me?
You didn't see that, did you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
The mosquitoes are transmitting malaria.
You've been postponing this for too long, you've got to finish it tonight!
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What's wrong with you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We're taking checks.
Spring costs <0x24>1.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You hit one.
Macedonian has four verbal ways: pronounced, conditioned, ordered, and displayed.
They haven't gone yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The peaceful surface reflected its drawings as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are accurate.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We are the champions.
He frightened Tom.
That's quite true.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember when I met the queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom is a martyr now.
Tom looked angry.
What will the Japanese economy look like next year?
That's how I got in trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
Why didn't you sleep?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a seal.
I have to think of myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard is big.
It's a children's game.
Tom, you're not upset.
I'll be back at six and a half.
Tom takes me out of my mother's ass.
I didn't have an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show has to go on.
Make a good standing scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't draw attention.
I'm almost out of my mind.
Pick up your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
There's no gasoline.
Tom's a coward.
Who's on the list?
He has a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, bro.
Get me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Are we here to wait for him?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought Mary's flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I go with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom's spending a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was the food.
Make sure you don't get stuck in the hot bar.
They both coughed.
The train passed through the tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't expect them.
Are meals included in the price?
That would follow.
You want tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
The sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the sad day that they will try to escape.
They're all insane.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom has known Mary since childhood.
I'm at the North Gate.
My answer is still affirmative.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why are you working for them?
Your future starts today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good series.
Tom's already questioned the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
Oh, that's weird.
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's having his room rotted.
No survivors.
She was supposed to shut up.
I'm not like you!
“It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.” – “Then why are you still alive?”
They were smiling quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I've put a slippery slope on him.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who is the loser?
That'll do the job.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will make you happy.
The king was particularly distressed to speak, because of his heavy speech mania.
She did not accept the invitation.
Tom was surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels were trying to sunk the submarine in vain.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to run away.
He's slipping.
When are you studying?
It was hard for Tom to swallow the pills.
It is worth citing a well-known passage of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom's unconscious.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by men-seekers.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't look busy.
We'll get it right away.
Didn't you hear me screaming?
Oh, for a walk.
Don't overeat.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Pull the plunger out.
I don't have any plans for tomorrow.
Tom stepped forward to listen to me.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
Didn't you want the prize?
Look at the smoke.
I'm glad you're happy.
They're dishonest.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that's holy.
I don't know how to help him.
Get tied up.
Make him admit it!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
- Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is yours.
We're bankrupt.
Everyone knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me a little bit?
I like the school's.
Call me if I need you.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son's not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's no height in his story.
The battle was short.
How late I am!
We've discussed this.
Tom got the ball.
Where is the closest seat?
Let them call me.
The electric heater heats the ceramic tiles from the floor of the bathroom.
Tom also helped Mary.
I know you'll give me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires a skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm tired of the war.
In the woods, monkeys descended from the little ones.
Let's forget for now.
Due to his father's sudden death, he renounced his plans to live abroad.
You get the data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, my ladies.
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know.
At first, I couldn't stand it.
He hung up his sleeve.
I didn't think you'd like it, Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Shut up!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone left except him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you were playing chess.
It's getting darker.
The pipes are blocked.
I hurt you, didn't I?
Tom doesn't know how to drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They crawled next to him.
Tom is not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked him to do.
Tom accidentally told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the report is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's going to help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the madman.
Unfortunately, you're going to have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't be so excited.
Sylvia liked the concerts a lot.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care about it?
How are you to blame for that?
Tom's a beer from a bottle of wine.
I fell off the wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in the book?
Do you mind?
When does it start to appear?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are breaking up.
Tom convinced Mary to donate money.
I have him with me.
Wasn't your name Cooky the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But I overstepped it.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I offered it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel very well today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
When I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with it.
Did she ask for money?
Hold it! Hold it!
We've got to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-stage process.
I have a little gift for him.
That's my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom is not shy at all.
Tom's running around the subway.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Senfs are really hot.
We advertise our products on TV.
I was cute.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost 30 years ago.
Tom is too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that.
You were a great mentor.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a scissor?
Tom is my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me in the head.
Is there anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's gonna have to go a little further.
You should try this one.
I expect a call from them.
They blocked him.
Tom's suffering.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, he didn't get what he hoped for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom is in serious need of help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
Didn't you know that Tom's a coward?
Tom found me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom stretched out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says the previous dentist told him that he would remove his nicotine flakes if he stopped smoking.
Don’t expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's what Tom just suggested.
It seems to me to be wrong.
Tom's a smart guy.
Carrot powder is a mixture of several spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything he said.
This has been a night of trouble.
Tom was driving through the city with a brake wheel without notice.
Yeah, anyways.
You want camping?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to exclude Mary from the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Keep it for yourself.
You have it now, don't you?
I'm pretty inflated.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher is probably turning into a grave now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, and do not view their own behavior as undesirable.
Wear high heels to make it higher.
You want a bowling?
Excuse me, I think you got something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right.
They robbed me three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Not the galleys.
I'm here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What does it have to do with it?
We're finally meeting you, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
He gave up the idea.
I'm sure I sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
How different he is.
Did anyone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom made a decision.
Tom's not going to be very effective.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used unpleasant expressions.
Your coffee is getting energy.
Tom was a nice man.
It's a great meracle for football.
Why did you ask me about it?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We'll miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom writes well.
Something very similar has happened to me!
I'll make sure that Tom writes his homework.
She no longer felt safe in her own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to beat the idea.
Tom's really annoyed.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all see her behavior as a negative one.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Don't let her go.
His eyes glowed with anger.
Why were you screaming?
Well, I got news.
This is a good place to set up a tent.
That was lovely.
Allow me to stay.
Tom races to help Mary.
Tom might have cancer.
If we work as a team, we can do everything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
He gave me his word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready too.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see that I don't need anyone here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
“I want to travel, too.”
There's a lot of birds in the woods.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
It was me who wanted to meet Tom.
You need to ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
Maybe Tom's richer than we thought.
I never intended to deceive you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear, and ran to the window.
I know your soy.
Excuse me.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Tobacco means suicide.
Butterflies, butterflies, and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light the fire.
I wanted to bring this to you as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom shaved his knee.
Where did the pine trees come from?
Can we talk up there?
It is made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom stood up, and the crowd clapped.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he failed.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink soda.
I want to find Tom.
He is also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize a guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Put it in.
You're cooking a peppermint.
There were no other clients.
I'm not leaving, so let it be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
He took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do it?
I quit smoking for a long time.
I know what that sounds like.
Tom didn't seem to have bothered to sit alone.
I'm feeling a lot better now.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
It's a shame the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped all of a sudden.
My dad was carrying me here when I was young.
You're such an asshole.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I had to shut up.
I'm hot.
Tom has arrived early.
He dried his wet clothes by the edge of the fire.
He has always learned his knowledge of the English language.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have blankets?
No part of the pig has failed.
She bought a century-old bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are gluing.
What's going to happen next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
The cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom packs his bags.
What's the benefit of that?
That's very useful.
Tom vibrated his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl was walking slowly.
It turns out you're unexpectedly flattering.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time. You can form opinions without needing facts.
It didn't go very well.
We've got to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom wasn't having lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
He was forced to do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be gloomy.
I can't open the weight.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't resist.
Tom's still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear it.
Tom smiled at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought.
I don't mind waiting here.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your lunch. I like your lunch.
That's not a big priority.
Take this. Take this.
What time is it now?
Do you understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom's always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your red eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I will never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
It's the first squirrel I've seen this spring.
You want to play?
Why did you fire us?
I was at home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems to be having fun.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Watch out!
Linda was pregnant and she suspected she was pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 in front of the main gate.
The meeting started more than an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I know and know.
I've got money.
You can study here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom's getting better.
Tom threw the arrows.
Don't make coconuts.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a dirty dress.
I'll say what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything for nothing.
The worst type of breastfeeding is emotional breastfeeding.
Let's take it seriously.
Beekeepers remove the sausage to collect the honey.
I need to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget it.
Tom won the fight.
You brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Is this where they work?
Tom's eyes glowed when Mary waited in the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you have helped us at all?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some kind of tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't really seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I haven’t solved the puzzle yet.
Tom was respectful of Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom was moving his fingers on his legs.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
It's not blue, it's violet.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Sheep usually kill them before they turn one year old, so they eat them.
Could you get the arrow out of my leg?
I've forgotten how smart you are.
Can I see her?
Spending money in the bar is water.
We're not hiding anything.
Looks like I just didn't mean it.
I'm not sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
The book weighs.
Why do we have to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom's always lying to me.
The rooms at the hotel are obviously very badly sounds. I hear him chewing gum in the neighbor's room!
Are you scared?
Please, feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
LOOK at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you hitting me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels don't keep us and lead us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
Therapy didn't help.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was at his disposal.
Tom's going to town.
I am interested in Japanese culture.
This is java.
Who saw me.
Tom's approaching.
Tom is the real hero.
Where did he come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
It did work.
These goat's gone down.
Tom's gone fishing.
Tom didn't think for a second about trying to convince Mary to do so.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his closet.
Maybe we're relatives.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Can I use this pencil?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why are you asking?
It's not the other way around.
Tom's sleeping tight.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
She was standing in front of her.
There's more outlets.
Tom's always been very protective of the kids.
I asked him the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while our house was renovated.
He gave me six woolen shrimps.
I'm safe.
The bees look strange to you.
That's why I can't help you.
I haven’t had the time to write that report yet.
I can do without it.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
Get dressed.
Tom was threatening Mary.
Tom couldn't have been prevented.
I love to walk along the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom's blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this have happened?
I asked them to open the door.
Get out of here.
We've got to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom Kimna.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm 30 years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know how to sneeze?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
What about a sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Give them to the team.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was shed with blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you so much, Tom.
This morning we're going to eat Italian cherries.
And Tom's from Boston.
Watch out, it's a cruel bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I haven't had three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on the shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was indestructible.
It's the evening that suits me.
They were traveling to the east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The ceramics that fell from the roof have broken down.
Who is the owner of this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean the bathtub.
Call me anytime.
Tom would have thrown us out.
Tom's not ashamed.
I'm just completing the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's urgent.
You'd better go.
Tom pulled out the exit.
I have two cameras.
What did you find?
Dan confessed to Linda that she was a heavy drinker.
That's Tom's drawing.
The game isn't over.
Tom lowered his drink.
They stole my wallet in the bus.
Don't argue with me.
Looks like it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not here to help you.
Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
I was paid to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary screaming.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amebes are empty.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
That doesn't have to mean Tom's dead.
The waves create the wind.
Get a clean cup from the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father didn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a possibility they'll kill.
I left him a message.
Did you just see that?
That would be a disaster.
I like the way French writes their word for "bumbamara".
The crane can start twenty tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Is that right for you?
We're pretty good.
The pork is cut into cubes and sprinkled.
Ask a professional person.
I love travelling.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom apparently was trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and play.
It's kind of kind.
Tom wiped his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters extorted a large sum of money from the rich.
No one's ever coming here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
You bite your conscience, don't you?
He wanted blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that beard claw?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take it, baby, your nose is running.
Tom went with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
Initially, they were farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you'll regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely comes out.
We've set up a tent.
I didn't think it was going to rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Camoli would have stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom banned me.
You look very comfortable, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
I'm pretty healthy now.
Tom was still wearing a pyjama and a bathtub when I arrived in the morning.
We've all read that.
Get over here.
You're back.
The sentence is not grammatically correct.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Is there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
In the middle of the city there is a fountain.
You've got to help her.
The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is accurate and that its results are reliable.
I've tried.
A broken tree blocked the road.
Don't interrupt Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts have failed.
Mathematics is the best thing for him.
They were so happy together.
I thought you had already found a place to stay.
He put his head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't like that.
Did you see the wine this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom wants to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Alice.
He hurt me and called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's a slut.
Some fish know how to change their gender.
I can take it from her.
Bring some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse their kids.
You have to help him.
I thought you might be able to help.
I think you were exposed.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's down there.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
It makes us work too much.
Slow down.
He wants to be the newlywed at every wedding and to be the deceased at every funeral.
Tom's probably all right.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
You want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom was not surprised when he saw Mary with John.
Have a nice evening.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet climates are not inherent to the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary was going to help him.
Tom's never there.
Please don't give up on yourself.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom pulled out the pencil.
Why should I care what you're doing?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long should you take this medicine?
I don't need a bed.
Put us likes on Facebook!
Did you buy us something?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy don’t record their luck.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please, show me more.
I need to paint my house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm learning English.
What is usually the cause of pain?
We're addicted to work.
The box is made of tin.
She dropped the test for a reason.
Trust it in your intuition.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.
Tom's angry.
Try not to pay attention to Tom.
Mix all the ingredients in the bowl.
She lays sperm; she had a lot of sperm.
Tom's very boring.
I was vaccinated against the flu.
Just try it.
I like to play too.
Tom was a professor of piano.
Tom was one.
Is Tom interested?
Here it is.
I want to have a little chat with you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know how best he is.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I'm never surfing.
I'll find something.
We ate turtle soup.
We can work outdoors if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you've hidden Tom's treasures.
That cake is calorie.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I blame Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
They told me you know how to do this.
You're experienced.
Why isn't she confused?
It's not usually a pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed awkward.
Tom says Mary is supposed to be happy.
I got a car.
I'm not a nanny.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So, these are the weirdest prisoners I've ever seen.
This is where I spend most of the day.
Are we here to wait for her?
If you get out so naked, you'll get a cold.
Is it still hurting?
It was pretty funny.
I set it up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did you say anything, Tom?
Are they all busy?
They don’t want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Alah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom hurt him.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We did a quiz today.
I'm serious.
Give me the wine.
All shops are closed.
You made white again!
Stop squeezing your ass.
Tom's done with the gardens.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
We're unnecessarily dramatizing.
We believe in God.
We have to do everything we need to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom agree with the co-workers?
That smells like a cough.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you a little advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult person.
I can't call them home.
You're a racist.
I've already forgiven you.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
What is it short?
Thank you again for coming.
My mother.
The wounded soldier barely left.
The sun is just rising.
Actually, I know the answer to that question.
Why don't you shut me up?
What's stopping Tom from doing it again?
Tom often downloads movies.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
The light is turned off by water.
Tom squeezed the soup.
I'm not fucking you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the items on the table.
The police threw Dan in jail.
Go back to your places.
Can I touch you?
You miss something?
Let a man sit down to cry.
Are you going to help him?
We walked among the trees.
Anyway, I'll do it.
I knew you'd stand on Tom's side.
They couldn't have avoided them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to God, not to His prophets.
Tom acted like a cavalryman.
We're on a date with him now.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch in the morning.
I hate when you fight.
I was supposed to be more cultural.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
You're squeezing your buttocks with a hose.
I'm sorry, but my answer is no.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give any gift to Tom.
Tom was a worker.
Tom lived right next to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to learn.
He went down the aisle.
Do you want me to invent something?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'll go with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's see.
The Europeans want to drink wine.
My husband is a good man.
He has a lot of debt.
He knows the most important cities.
What's under the cover?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom's all touring for drinks.
Are you ready to go?
Tom's obviously insane.
Tom came to them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom probably didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was very proud of her brilliance.
The teacher surrenders.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm carrying my passport.
It was a masterpiece that they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she'll be back.
I don't have a pen.
When should we start to worry?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to say that?
They concluded that the ship had sunk without a second.
Did you buy the medicine?
Did Tom drink?
It hurts my job.
The question is who will do that.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we'd stay here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I should call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would really like to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please, ask me what it is.
Hey, what's up?
I'm not shy.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a backward.
He walks to school.
It starts to come into our mind that we can’t ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very imaginative.
Now the question is what we should do.
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
He finished fourth out of 56 runners.
Not the galleys.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a child, he became obsessed with the girl who lives on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds very good.
Tom really likes Boston. He really likes Boston.
Tom annoyed Mary's silence.
They'll be there soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my rooms.
They didn't act quickly.
I'm weak.
Weave a woolen sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever, unless someone kills them.
I don't want to hang out with Tom.
You'll never be accepted into that club.
Tom was not born blind.
Is Tom looking for them?
Here's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
Animals are endangered.
Tom made a proposal.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
They all turned to look at her.
Don’t dare ask them about it.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has a huge potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so that we didn’t miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so worried tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're exaggerating.
Please, let me finish it.
Tom says it's not too late for compensation.
Is the house ready?
Tom's whistles are raging, and they get even better as soon as he drinks a few beers.
You have kind eyes.
You don't understand business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
If it were, it would be repaired... when the worm gives birth to the grape.
Tom's an adviser.
Can I talk to you?
He insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when does he have a firearm?
Tom might be alone.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom loves him the same as you do.
I didn't betray anything.
Yesterday I thought of you.
I know where to look for them.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to quit smoking.
I'm losing my hair.
The big question that no one has found an answer, including me, despite thirty years of research on the female soul, is “What do women want?”
I tried to pretend that I was something I wasn't.
The villagers are harvesting.
Tom wouldn't like that.
Tom and his friends went to a circus.
How deep is the failure?
I can work wherever I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises. Keep your promises.
I've been looking everywhere.
What was the subject?
With every breakup, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Is it over your head?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was devastated.
Tom needed some advice.
My laser printer also knows how to scan pictures.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe it?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that picture is.
They're all up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when it's your birthday.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Keep me lucky! Keep me lucky!
The concert ended with the national anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Hold on a second.
I have something to do.
Your propaganda isn't interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
All the nuances are lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I don't have any comments.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's a lot of air here.
Married to zero of a man.
The wind is stiff.
Nothing has changed.
You don't have to wear anything at all.
The old man died before he died.
I don't like the book.
Fortunately, I hit him.
What would Tom want that for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I'm a real squirrel.
Can someone help me out?
We're leaving this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to beat Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you google it?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't worry about me, Tom.
How old is the TV?
Mystery is solved.
Tom took him to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, here's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's what I do.
Are you sure we shouldn't have a date first?
The one who can hear the butterflies laughing knows what the clouds taste like.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't end up with them.
They pulled the trigger to see who was going first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not to wait as a commodity!
But if I were in Brazil, I would be much more afraid.
Have you worked as a bartender before?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just finished my work hours.
Where will the product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food is cold, heat it in the microwave.
The stream is to the right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This seems too simple.
I want to get my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he had saved.
I think it's time you left.
He's a gangster.
Tom might have seen it.
Tom's a bit of a bitch.
Tom's very suspicious.
What'd they do?
What is the volume of a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's drinking.
I've accepted your company.
Tom, you gotta get up.
Tom wants revenge.
Tom stabbed a crane in the plug.
Will I be replaced?
I need to find some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks it's too cool for me.
Whales are a kind of mammals.
Dan whispered to Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems shocked.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, and you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat in that restaurant.
He's ready to turn.
This will greatly ease our work.
I think that's awful.
What's on the desk?
Are You Still Jealous?
Why would he leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian to her mother.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings have not been returned.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral march.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this one.
Drop the sleeves.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles is it from here to Boston?
I really care about that.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family, as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He develops feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who's in charge of things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I'd never accept it.
It'll get even colder.
What are you drinking?
How it came to pass, so it came to pass.
His legs were swollen.
Tom picked up his keys.
It all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any new accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on the map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went to an angel.
Look at the front.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Did Tom bother you?
This is my last turn.
I haven't been well for two days.
It's a waste hose, it's a nice twist.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a brain and an ass.
The police have arrested her.
Take these. Take these.
We're expecting her.
The rain doesn’t come to light.
I'll tell them to go right away.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got an ace.
There was no soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you in a long time, guys.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
You want to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was kissing Mary with a shitty egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes sense.
I set them up.
What Are the Symptoms of Fungal Poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I want to watch porn with lesbians.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure that John writes his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom's worried right away.
I don't have feelings for her.
Looks like I expected a little better.
I already believe it.
She writes a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to cross the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
Taste yourself.
The old cottage has some charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely survived.
Did they hire you?
Gas leaks.
Tom could see that Mary was texting.
You'll be better.
Tom was a little astounded.
Let's do this right.
In Hawaii, you can cruise all year round.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most people think that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just come to a woman and fuck her - that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I love him.
Find your own supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sedated.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I go on?
He was smoking a lot.
I'm a patient man.
That's not happening here.
It’s better to be optimistic and to stand out than to be pessimistic and to be right.
The water was mild.
I'm waiting for the semester to change.
The boy was silent.
The body of the ship is divided into several water-resistant parts.
Given what you cooked, I'll wash dishes.
Let's leave the theme.
Tom knows something he doesn't tell us.
When are you going home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your condition.
There are fake spots.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cake.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the throbbing?
I'm not gonna wait for them.
You don't have to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh, no!"
He's no longer such a shy boy as he was.
Countess?
Don't make a scene now.
What did you tell Tom?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never evil.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
Everywhere there were boys divided into groups. Some played mosques, some tiles, some with a ball. Others were riding a wheel or riding wooden horses.
Suspects are destroying friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle yet.
We both have to go.
The pain that causes love is the sweetness of any pleasure.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Let's go over there.
I've just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You misjudged her.
Wait for me to check the manual.
The energy comes from the inside.
No one trusts them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He shook his head.
We're in.
Get the seat back.
What's his name?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want to get my job back.
This is not normal.
Can I talk to you tomorrow?
Tom's getting angry.
I can't find the equation.
Listening to a concert.
Did Tom subpoena Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm mad.
Today it's less wet than yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's strange how people in tropical areas eat spicy food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Is there nothing you can do?
Tom had no family.
I can't say what the baby wants, because it shows to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go back home.
That's true love.
Can you look at me?
Although he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom's got a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go get Tom together.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
That's a false trace.
Tom was fighting.
I said maybe it'll turn out.
I need you to open the door to me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Somebody's singing.
Do you know how to fix the wrist?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're handcuffed?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Her underwear has a shell on one side.
Let's be late.
I'll be out right away.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing well.
She doesn’t know how to read or write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had a deal.
They're all waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We've all noticed that.
You have very nice lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know that Tom will someday get out of jail.
The most expensive thing is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
We're out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him for a job.
Why do you object?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my cousin.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Calculate how much money we will need next year.
I ignited a scissor in the dark.
How much does it cost there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
You get up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
In which country is Boston located?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I was suffering from pneumonia, I was just squeezing into my room, waiting for me to recover.
Don't thank me now.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom was playing the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
He's sworn in.
Tom saw something.
I've become a lawyer to help people.
You just heard it.
Tom's got a headache.
Oh, no.
There's no one.
That's not advisable.
I agreed to help her out.
Tom wants to quit.
He did everything he could.
He's a cucumber.
First, let's talk about what Tom should do.
Mommy's buying me a toy.
I'm not going to risk that.
This house needs to be repaired.
I'm excited, Tom.
Tom's a runner.
Tom's not listening.
They immediately want everything you told them you would give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, men and women are very different.
I go fishing every week.
What's your decision?
Is that necessary?
Tom's suspended.
I'll never love you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The bunker is dry.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe you'd better call them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What do I have to do with this?
Is your dog lashing?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I really like German crofts.
We were eighteen years old then.
I make <0x24>13 an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I love broccoli, but I hate carrots.
I get discouraged when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom's running.
Go on with that.
This is repulsive.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
Is Tom hurt?
They're drunk.
Tom was starting to feel sorry.
I think you should choose her.
Hold on.
You're magnificent.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Pull out the candles and imagine a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom stared at Mary.
Tom was wearing a duck.
Tom looks decisive.
I'm glad she didn't call.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended not to know Linda.
Swimming in the river.
Are you ready yet?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who Causes the Fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, preferably.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the gardens.
Tom's a joke.
I've been a lot worse.
Tom struggled to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be slim.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Have you gotten there yet?
I only drank one glass.
No one writes to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm looking for.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to speak with his mouth full.
They're all out of control.
Every customer has their own rights.
I'm calling you as long as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What were you doing last time?
We've won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
He said it was wrong: I went to the market because the car was broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little bit.
Who's Dan talking to?
He's pushing us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't go to parties often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not really hot.
It was after midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change your shampoo?
Tom was looking around, the bar was expecting something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's warm here, you can take off your coat.
I don't think they followed me.
They have no defense.
They often help others.
Tom is a big pessimist.
You're entitled to a phone call.
The skiing was actually a lot more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's catch that guy.
I do my best.
I don't remember their debts.
I don't want to get involved.
Their friendship has quickly grown into love.
Tom's acting so alone.
I'm gonna stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the forms.
I don't imagine having a party like that, but like you want.
Do you think Tom would like to come with us?
Yoga comes from India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom put his toast in butter.
We've got work to do.
I heard him like a squirrel.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives there, on Riddon.
I'll accept anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
Soon it will be Christmas.
You need to feel more relaxed.
Unfortunately, this is an inaccurate formulation of the question.
Tom seems to have been used to such problems.
You'll be fine.
It was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom's wooden.
Let's sing and dance.
After a war, the winners are always right, and the defeated are the culprits.
Tom and give Mary a doll.
Translation of jokes is quite difficult, if it can be said at all possible.
It was an arena day.
I'm carrying bad news.
This doesn't help.
Overcome the weakness.
How many skeletons do you make a day?
I'll just sit here.
You don't have a random key?
Let's be realistic.
Lemon tea, please.
Tom's out of business.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was full of alcohol.
Tom's up.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Were you one of them?
He's got a little joint.
I'll make sure we finish the project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
The music is universal.
You squeeze too much when you handle.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me get you, Tom.
He won the first place in the match.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan smokes marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
Yesterday she was late.
You're disgusted.
They're all in the corner.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad, what's wrong?
He gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
Maybe it sounds weird.
No one can be saved from death.
It won't help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times so far.
Somebody open the door.
Is this yours?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom of speech.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
How much do we need?
He was desperate because of his health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom's got a pain in his ear.
Dan hit him on the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you that idea?
What did Tom do?
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
It's not the right time.
You don't have any more alcohol.
When are you going?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
There was a song in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
Now it's all over.
I tried to get him to come.
What's the point, Tom?
The mother's advice would outweigh the friendly.
We haven’t been saved from the danger yet.
Tom's angry.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a goat.
Dan is now calling the police.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.

The flowers are coming.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise you.
This is very nervous.
We need more American slang on Datoeba, under urgently!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom's gonna get scared and give up.
Is this place free?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want tea.
In any case, I wouldn't want to get caught.
No one wants to sit with you?
It'd be really nice to be quiet.
Tom said Mary was having a bad influence.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do that.
It wasn't easy for us.

I'm gonna fly out of school.

Hold on to the plan.
If you're hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's complicated.
Check to see if the gas is off.
Would you participate in this event?
There's hardly any coffee left in the dish.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written a couple of books together.
Why are you so mad?
I'd rather have coffee than tea.

He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.

You're the man, Tom?

Can be used in meals?

Who'd wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom salted his salad.

Save him, Tom.
You haven't solved the problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've read it already.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
No one's gonna find me.
Tom's very angry.
In what situations would you use it?
Can't we start from the beginning?
Unfortunately, you'll have to do this without anyone else's help.
We're all under threat.
Tom won't like it.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom's breathtaking.
Take Tom's gun.
Look back. Look back.

It's cold for me.
Tom played the piano for three hours without interruption.
I got quality.
Did you find someone to take care of the child?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom clings to the voice.
Does it matter which of these I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Are you going to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
There's nothing to say.
It would be good.

I've seen him personally.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not gonna do what you're asking for.

What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There's no substitute.

I lost my hand lamp.
It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.

You're below his level.
My goal is to hurt.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
Tom might hire Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe this to Tom.
Tom's a very young man.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry up to catch the last train.
Please, ventilate the room.
Tom is still trying to persuade Mary to accept the job.
How much of our body is water?

That's very smart.
Please help me get through tom.
You're very smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don’t hold on for more than five minutes.
If time was running, radioactivity was decreasing.
Do we have to believe that?
What's the matter with you?
I think I know how to stop him from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom sits behind Mary's class in French.
How can you help her?
Tom put him in a trap.
I'll turn them over.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brought you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're a bitch.
What'd you do?
Why are you angry with me?
I can't read without glasses.
I don't mind helping.
No one did anything else.
I'm sorry I'm falling in this way.
The books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom wiped out the gardens.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleeping anymore.
Tom made a good statement.
They must be worried.
I transported him.
That gave me an idea.
The federation of the watch is broken.
I was wondering about him.
Tom says Mary likes you too.
Come on, everybody, get me.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom's not that old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Kids need love.
That's his job.
He asked me to bring the camera with him.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You have to do that somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe that anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to cheat on the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom took the gun.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made the box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Come on, let's get together.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me happy.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny character.
Did you buy something to eat?
Boston is a wonderful city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil does a storm collect?
Eat slowly.
There may be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
Butterfly is green.
Tom regrets what he told Mary.
Go find him.
She's in the basement.
Tom's getting cold.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's aware.
Tom shaved your hair.
They're all sitting.
He gently touched her.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't like walking.
She looks a little young to get married.
I hate schoolboys.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're just getting started.
His brother is more patient than him.
No one could prove anything.
What hobbies do you have?
So, I'm serious.
Prohibited speech during the test, folks.
I had to.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary doing it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give you a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write a letter of thanks to Tom.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom is back in Boston.
The light's gone.
Come on!
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to have breakfast in bed.
Dan walks his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp over.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
It's very close.
We took care of you.
Experience is not inherited – everyone gets their own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
The fabric stretches a lot when it is washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I blame him.
Have you heard of him?
Tom began to speak.
I ran out of an hour.
Tom is still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without a fucker, it'll be hard for me to catch fish.
Tom was dreaming.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces inhibitions.
Tom needs a couple of help.
I'll tell him to go right away.
Tom seems confused.
No one wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her nostrils were black and deep like a bottomless pit.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little bit more with the kids.
They all have drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He is a strict critic.
I was curing my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you didn't forget something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I let you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a very good place.
I have a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swimming because it was cold weather.
You don't have to.
I just wanted to clear up the situation.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll call you.
We can't get to Tom's house this time.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far from the Himalayas.
Tom's pissed off.
Please do it again.
You're very dramatic.
Tom's beating himself up.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She was going to school.
It is said that Marie Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's strong.
Why don't you buy more than one?
We were working.
But it's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me make you something.
You've got too much work to do.
Could that be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He has been elected mayor of Boston.
Police found footprints of shoes at the scene of the crime.
I asked the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
What are you not going to find?
Tom keeps the letter.
Tom would have liked that.
She's running out of half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom must not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come along too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that what I said?
Tom's a crutch.
I'll have to try to handle this myself.
They've been probing the spaceship.
Yesterday, Tom wrote me more than 30 messages.
Are you sure this is not a diamond?
You let Tom run away.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
Dream that you know.
I looked at her.
A large crowd gathered together.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle for too long.
The weather in April is inconsistent.
Take your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
It's hot.
Tom was the boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut off the sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's legs were cold.
Girls and boys are reading.
Tom has two children.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran in the castle.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my luck.
Take Tom's advice.
Tom left unwanted food on the plate.
Tom changed direction.
There's no living person in the classroom.
The rocket's flying.
We were laughing.
Tom was a little confused.
Tom just came to visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
I wish you a happy trip.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was blindfolded.
Tom tries to seem busy so that Mary does not ask him to help her.
I rarely eat meat.
I'll go ask her.
I keep him seated.
Tom couldn't help.
I'll call her later.
The flowers are quickly veined after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm carrying a bag of rice.
I can do that for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I ate late last night.
I just don't like it.
Plus, I know how to fly.
We've been wasting our money.
There was hatred between them.
There's nothing to see here, let's go.
Does that sound silly?
I don't want you to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I have never dared to be anything other than what I am.
Sometimes it's hard to tell if Tom is happy or not.
This doesn't make me hot.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Have you imagined a wish?
Kids are afraid of the dark.
Stay away from it.
I had to stay.
Tom's the only one here who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked Mary for money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna catch you.
My bags are packed.
Tom's pissed.
I cut my hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
Here's what I liked.
He crossed the street.
As long as there is life, there is hope.
I heard them licking.
It's a shame I didn't ride a bike here.
I have to visit Tom.
What are you uncomfortable with?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not that much.
That's what I said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
Let me be damned!
I would walk alone first.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of an overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not moody.
What did you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to embarrass you.
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to look at another option?
He didn't even give them a chance.
He suddenly showed up.
I'll do as you say.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He's selling half-cars.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
You know that?
He did the job badly.
Tom's cold.
Emily is a teenager.
They think it's overnumbered.
Who was the thief?
He has charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the footage doesn’t sound like my natural voice.
I told you this would be painful.
I didn't know if I was going to be angry or laughing.
I'm mad at you.
We've been waiting.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
I've always loved a dog.
You're quite safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is whether he will come to visit us next month.
The puppets control the wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you.
The other girls were strangling her because of her clothes.
You'll be confused.
I'm not following you.
Maybe Tom has already done what he should have done.
I'll give them another chance.
He just called me.
Failure suppressed it.
How are you doing these days, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
She doesn't even understand me.
Beekeepers believe that genetically modified plants are harmful to bees’ health.
Now you can go.
They're long-lasting.
Tom is the second year.
If I can understand, then anyone can.
The tourists were not satisfied.
Tom put his socks down.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom Pelletchie.
Laws are like spiders - they hunt flies, but they let axes and spiders break through.
You're proud of Pooh.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left his key on the desk as he used to.
She put her fur coat down, climbed up, and gently knocked on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't look at the same topic, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something happened to Tom.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are attractive, but we're a city.
We were looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
How long has Tom been here?
He's texting his boyfriend.
Did anyone see Tom?
He avoided the danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I need to repeat that?
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
Sounds like it's made it easy for you.
Tom is unforgettable.
Kyoto is a very beautiful city.
The handle doesn't turn.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I am writing my will.
"Why did you break my vase?" "It was a pleasure."
We were very close.
I sweat every day.
Give me your knife.
No one has defended my country.
Tom has never given up.
I asked her not to interfere.
Tomorrow is not a big day.
Tom is a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is amazing. It's amazing.
Wait for me to breathe.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet? It doesn't matter! I just found it under the couch.
He's watching TV now.
What's going on here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's a coincidence.
I'm so glad I'm home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can hang me, torture me, even destroy my body, but you'll never capture my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It's happening all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try the sweater.
The cat threw his fist in my hand.
"When did you fall asleep yesterday?" "At four o'clock." "What? What were you doing so late?" "I was on the phone with my ex."
How did you get them?
No offense!
I was a little burdened with something else.
His heart was broken by unrequited love.
When's too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're annoying me.
His rank is not high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
I belong here.
You're my friends.
He's a professional chairman.
Tom is not as naive as many think.
I hit him boxing in the trailer.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm gonna take a break for lunch.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there that word at all?
You're not Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
They all rejected Tom.
You can't fire him.
Ken collects old coins.
There's a lot to say.
I heard you say what you said.
We have to face the facts.
There's no damage.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom scares me.
Tom's sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a taxi.
You're not in any danger.
What can I choose from?
We've got to get them to bed.
The only spic that Tom puts on meat is pepper.
That's how I got closer to Tom.
I don't want to disorganize them.
Tom was beaten.
We're really good.
He fell asleep while driving, causing a traffic jam.
I brought a few bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was very nervous.
Why does Tom do that?
I have a job for you.
How is a plurality of names formed?
You saved my life.
It was too little.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
He took a nasty cold from me.
It's getting better.
This world is a valley of tears.
You don't have to be abnormal to work here.
I saw Tom.
He's not even angry.
Tom dropped the rifle.
Tom's gotta get a bottle.
Get me some coffee.
You're always right.
It was a petty trick.
We will pass the theory on to the mathematicians.
Where did this come from?
We're not ready.
Tom was put in prison for espionage.
Is there any way we can help him?
I hope you and Tom won't be too disappointed.
These small letters are only read with a pencil.
I can't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a cutter.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I'm not gonna hold my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear sadness in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
He would do anything to make money.
Now I recognize you.
I don't want you to say something you don't think about.
I decorated my room.
This is pure madness!
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
Stay with Tom to make his slippery slope.
Our tail was approaching the small island.
You're not gonna win.
Wait a minute, my underwear's done, I'm going to get it.
Tom was a miner.
It's deep white.
I wish I had enough willpower to keep a diet.
The man in question is currently in America.
He thinks he's guilty.
I'll take a look at him, Tom.
I'll be at my desk.
I'm here for the first time.
That sounds so bad to me.
My eyes are tired.
I need to get away from her.
Tom earns <0x24>300,000 a year.
Do I really need this?
Are you expecting them?
The service is fast.
We had to help Tom.
That's all they're talking about.
One boy grabbed my bag while he was on a bike.
When was the last time you kissed the baby?
My muscles hurt a little.
We have experience.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'm backwards.
I'm going to be fired because I'm too late to work.
I thought it would be nice to buy you a couple of skirts.
Tom, what's he gonna do now?
That's right!
There's always a fine.
Your health is very important to me. Why don't you go to the doctor?
Spirit, are you there?
There are no smokers here.
Is the freezer still working for you?
The city has restored this old, historic building.
I can't ask him for that.
He's really ugly.
Tom came back covered in mud.
That's not for you.
Tom was wondering if Mary would know what was wrong.
I don't have anything else.
Tom's in the pool with his friends.
Tom wasn't paranoid.
You're very good with kids.
I just threw it in the trash.
We just came from there.
Tom booked a seat.
I want to use this.
What color were Tom's socks?
Tom made me a cake.
I've never been a tax collector before.
I've always admired Tom.
I don't want to be touched.
Look at the clouds.
He was so angry that his veins were stained.
Travelling overseas doesn’t come in handy.
Tom ended up as a winner.
Tom came right away.
I'm here to apologize.
It won't be enough.
I'm hiding from Tom.
I went home and told my wife about my job in Boston.
Tom got dressed and went to bed.
And the opposite applies.
Tom's very naive.
Tom didn't want to go so early.
I'll explain later.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I'm getting a mastic.

Have you been there?
She's wearing hats.
No lack of stones.
Tom went on a bike.
He came back at 6:00.
It has been proven that dogs’ turtles jump higher than cats’ turtles.
Be careful when you climb the ladder.
Were you with anyone?
I'm not a monster.
What's this made of?
Butler opened the door.
Tom was completely wrong.
Take your whispers away from me.
Don't say that name around me.
You're gonna throw that away?
Tom's got a good job.
These are my things.
Tom went for a walk every day.
The same thing happened to my friend.
I don't feel it for you anymore.
Tom's not stupid.
Tom changed the subject.
We're gonna deal with this.
It feels so good.
What's Tom drinking?
I'll read this over.
Give me the glasses.
I'm helping them with something.
I know about him.
We've got the key.
Tom had a catastrophic failure.
He just came back from vacation.
Tell your son to stop bored with my daughter.
The text is too long.
When did you come to Boston?
Something hit me.
Mushrooms contain significant amounts of minerals.
Tom left them.
She's avoiding me.
Tom's back to work.
I want you to find them.
Shouldn't we wait for them?
I wouldn't like that.
I hear you're rich.
Most people are more afraid to make a mistake than to make a mistake.
This is another stupid question, but who is stronger, the lion or the tiger?
We're gonna have company.
We're classmates.
Tom pulled the cap off the champagne.
Failing girl.
Tom despises your cowardice.
Don't eat live pork.
Tom made a list of the places he wants to visit.
From his point of view, I concluded that he was angry with me.
I miss Boston. I miss Boston.
The girl brought me a red and white rose.
We should ask them.
I think you know Tom.
They don't make you happy.
It's time to get to work.
Shot three times.
I'll complain if I like it.
They're grazing.
You're coming back?
We can talk about it.
My daughter sings in choir.
I don't have a word to say anymore.

We're the best.
Now go ahead.
Tom can't help you.
Tom doesn't go to the market.
Give me a few minutes.

Didn't you happen to know Tom?
Tom wasn't sure if he liked the plan.
Tom's a very young man.
Tom's so stupid.
Tom wants to see him.
Tom was just partially joking.
I'll find out who did this.
Tom hates his job.
I can make a call.
Why don't you trust me?
Tom was trying to avoid catching him.
Did you find her already?
Tom's alone there.
You did the job nicely.
Don't be a coward.
Freedom of speech is limited in certain countries.
Tom raised his hat.
We're looking for them.
I think Tom's right.
Could you recommend me a good book?
I'll take you home.
Does it hurt your stomach?
Is Tom dead?
You're not catching me.
Try to relax.
I think I love you.
I take care of all of you.
They stood next to her.
You're a pig.
You're not reliable.
Tom can be trusted.
It'll be hard to convince them.
Don't be fooled now.
Did anyone see Tom?
I'd love to help you with this.
I owe Tom a lot.
It was an amazing evening.
The smells of jasmine and lavender are my favorite.
I just want you to turn around and look at me.
Tom seemed to be bored.
She's very individualistic.
The knife had a very old top.
Get ready.
Put it down here.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you to burn, and you'd be the last bucket of water.
The universe is expanding.
I thought you'd lost your watch.
You're right now.
Not all of them sleep.
Did they all agree?
These are my pencils.
You're leaving, aren't you?
Do you know anyone who could help?
This week is extremely hot.
No one wanted to get out of the table.
Do you think Tom would like this?
Tom's been through the race.
He's a fool.
Maybe you can help them out.
The hearts of the broken mirror lay shattered on the floor.
I can't ask him for that.
Eat pork creams.
I have to go and help them.

Tom was waiting for a turn.
Tom knew exactly where he was going.
I'm sorry I lied to you too.
I've got a few free minutes.
I'm sorry, but I don't care about it right now.
When was the last time you went to an art gallery?
Play that song again.
I really like vanilla ice cream.
I just had breakfast.
Step by step, he goes down the stairs.
That shouldn't happen.
Let me change the subject.
I'm gonna make crackers.
Tom put a stethoscope on the patient's chest.
Should we call him?
My sister got more presents for Christmas than me.
What's going on with you at work?
What's with the tongue and doesn't taste?
Let's play football.
Tom stopped yelling.
Were there any survivors?
I'm still at work.
Tom's hot.
Where's the toilet?
Tom seems to know.
She gave birth to twins.
My boyfriend's a reporter.
What is Tom afraid of?
Tom would have resisted.
What brand of shampoo do you use?
It's for playing cards.
We all love you.
What were they doing?
I think you should go out alone with this.
As far as I can see, Tom's got nothing from a medical point of view.
I've seen playing cards with all of them.
Tom seems to be confident.
Shame on you!
Is Tom still alive?
Does Tom have a fox?
I thought you'd live with us.
How will I know how to come back?
I'm going to dinner with an old friend.
Eating can be spicy without being angry.
Bring her home.
I'd help if I could.
The one who loves flowers can't be a bad man.
Get your computer. Get your computer.
What's the key?
Tom needs to thank you.
I'll see you when I get there.
That could be true.
I wasn't sure what to do.
He asked me not to marry Tom.
I know what it is.
When's Tom coming?
Could you give me the remote control, please?
I'm gonna make him cut your lawn.
You can help her once.
We were crying in a duet.
I'll set the table.
I have a lot to say.
I was in the bedroom.
There shouldn't be any problems.
It's hard for me to imagine that.
Where is the nearest workshop for repairing the dirt?
Where did you go with Tom?
Does anyone know Tom's phone number here?
I don't know what I got.
I haven't fixed it yet.
I'm not working for him.
I can't wait to go home.
Tom committed suicide on his 30th birthday.
Let's go and see what happens.
The concerto piano has no pedals at all.

I love Boston so much.
I know a city that people never smoked.
I must have forgotten.
Tom convinced Mary to go to the party with him.
Tom knows how to do almost everything.
We arrested him.
What else could you have done?
Please sign up here, please.
I'll check if it's inside.
It's gonna be superstitious.
I don't think I can move.
I'm glad I can be yours.
He talks a lot.
I'm not quite normal.
I thought they found him.
Why don't we order a pizza?
The worse, the better.
Is your head full of straw?
Tom doesn't seem to speak French.
The fruit contains seeds.
You're doing a good job.
I don’t have enough time to do everything I need to do.
The forest is my home.
There's a swelling in the head.
Vampires can't cross the threshold of a certain house without being invited.
I think Tom's angry.
I need peace and quiet after a hard day at work.
If you ignore the past, you are threatening the future.
The windows in my room are broken.
Do you hate him so much?
I love the truth.
Why don't we go pick them up?
Please, find her.

I'm not ready yet.
This bird doesn't know how to fly.

I just saw him.
What's going to happen to us?
My home town is by the ocean.
I left home at 7:00.
How's it going, Tom?
The wind changed direction.
Please don't ask her.
I have to take them home.
No one will ever forget you.
Why didn't you call me before you came?
I can't get a single answer from Tom.
Ask me to find out this earlier.
Is anything missing?
I didn't do that for him.
She was feeling pretty lonely.
I go hunting in my free time.
Where did my driver go?
He's got a mania.
The coat is covered with fur.
Tom's ugly.
When did you buy that with Tom?
I was notified.
He was sleeping tightly.
I had no doubt about that.
Pins are made in bottles.
Tom doesn't feel that way.
Tom was sitting on the stairs talking to a girl named Mary.
I know what you did for lunch.
I always eat it.
Tom gave Mary the message from John.
Your desires are my command.
I have an apartment in Boston.
Can I ask you a question?
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
Somebody just called.
Can I show you something?
I'm not a big sailor.
My dad got a white droplet inflammation last month.
What a sad story!
Try to get a good night's sleep.
I don't think I'll live long.
You need to help her out.
They're worried about him.
Tom was not aware that Mary was hoping to kiss her.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I don't have friends.
Tom plays in a band and is very nice.
Why can't you take it?
Put the gun down.
Tom was curious.
Let's play volleyball.
Yesterday was fun.
Tom might be able to help us if we ask him nicely.
Tom likes to eat in restaurants.
Tom says he was accustomed to hospital food.
That's my problem.
I don't think she's a bitch, she's married and she's got three kids.
That was a secret, wasn't it?
I wouldn't think so.
I ate chicken medallions.
My dream has come true.
This is a wooden table.
The situation is tense.
I am also interested in Greek mythology.
The observatory has a good location.
I'm good for propaganda.

They're pretty good.
Did you admit to Tom?
Tom is a diabetic.
Call it what you want.
I'll send Tom to take care of it.
How would you fix it?
This sounds familiar to me.
Would you like to watch TV?
Sure!
They're not happy.
They were verbally abused.
Why were you chasing me?
I was pretty busy.
I couldn't do what you did.
Are you always busy?
Tom heard the noise.
You're below her level.
Wisdom is a curse when it does not help the one who owns it.
What is the origin of the universe?
Whoever calls, tell him I'm out.
I convinced Tom that he should go to Boston with Mary.
The sheep feed on grass.
Tom's gonna give up.
I didn't know you were unhappy here.
Tom resigned from the idea of going to Boston.
I didn't find anything wrong.
Tom's acting efficiently.
I should be alone.
I can take it from them.
I read Tom's story.
Why are you tired?
Tom said he'd leave at 2:30.
I'll take him with me.
It has nothing to do with luck.
I think you know the rules.
I'm sincerely sorry about that.
How are we today?
Here's your wife.
It's back at 6:00.
Let go of the people.
Tom's eyes weren't blinking.
You're a good son.
I'll get you to talk to Tom.
I'll just call them.
The lamb saw it.
I have to turn the phone off.
The weather is good.
This was misinformation.
No one wants to be around him.
Dan saw him talking to a stranger near the restaurant.
Tom did it with ease.
I know you're tired.
Why didn't you graduate?
There's a cherry in front of my house.
He's the boss of the company.
Peace at home, peace in the world.
They hate themselves.
I'm very busy getting ready for the party.
It won't get better.
He's already done his job.
My ears are tightened.
We're not worried.
Don't stay too long.
Tom lives in a boat.
Let's be creative.
You look pretty bad.
I don't want to make a lot of effort.
We went to the same church.
I arrived in Boston at two and a half.
How could Tom know?
She's in a deaf school.
You have a habit I don't like.
You sound very sure.
How desperate are you?
I don't know why I'm so stuck.
I don't want to wait.
What is it, to be invisible to him?
Radio's off.
I turned Tom down.
You should be proud.
I'm in love and confused.
I keep most of my money in the bank that is near my office.
Do you remember what happened last year?
You're going with me and a dot!
It's not worth it.
I need you to find them.
It's all going well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let's give everything we can.
I'll pay.
It's possible Tom wouldn't help us at all.
I'd rather sit down.
- Read this.
I arrived here a few minutes before you.
I'm helping him.
That's bullshit.
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary work in the same office.
Jealousy is a sin.
All the kids are strangers.
They shot me.
Tom is not inclined to drama.
I completed twenty-five projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't leave to look at us through the key.
Tea smells good.
Well, I've been exhibiting.
Do you trust them?
That column is not very vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Has anyone told you that?
Why are you calling?
They spoke quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to speak French.
We've got to go back.
That's what I mean.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little ass.
Tom believes everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going to the point.
Well, what's the goal?
Can you sign this?
He is as tall as she is.
They were chased.
I didn't believe him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much that costs?
We wanted to visit the museum together.
Oh, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were chased.
Let's go down the street.
There was no living soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging your wells.
I have a few more minutes left.
Hold on a second.
Tom loves you so much.
You're cooking well.
There is no shorter path to the top, only to the failure.
Tom's pretty weak.
Its surface was flat like a mirror.
Don't you want to keep him?
Tom's paying a lot.
It was a pity.
Looks like you care about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked them all.
Automotive cars are now distributed.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to give your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I screwed him again, Tom.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my dinner?
The Orgullar was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you're helping me.
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
She was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do as I showed you?
I'm making a cage.
I love the blue color.
The girl freed the bird.
I didn't tell you to accept the myth.
Don't suck my coffee.
Tom gave her a shabby rabbit to her daughter.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography with it, it will be done.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the guitar?
They picked her nicely.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mys, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too good to go to school.
It was a shame for me to spend the night with a smart, spiritual and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little sluggish.
The girl escapes from the house and gets rid of the control of her parents.
Tom's a spoiler.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were texting me in the evening, but you exposed me, apparently.
Guess.
He disguised himself to dip.
The river of sweat began to lay on my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just beat that up.
I'm studying mathematics.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How'd you move?
The movies are great entertainment.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love the jazz.
They're staring at you.
He'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests should we expect tonight?
She's in the hospital.
Looks like I misjudged it.
I appreciate your help with this.
They all laughed.
I didn't ask you for an opinion.
The flight was cancelled due to unfavorable weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom was sitting patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
They may be back.
I'm so scared, I'm so scared.
The whole committee is against that.
The world is illuminating the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made himself a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid the bad associations.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that booklet?
It didn't get so bad.
The tape doesn't come out.
Tom committed suicide.
Tom promised to take care of Mary.
Mary likes to drink hot coffee, and Tom likes milk.
I gave him a fake address.
I'm together.
I'm not upset anymore.
There's a good chance that Jane's coming.
I'm ugly.
I think so.
I think you're scared.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I don't care what you think of Tom.
They're starting to shoot.
Tom's getting hooked.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you invent that, Tom?
What's going to be my lawyer?
The girls are singing.
Tom recommended it to Mary.
Who were they?
Tom began to speak.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'll really try to be kind to Tom.
Tom ate it all.
Where does Tom buy?
It looked awful.
They're all liars.
How can someone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's all quiet again.
That's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Shut up.
I have a lot of problems right now.
Answer me right away.
Let me help you.
Tom's got a problem with anger.
Catch him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new person.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm stuck.
The question is whether we can or not.
Tom raced up.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I've done.
It's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you were just dating girls that were lower than you.
I need to get my belt tight.
Tom was about to meet Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some hamburgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is not a place for a three-year-old.
I know how to ski.
He built a new house.
I didn't expect you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I'm sleeping standing.
I'm weaker.
The cake looks nice.
Did someone break your heart? No.
That's how I feel.
What's bothering you?
We want to see Tom.
Where'd you get Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please, come on in time.
The Germans have a lesser attitude towards the ballot.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's sleeping.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they put his body in a large tomb.
Women love men with pussies.
Did you forget your wallet again?
Do you accept a kiss?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do that, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
The two of them crawled.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this one?
I didn't have any luck.
His body was stained with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I was very angry with Tom.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now come in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's going to help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always wanted more and more mysterious characters.
Throw my ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's the fore with a hat?
Tom is one of the most prominent American poets.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom promised he'd never come back here again.
No one likes to cry.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the far mountain.
I missed the match.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's pretty fucked.
Try to explain that to Tom.
We were the first to arrive.
I've already given her your number.
My soap burned my eyes.
I'm glad to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary very much.
Tom tasted the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We're starting to talk.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the right way.
I know I can do more.
You learn fast.
We ate a lot of good food.
Tom has been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I've been kicked.
No one's gonna bore you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look through the window.
Mary buys smelly garbage bags.
I suffer from asthma.
He gets used to working in the garden for two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom suffered from malaria while traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're very strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
It's good to remember.
Is he able to do whatever he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We're bringing them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I planned to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who did not speak French.
Why did he go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is not yet fully aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
Looks like you already know the answer.
Could you take us with you?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who is the owner of the ship?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
It was of great benefit to us.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I'll come to save you.
I got a stone in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked up.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was slenderly brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I'm never looking for handcuffs.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go into my room.
That's where we started.
I didn't want to thank you.
There was no need to speak.
I'm hurting my wrist.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the mail with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got a couple of crabs.
I'm learning French.
Let me not see you.
It was too late.
I live on the lowest floor.
The girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was thoughtless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to make them stop.
I enjoyed Tom's sensitivity.
We've got to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You're not gonna need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's just leave it alone.
I never wear clothes.
The gravel's broken.
He's gone.
Its clients are largely poor people.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's awful.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women love men with pussies.
We spent the afternoon silly on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People are constantly dying.
That guy's perfect for him.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
Take your sword out.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom didn't like to go.
Tom seems a little depressed in the morning.
No one understands me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom's got his ass kicked out.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss this topic with you.
Did he ask them for money?
Don't talk so loudly.
She works in a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We were supposed to buy another bottle of wine.
Add the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and politely presented himself.
That's one reason.
Give me the book, I need it again.
Mark thinks he's writing.
Tom looked up.
My ears are ringing.
I'm taking the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very tidy.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such an asshole!
Who makes breakfast for him?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn't want to go down.
Tom was suspended.
They laughed.
She'll be a teacher.
I'm not going to tell Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was awful.
Tom looks awkward.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That’s all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we can find help in the nearest village.
We hope it's okay.
You're capable, but you're forgetting.
He's been working at the embassy three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this yourself.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's angry.
It's from work.
We'll meet up.
Congratulations encourage students to work destructively.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the door from the car.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom is about thirty years old.
What's the deal?
I see how upset you are.
All right, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make a deal for you.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom measured his weight.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom has changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "lady" was used only for nobility.
Tom has been teaching French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak on your own behalf.
Do you believe that?
How to choose only one person?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My cousin uncle was there, stretched on a bleeding bed, with a skull deep in his heart.
Somebody's trying to kill us.
They pay me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long will you stay with us?
You must be very proud.
He used to be so funny.
Could you stay a little while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed him, Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I'm listening to your child's laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are doing something.
Just leave us at rest.
Tom's pretty slim.
Tom usually wins in debates.
You can handle this.
Have you heard the thunderstorms?
Do not confuse work and pleasure.
Now I work in Boston.
Put a crown on the king's head.
Tom kept his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent is unlocked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing stops us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got out of the couch.
Don't make him mad, Tom.
I turned on the fan and pointed it to the wall.
This is a homemade jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
Police found Tom's body in a plastered grave behind the plaster.
Tom writes very well.
That's not exactly true.
The rats are small.
Please, stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you water.
Let him lie like a dog.
I'm bored of Boston.
Tom had a strong headache.
As soon as I saw him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank borrowed <0x24>1 million from the company.
I have a lot more to tell you.
I always write down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I'll do my best to destroy it.
Play more relaxed.
My son always interrupts me while I talk.
This Tom's ringing.
I'll drive alone.
Looks like I drank too much last night, it's my head.
Tom was doing it.
Tom said he didn't care what the guy's name was.
I'm gonna hit your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I am interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have to lend me an interesting book?
Tom was cautious.
Just get in there.
It's a steel sword.
I moved to a new house last week, and yesterday I studied the library.
I told myself my own.
You're ridiculous.
Is that all we need?
Tom shaved his nose.
When do we see you?
I promise you I won't do anything that hurts you.
Tom's one.
The woman called the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
There were so many more of them than we were.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't trust you.
What did you want to see, Tom?
I'm so scared.
Dan's angry.
I don't even know what it is.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't stand it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool in which Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me in front of the mail.
What college did you study at?
It's about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him again.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It did a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just got in.
He broke a blood vessel in my eye.
That's where Mary visited yesterday.
She's exaggerating!
There's a son who's gone.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have the impression that the show will be cancelled; they didn't sell much cards.
Tom's coming.
Tom thinks he should not use deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl fell asleep.
Go write a home-writing.
Do not force your child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're laughing.
Tom paid me.
My goal is to read books.
They killed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom seems to be sloppy.
Go to bed, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very hot.
We always have to support our children.
Everyone has their own flaws.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What are we doing with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to prepare Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I feel like it's raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look annoyed?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful to you.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one suitcase less than me, they complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're awful.
Where does he live at all? Somewhere in Eastern Europe.
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in oranges.
Tom's here to help.
Too much time has passed.
I had a hamster named Cooky.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he'd be hunting the butterfly.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're very lonely.
Please do not add any comments.
That was Tom's only mistake.
Do you remember what you wore when I met you?
Lightning is usually accompanied by thunderstorms.
Tom likes citrus tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I've got a little fever.
Tom cornered him to the ground.
The lecture has no end!
The glasses are in the cupboard.
Give us some time.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to flirt with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time to change.
You should wear a helmet while driving a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eva are best friends.
I'm just as strong as you.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the psychiatrist.
How come you still don't sleep?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's not able to do that.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned the trash.
We've both seen him.
That would be uncultural.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a well-known conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my colleagues is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropics.
I think I made a good statement.
I'm replacing it.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this great?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm in a relationship with my ex-boyfriend again.
Just do this thing.
I think Tom is wonderful.
Tom got a little cake.
What's Tom doing?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knows how to play tennis, but he doesn't want to.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down.
I was thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way she holds her head reminds me of Mary.
Don't interfere with my path.
We're looking for them now.
My shoes are swollen.
Tom would have returned.
She always works well.
In which country are you a citizen?
The trade in ivory is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet Tom.
I like dogs more than cats.
There is still a little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary has been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still doesn't know how to swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know he cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the dad.
You know what I need.
You can't stand the heat.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you urgently.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have a broken pair.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't want it that way.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Go on with the job.
When are you closing?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I can't handle this task.
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go looking for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to the party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree is sailing.
We'll keep in touch.
We'll be doing it together soon.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary yelling at John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to bother him.
Tom never sits long.
Go with the sticks.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everybody was talking.
How proud I am of you.
Tom was looking for the fics in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll beat you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
It's louder.
The forest was silent.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was suppressed.
We play with destiny.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to go soon.
Tom doesn't know how to sympathize.
There's still some tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a Religion or a Philosophy?
The noise bothered me.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I can't sleep. I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a pop.
I'd like to see an order.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is he like that, Tom?
I have problems with the sinuses.
I had low expectations from him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's running out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's skillfully handling a saw.
Turn it off.
I don’t share my real name on any website.
They beat the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but I seem to be wrong.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been coming back for a week, up and down.
It slowly recovers from the disease.
I want a wristband.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really pissed.
Let Tom talk to you.
I know you still love Tom.
Retreat from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly is on the ceiling.
Her face was tortured with sperm.
Tom's fair.
You have to do this first.
We met around noon.
Nothing's been done to me tonight.
Get him a drink.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
You know what that looks like?
Just pretend you've won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was ugly and irresponsible, so he was ordered to leave the firm.
I'd figure out anything from you.
Tom is trying to become a teacher.
I wish you a lovely week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom's gotta go now.
Why did God make me so disgusted?
Why do you blame them?
You're overpriced.
We're acting childish.
Tom was a boss.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom climbed up.
Let's go out and talk.
Alcohol is the answer. I don't know what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what you've just started.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Shayka dumped the tyre.
We made ourselves wood.
This is much better.
I'm gonna make her cut your lawn.
Tom is good at mathematics.
Tom pulled his money out of the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You need to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with my kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're a brook.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
I know how much it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate steak and steak.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom was trying to help me.
They've filled the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think it's weird just because it's not protein.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was last night.
That's so awful.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't argue that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't get any benefit from that.
It's still not valid.
Give me an example.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Was he honest?
The philanthropy was empty.
Don't collect.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't leave.
It's close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire lived in the dead ark.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be handed over?
Tom has a bruise in his eye.
Tom's company is under threat.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you.
Is that true?
I know you're mad.
When I left in the morning, Tom was still in pyjamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom is dipped.
Tom took a picture.
Tom thought Mary would be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me smile.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money for me right now.
“You’re a vegetarian, aren’t you?”
A lightning strikes the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
That's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your dad was dead.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never get there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom has work to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in a horoscope?
I know how to go.
I'm contributing.
It was a real disaster!
Tom is good at his job.
I've figured it out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom prepared all of this.
I'm not gonna betray her.
Flowers are attracted to bees.
The water is mild.
There was no plant life at this time of the day.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom's answer?
You will do as I command you.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did the right thing.
Tom's a long way off.
Tom wants to write.
Tom's very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I have a lot of interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not a scientist at that.
She's got tight heels.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The poet and the poet travel together.
There's no time for explanations.
Are they gonna arrest me?
It breaks all the rules.
What are you doing here, mother?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Come on, beer.
A certain Mr. Kimura is waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are men of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom wasn't playing fair.
The wound releases dirt.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't resist.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must be feeling lonely.
What did you ask for on the internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly on the move.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw the paperwork at Mary's office.
Tom did this.
I'm studying art history.
I don't really agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's a lot more.
Looks like these two are in a relationship again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
It is a moral choice for the translator to translate something or not. Certain things are better left in the language they produced.
You're nasty.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom for permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
You gonna eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look.
Give me the French key.
Tom sounds worried.
It was a session.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun constantly varies.
That's what Tom just told me.
Tom looked Mary deep into his eyes and smiled.
It was very thick in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all right.
The stars are shining.
- Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's a white man.
Tom could do better.
I didn't call you for that, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
You should have found them.
I couldn't presuppose.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be known over time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait anymore.
I thought Tom would be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don’t have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're squirming.
We're gonna go shopping.
Tom knew that Mary would like John.
Tom's a butcher.
I just slit my finger.
I'll go ask Tom.
I've got a headache.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
Someone might have followed her.
My wife was here once.
It's a drug in powder.
We went to the shore.
I don't want you to harass them.
It depends on your decision.
That's feasible.
Tom reacted badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was measuring you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut-off.
Aren't you a banker?
She was very pleased to have met her granddaughter.
That's our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom's in a hurry.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom caught a fire extinguisher and started squirming.
It's for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak on your own behalf.
It resulted in a lot of difficulties.
She slowly developed hatred for me.
I don't think that's the case.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are irrational to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't resist.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's stuck.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your handbag!
And so our conscience really makes us all cowards.
You don't have to panic.
I gave him one of them.
I don’t expect anything less than perfection.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should've checked.
He couldn't get his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You're wrong.
We're glad to see you.
Now you have the courage to leave, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom went to Boston.
The screen emits green light.
English has become my favorite subject.
The work has happened quickly.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up in the morning, we were faced with terrible news.
The knee wound is now pounding.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary was frightened.
It's not your business!
Tom wouldn't touch anything.
Tom is an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying it.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
How long has Tom been sleeping?
Our job is to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a menthol candy?
Why would he do that to us, Tom?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to stay overnight here.
I'd almost cut myself.
I'm going down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
Blood now burst into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't a man that was easy to deal with.
I don't like pork.
She wants to run.
I need a sea nut.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom read the note.
The children painted pictures on the sidewalk with a cradle.
You're wondering what you've been up to.
Did you get an answer from him?
I should take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I've been to Boston twice.
Tom was married at the age of 26.
We've cleared that already.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We play with the computer.
No, it's not even under the capital.
Tom and I are friends for drinks.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's listening to something.
Tom always tries to act the way he thinks it is right.
Tom often doesn't seem to understand what's going on.
Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She wants to boast of the magnificent chandeliers she has in the house.
I'm not a local.
What's on the plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's happening right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm studying piano.
They need the money.
He's swimming well.
You won't find us.
I've heard from her.
You don't get involved in this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I watched TV when Tom arrived.
You don't follow.
Do you think you'll be able to stop me?
Actually, it's very frequent.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Didn't I do something to get Tom mad at me?
The triangles do not have four angles.
There is not enough light to read.
Tom is counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turns her armor off.
Oh, guess what.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
Where I asked.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everybody's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon's coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me up as soon as it breaks apart.
Mr. Gorbachev, break the wall!
Tom looks stunned.
Tom's up.
It's the way it should be.
Let's try to get together.
It's gonna be hard.
I don't feel good about retirement.
Thank you for the question.
I have a good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll investigate that right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
Rooms are closed.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should not have been sent at all.
The girl who wears a joke is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you doing?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Is that my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so affectionate.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's not an emergency.
I'll pick her up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll come by subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
I'm not Tom's favorite.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom goes to school by car.
Did you watch?
I'm gonna have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Are you writing the lyrics?
It was a great series.
We need to go find them.
Last time I was home on Friday night when I was thirteen.
Tom knows that Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take the hat off.
I don't know what you think will change.
I do that for him.
You can trust her.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
He just gave me a blowjob.
What did Tom find now?
We've been up all night trying to figure out a plan.
Tom's annoyed.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom is well armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said we should stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them so much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I've got a glass of beer to saturate my thirst.
Tom arrived in time.
TV is boring today.
Oh, that's great!
Tom found a four-leaf deer.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She's quitting smoking.
Tom found the evidence.
We started to say goodbye to them.
Didn't you smoke?
All visitors must be inspected.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nothing and nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in the 1990s.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds quite valid.
It's the law!
The water pierced the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please, write it down.
Tom's here for sure.
I can stay.
I don’t see any complaints from customers.
Here, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on the couch.
I was supposed to do that yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Beware of the sparks flying out of the fire.
It's just invented.
Tom's been taunting Mary all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I always dream of you.
Let's find out more about her.
I'm not gonna tell anyone about your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get the soul together.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam as close as possible.
We're going to Boston.
Tom's a good dad.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her in his mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three cans of bubble spray.
It was disgusting.
You owe me nothing.
Tom turned into a wolf.
I bought these medicines for my dad.
Kids love cakes.
He was quite restrained.
I can go out with Tom.
Tom's nervous.
This is from us.
In case of emergency, what number should I call?
I still love the horse.
I didn't touch him.
Who's right here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary picked up Tom's money.
Enough of the nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom has always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
It looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started to hook up.
Butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
I would like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom was out of work earlier.
We have everything.
I baked him some cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the start.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say goodbye?
How many instruments do you know how to play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last.
I haven't found them yet.
I'm being ignored.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be fakes.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom's incompetent.
The girl weakened him.
It's over between me and Tom.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
He left me in despair.
Tom screaming awakened from a nightmare.
Tom's got a bad look.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it ready?
Everyone wants a lasting peace.
We met a day ago.
Where'd you get Tom?
Is the coffee hard?
Tom opened his eyes.
The tribe was not happy that a peacemaker came.
Open it.
Put on a blanket.
You may be wrong.
I baked the cake as well.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my advisors about what items to take.
I’ve already written everything I needed to write.
Make sure you don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe that Tom was the one who stole Mary's wheel.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room below this?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it, so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my bedtime schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the couch.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen him?
Tom wasn't sure of anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll take you.
I set him up, Tom.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in his ear.
Tom knows he's very revengeful.
I've seen it happen.
We'll miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like that before.
You're such a bitch.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Datoeba really too slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you call me on Google?
Emotions are contagious.
I just took a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back on his own.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We are mannequins.
What do you want?
Tom's got a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack up.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
Tom still plays golf, right?
I overeat today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was fascinating.
I can't see anything.
He's a pretty unpleasant man!
They broke their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems to be jealous.
Tom took the picture down from the wall and hung another one in that place.
Stop! Stop!
You want cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are not clear at all.
That was very negligible by Tom.
It's a duck.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got mad.
Let them smell you.
Burning is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom's on the inside.
At the same time, you are both heavy and light, and pleasant and bitter; I cannot live with or without you.
Let's say for now that you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I'm not listening to anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm here.
That disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
If only I could understand.
Tom's a homeless man.
I guess most of them have gone home.
It's hard to explain.
We didn't miss you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look like each other.
Don't forget him.
We have to find them first.
I'm running an account.
Tom hit Mary in the head with a towel.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better get both of us to sleep.
I'm always confusing those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
The report is very foreword-written.
You need to help them.
Tom didn't cry.
I wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom turns the hook.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I see ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
There is nothing worse than stupidity and indifference.
All three of them.
Tom wasn't protesting.
What are the websites from?
The vampires live forever.
Both of them smiled.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
You're sympathetic.
I hate ducks.
I didn't say I did that.
He wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Changes are never easy.
Is Boston far away?
They pay me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he'd be able to prepare it by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston by plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'm going to say goodbye to that later in the afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was going to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the cap out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
The guard's coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that was hung on the bucket.
The gulabi symbolizes peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I will do everything for the good of humanity.
Did you really stay home all night?
Enja's music is beautiful.
Is she a taxi driver?
I'm losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm sleeping.
It has not been scientifically proven that there is a link between the character and the blood group.
She sounded mad.
Honestly, Tom wasn't working hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom is brave.
Avoid tobacco smoking too much.
Tom's a freezer.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing on the computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We've been looking for them everywhere.
I really like your website very much.
I'll catch you.
Press the button on it.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom broke his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All squirrels carry eggs.
We'll take something.
I think Tom's rude.
You didn't answer my letter.
We've calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad, do you like it?
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things are.
I'm making a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move on to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, come out.
His words sounds reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have a hole.
A lot of trees have collapsed.
Lions do not distinguish colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer is ugly.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look over here.
I want you to give me my money back now.
Tom thought Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you, please?
Tom and I are now married.
I guess we've both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary is doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed that he didn't have his wallet.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
My right ear swells.
The cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
They don't get names.
It's a fairy.
I'm here to learn.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm hanging the calendar on the wall.
I really missed him.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their suitcases.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They didn't throw a curse.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn him around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
Butterflies live a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom sleeps very hard.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk to me later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I'm running.
Did you get here by car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure.
Can you just wait a minute?
You're among friends.
You're weakening something.
I know you don't speak French.
Did she call him?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start all over again.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for welcoming me.
Susan's actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer eggs from the bottom.
Can you explain that to me?
Where's his house?
Love is for the insane.
Why would I help him?
Tom lighted his shoes.
We have lost our faith in humanity.
Tom is dealing with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why do we all hate us?
Tom, borrow me some money.
Am I bothering you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Look how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom can't talk to us yet.
They'll be very happy with that.
I'm Peder.
Let's see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Can I honor you for dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I'm supposed to look.
Come down, Dick, it's time for dinner.
I'm chasing.
He was driving fast.
You can take care of my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He whispered to the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in his mailbox.
Come on in.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses this month.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you already paid for it?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom shaved his face.
What benefit do I get from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more than you.
We don't have to follow her.
I got burned when she was wearing that clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
They live on the floor below this one.
They believed him.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but not the button.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a type of mammals.
It's red.
Tom didn't put me in.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like a science fiction?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm going out to eat.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
It narrows the choice.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to take care of his child.
I signed the word "Alice" to highlight it.
The third luck.
We need to get rid of it.

No one said anything.
Let us strive for the virtues and give up the evils.
You're clear.
I'm against projects.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom was listening to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm late.
I could have known that Tom was really tired.
I'll never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There's some writing reports.
It hurts here.
You're annoying Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just taunting you.
Tom's never showed up again.
My advice would be to go to sleep now and finish tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Diseases often occur at the most inappropriate time.
The dog looks at me like he wants to eat me.
They were animals dressed in human skin, and they weren't real people at all.
The man is starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
It’s all gone, but the good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom think?
It was really nice.
Everybody dies sometime.
I know how to stay calm.
We love the beauty.

Tom told me a secret.
We fly over the clouds.
I like it so much!
Is this just in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom gave Mary a towel.
She's got ears like big.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't know exactly how to answer the question.
This is a jelly drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's missing from your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary would say.
I don't like how that sounds at all.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try it.
I'm not misunderstood,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I guess you've read my report.
Tom retreated.
Don't repeat yourself.
The skulls are bloody.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look great.
It's an accident, Tom.
Heat it.
Tom seemed to be angry.
What else can Tom do?
I want to be physically and mentally stronger.
She's a lively girl.
If I could stay, I would stay.

He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.

You're my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two rows.
The titles should attract the attention of the readers.
She was sitting in front of me.
He'd die first than I'd obey.
I'm actually working here.
Tom is suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like how you're dressed.
I could stay with you.

Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother tells me that the child's diseases are false.
Dan had a busy relationship with Linda.
They're all back.

What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do a socially beneficial job to be recompensed for everything I have done.

Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know what you're saying?
It hurts awful here.
I hate carpets.
I'm a little sick.
Tom interrupted him.
Tom could not remember where he had left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.

It looks like home.
I'm not even sure I remember right.
Tom noticed how Mary looked at him.
You're pissing me off.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
The Eagle is the King of Birds.
I'll call you later.
This is bullshit.
Why don't you rest?
You don't ask why.
Tom didn’t sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky is wide open.
The stool will wake the baby.
Just look straight.
It’s not something a man should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary play remixes.
I've decided.
Take care of our planet.
Tom relied on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think I'd rather have a son.
How did you get here?
She started the book.
Don't take my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do that.
Tom also read Mary's secret diary.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked for two hours.
He told me about you.
I know you're upset right now.
He's gone.
After a long walk, he had an appetite.
I have to go and help her.
Tom's served with a cup of tea and a cup of coffee.
Tom could tell you.
There's just no way I'm gonna make Tom swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
The two of them smiled again.
The wedding has to be perfect for me.
Tom felt very strong.
The meeting has already begun.
We want to hear it.
I really like what your hair looks like.
Did you study outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom is in danger.
He is addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair's broken.
Tom is the tallest man in the class.
Tom, you're growing up fast.
That was our only comfort.
No one was going to care about him.
Did you write in a diary today?
I just want this to never happen to us again.
Can I do it alone?
Is it your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to sneak through the key, but couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I have known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you curving?
Come on, Tom.
I'm going to try to get there on time.
No one's come here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
Up and down, we're ready.
Tom has an acute hearing.
I bought them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom’s books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't pull the tape.
I helped him unlock the table.
I ate potato chips last night.
It's better for your health to climb the stairs.
Tom bought the coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is ugly.
I'm sorry I told them something at all.
I wouldn't have asked you to find someone else.
Gather me in two and a half.
Tom boiled.
I slept on the bill.
Somehow I enjoyed it.
That's exactly what it can do.
Aren't your short sleeves cold?
Tom is the best.
He has an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever had in my life.
I need an envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any real Japanese movies?
Did you catch them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife confirm her guilt.
Can I wait for them here?
We can search for a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe he didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I baked you cookies.
It can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I sent Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun to go to the party.
Don't save the bell.
He stabbed me in the head.
You gotta be careful.
Tom seems to be stopped.
You're having fun, you're continuing your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
How come you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
It smells bad for the month.
So do I need to know you?
Tom wisely concealed all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I guess it doesn't matter.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
In the picture there are bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just leased Tom's room last week.
Tom does not sleep in a dead ark, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell a dog if it were higher.
I'm going to help my buddies.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a clown.
We despise her.
He came in front of them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom sent the new fly that he had just bought on the table.
Tom's going to help Mary.
She grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's pissed.
The landscape is superb.
It's locked.
I found your dads under the bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test it.
The freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'm going to try to narrow myself down.
Autumn has arrived.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the traffic to happen?
It only takes three minutes to boil the water.
I could be fired for this.
What's the point?
Tell me where to find it.
You're drunk!
It was so majestic.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to enroll in a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are gifted with reason and conscience and should treat each other in the spirit of general human affiliation.
What happened was an accident. It was an accident.
This building has a masonry.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do it alone.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup is salted.
Why aren't you going to pick him up?
Tom continued to exercise.
Try to figure it out.
It won't cost you anything to fix.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom stared at the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend, don't you see how poor I am?
It seems familiar to me.
I'm jealous of him.
I offered him to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
They have their own limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Bosilot, saffron, rosemary, thyme and oregano are popular herbs.
We're ugly.
You're a pervasive man.
Everything seemed to be fine.
Leave this in here.
He was sitting on the couch.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
So somehow I'm even flattered.
Exercise.
She may have overtaken you, but I'm not!
Let's just get the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
They got me.
Tom stretched out his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a shopkeeper.
It's just to solve this task.
They have to remove the bullet that was stuck to his back.
Epten's funny.
Does Tom look annoyed?
If you can, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunscreen.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect admits.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
Looks like you don't know how it hurts to beat you.
We are importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but here he did it.
Tom's not here because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
The scrubbers don't help against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
Looks like he's not coming in to ask Tom.
My brother's coming in tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are the potatoes caloric?
They'll get it soon.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary to the tail.
I broke the vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'll go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't hit you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him make makeup.
I've been waiting outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and grow up a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom was shooting me with a stone.
Everybody knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom's gonna be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They were standing under the street in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I remember a number of reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
I'm the best to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
Some of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
It's a beautiful jacket.
I like your coffee.
They all doubted.
I still think of her.
Today I learned that there is a movie called “Russians are coming! Russians are coming!”
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Oh, thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still unable to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'll pay.
How many more days before Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I don't care about that.
Tom has a collection of grandma's.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
You got enough?
The deaf are the carriers of the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's out.
I'll start tomorrow.
I wasn't being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I don't know how to write so well.
The king did not predict the fall of the monarchy.
I'm scared of Tom.
I like baked bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving, causing a traffic jam.
They listened to us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was so wonderful.
Tom greets Mary with a whisper.
That's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is the camera used?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Be careful not to overdo it.
Tom's an accountant.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, I don't understand German.
It will take about three hours to get out of the mountain.
I'm just starving.
They disqualified me.
Did you finish the packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would he do that, Tom?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get involved.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You're too much for him.
The president said the United States would launch a satellite in orbit.
I can't lend you a book.
It's impossible to get out of the cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early?
Sounds very loud.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Take care, Tom.
Tom tied his wrinkles.
I can't turn it off.
We weren't supposed to stay awake until 2:30.
You're really right.
You think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in the United States did not have the right to vote.
My neighbor called a firefighter.
Tom said I need to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom does not listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is that all the excitement?
Tom decided to go somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm clock is ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It's an unspeakable fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky's ugly.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom's a little upset.
I'm at the airport.
I'd rather be black.
Tom surrendered to his destiny.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogota, and Osaka is similar to Medellín.
Did you stop kicking your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't Tom stop?
I said I'd bring him.
Survivors are a kind of mammals.
I'll start.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big bowl.
If I know Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where does the bull go?
I wiped my wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies to a child, he thinks he’s always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
I might not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled the screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy the sentences.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the paravana.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do everything.
Tom moved on to the next question.
That was obvious.
I want life.
Tom's not in his bed.
That was all my idea.
I don't want puzzles.
This book will help you to write well.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I thought you weren't gonna be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her. Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
Please, swing out the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates laughed at her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he had already seen Mary in the morning.
In the morning, I cut my toasts with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to get strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go and help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom dumped his girlfriend.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's excited.
I almost wouldn't have come.
I made a cake.
Look at the number.
I really liked your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn everything off.
Tom's been busy.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hey, how are you?
Last month I had a bladder infection.
Look at the girls.
I'm gonna get the cylinder off.
That's exactly what happened, too.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate the foreign languages.
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What benefits do we have from that?
I am with the person I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
“How are you?” “Okay, thank you.”
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed of himself.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a fast-paced one.
Goods are broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were purely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has a lot of good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You need to eat more.
Tom's not good for sports.
Shouldn't we help them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom feels that he needs to be redeemed.
It's up to them.
When will I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom raised the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'll say.
I'm not your shoulder.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not friends.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious business.
Mars is the red planet.
He stabbed the dog with a stone.
Tom stared steadily.
It's seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try it.
So I wrote the book!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be imaginary.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom was drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were satisfied.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you have to exhale it.
Tom's not doing well today.
We can't see.
Mahmoud can't stand to lose.
No one's listening to you.
All right, convince me.
I'm ready for him now.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hatred usually go together.
Tom didn't know that had happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd have come to you.
I agreed.
Tom confessed to spilling the red wine.
You want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited Laura's castles.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think of him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'd love to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff's here.
Stay as long as your soul wants.
Catch me for a hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who'd know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He is very pedantic in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
You're not alone.
I remember he was in Boston for a short time.
How much belly should I do per day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turns to go.
Tom's kind.
How was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and see a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate to do this.
Dan turned himself into a questioner.
You have a lot of eyes.
Isn't that implied?
I thought I was tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom go back to work.
I want you all to shoot them.
I think I write pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Let's get in there.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems to be rich.
Tom seems to be reliable.
Do you want to drink water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the quantity is not accurate.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
The squares have four angles.
I kept working.
It develops addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll wait there.
Can you check on those?
Give them a second.
They were sitting and silent.
Bring the blade.
You have a lot of different types of people here.
Mary snuck into her mother.
Pick one.
What do you want with me?
No one was listening to Tom.
You want me to get something from the supermarket?
The mission's over.
Tom wiped the knife from his diapers.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them turned to me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Do you bleed the nails?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer jar on the barbecue.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
He pointed to me with a convincing look.
Come on, don't be ashamed.
I don't want to eat meat from cloned animals.
How far did you go?
My dad's very strict.
Maybe I'd better go back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'll just buy another one.
Will you get rid of it?
Give him a dollar.
Did he have an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how it is possible.
He looked at me through his glasses.
Linda stabbed Dan to death.
Why would it bother them?
Let's not stop Tom.
The rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I got an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
Here's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to be fair.
I need to get rid of him.
Why is the sky blue?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who could break the aquarium?
It came through my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression for several periods of his life.
Can I get your bags?
I'd trust my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What do you have to worry about?
I need a dinner.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who was his French teacher.
Look at the class.
There were penguin footprints on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a slipper.
I want to shave my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It’s obvious to everyone that he’s in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move it.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not enthusiastic.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a small town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the results of the exam?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was eating something.
She's studying English.
With such a luxurious dream, he will either become a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate it.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even call me.
We'll survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We're going to visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom broke the chewing tyre.
Let it be mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who's recommending that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to get bad habits!
She's starting to behave strangely.
They're probably not going to pay the money back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how her interest in archaeology was born.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
He was eating meat at the time.
You always misunderstand me.
We're just as strong with you.
The president looked very strong.
What should I buy?
Tom went to the window and looked out.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was a Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me out.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are frightened enough, anything can happen.
You're a small town.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's got his neck stuck.
Hold on to the day.
What's Tom calling?
He's very handsome.
Take care of the buyer.
Tom often runs for hours.
Now it's time for compensation.
Most virgins have a whole hymn.
You can come out at the end.
Why did you just rinse two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint, and when I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus stopped, we waited a long time for the rain.
You'll be fine.
Does she have a dog?
I'm resting.
Mary was wearing fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to crawl to something like that.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was speaking a French suburb than he was actually speaking.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture, so the orator was supposed to speak slower.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are swollen.
This medicine calms the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please, accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look silly.
His mother is American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't know each other.
The sponge began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
This means we can't eat it any more.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fusherski did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom looked annoyed.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my decision, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It works well.
Tom got badly sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom's always liked you.
Now we're never gonna find out.
Should we wait here for him?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got fucked up.
I'd rather be a goat cheese than a cow.
We understand that.
How's that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Are they all having fun?
I've been awake all night.
I have an unfinished job with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know he's with you.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was weird.
The stools cut wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zini to the end.
Single-sex couples should not be able to get married.
The cow forgot that she was a calf.
Give them a picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sculpture is a handmade work.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister pulling the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you turn off the cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why would I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a taxi driver.
There is no trace of Tom's voice yet.
I was home then.
Don't hit me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies are creating other lies.
I don't have any more money.
The chair is plastic.
Sunlight is said to be the best disinfectant.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always soulless.
They're serious.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very useful.
You're hanging me out.
Did you call an ambulance already?
Bring it after lunch, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
The red light's on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Today, the first snow fell.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did he bet?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
The blood circulates through the body.
I'm gonna make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
They won't help the lies.
My thumb hurts on my right leg.
The apple is healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them gifts.
What would the Prince want?
Where do we come from? Where did we go?
I really don't know.
Do you have a scarf?
Tom bakes for attention.
Dan had no sympathy for any human beings.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawings.
Their houses were built out of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this right now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed to be so happy.
I don't speak English, but I speak Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't think about things like that.
There's wind.
I'm just kidding you.
I don't know where it is.
We've all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
And I bought a watch.
Just sit there.
Tom barely knows how to go.
Didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the whole team.
At what age did you start menstruating?
You're annoying me.
But not in front of the court.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not a big deal.
You were right, guys.
It's happening.
There were no other wounded.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Are you going to eat at home or outside?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get worse.
Are you laughing at me?
I think I know him.
I'm drinking milk.
Don't make him angry, Tom.
It's a difficult task.
You need to make him listen.
I was surprised that it was so easy.
I wish he was here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom often calls to Mary.
Thank you, darling.
They expanded the territory of the kingdom.
I'm not here to hurt people.
Tom must have already known about it.
My mother's sister is my aunt.
I've been looking for them everywhere.
Tom's incompetent.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny that.
It went red.
I gotta go.
Anyone who sleeps with dogs wakes up with bullies.
His aunt is alone in London.
It's not a big miracle.
I feel bad.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe it'll turn out tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom's got a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Hey, listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him in your name.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these tips in mind.
His statement is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Take your things off.
Where'd you put it?
Tom can't accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get from that?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't too busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for one person.
You don't have to be present for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin that.
You're very passionate.
I've had my headache.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
You want me to ask him?
Give it to Tom.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really so beautiful?
Hey, let's not be your fault.
Isn't that unusual?
I got out of the wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom has to be stopped.
Isn't that too much?
They know what happened.
Tom took the joke off his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower was in ruins.
Tom is a great materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little.
Did you read it?
I thought you might be interested to find out.
Give me the stickers.
The hawks love cold weather.
This is a little loose on my waist.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Did you forgive me already?
Did Tom know?
Would I lie to you, Tom?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid to lose money.
Tom swallowed the belly.
Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his dad so much.
Let's go upstairs.
It's not that we're doing something.
Tom went well today.
Milton hasn't slept well in a week.
When is the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning to stay with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's no secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you doing?
Now this is your house.
How about you try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I'm feeling better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing just what I want.
It's not my decision.
In spite of our expectations, there were no accusations.
Desire is one of the seven deadly sins.
Tom is irresponsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw that Mary was about to say something.
I won't be in town next week.
They sowed seed, and they grew it, and they reaped it; and the brooks of the brooks turned into streams.
He hates his dad.
Tom helped us get out of here.
Tom was in an accident.
Tom took Mary home.
I ski often.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm just as qualified as Tom.
When will I get my turn?
Tom failed.
I'm a new student.
The baby's sleeping.
How rich is Tom?
Obviously it's a printed error.
It’s not often that someone buys a <0x24>1,000 hat.
Is the police coming?
We have to find him first.
Dan laughed at the assistants with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I barely saved myself from being caught.
I'm not allowed to interfere.
You beat them.
They were silent.
Tom's back soon.
I'd be in favor.
History is written by the winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when it exploded.
Who's going to make up for the cyanide?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing bothers me here.
You cheated on me.
That's for sin.
Nothing's holy.
Tom seems to be pretty proud of himself.
Actually, no one knows.
Give me the blade.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're cracking it.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted that way.
I was in three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have a fish for dinner tonight.
I don't eat in restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost here.
Isgelda, you have an infection.
There's nothing smarter to me.
The sky is red in the dark.
I'm here to wish you luck.
I'd love to see you, too.
They must be happy.
We've got to fix this.
I don't speak English badly.
We'll deal with that.
The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who won them?
Dan understood this very well.
You want a cake?
Who brought this?
I told him when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan might have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.
It's hot here in hell.
I overlooked that.
This is your business!
Please come back to me.
Study here.
Congratulations on the wedding.
Kids, stay here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Is your dog licking?
That's great.
The palace has a high tower.
Kids have homework.
Let's go get 'em together.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom's gone away.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did that.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I don't mind if you leave.
Tom alone came here.
I forgot my joke.
We've suffered a lot.
Tom wanted everyone to think he was dead.
Scientific research often requires a lot of compromises.
Tom just got his prostheses removed.
I have to try to find him.
I took care of that.
Tell me the details.
Are you busy with something?
Go wake Mary up.
You almost missed it.
I hate that pipe.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you as you are.
It's funny.
Very relaxed.
Keep your guns ready to go.
We had our own reasons.
His reputation was in jeopardy.
Ask me not to do that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why doesn't anyone want to help us?
The hole's tight.
You should go and help him.
Do you enjoy it?
I had a great night.
Tom was in the cottage.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you at the tremor.
It's nice of him to wear such gifts.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or they'll kick you out.
Get away from me.
Let's get started!
How long is the road?
I'm fine, thank you!
Don't be late for tomorrow's meeting.
That's the message.
It's starting to fade.
Tom is educated.
I'm surprised Tom left with Mary.
He is blind from birth.
The book contains fifteen biographies.
Tom's been working all night.
Tom was just here.
I gave up.
How long have you been waiting?
Socks and shoes are new.
I haven't eaten pizza in a while.
Something wouldn't make me happy anymore.
I suggest you learn more.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
Tom is buried in Boston.
Tom's not my cousin.
What's Tom talking about now?
How are you two?
Dalida died of overdose with sleeping pills.
His opinions are invaluable.
Sign down, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know that Tom lived in Boston?
I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do something that will remind them that you're not really big enough to be here.
I got the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a slut.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
Oh, my God, it's back.
Ish, you pussy!
They flew into the water.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom's speaking French better than you think.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass mosaic.
Tom didn't come home at all last night.
I think we ate enough.
This is very difficult for them.
The witches don't cry.
Tom taught me how to make pancakes.
The one who washes the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom seems to be pissed.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
I know Tom's in Boston right now.
That's it.
I can transport you.
Is Tom safe?
Still, there's a solution.
You're unorganized.
I'm trying.
I'm sure Tom's gonna make it this way.
I don't think I've ever been so scared.
Can you do the assignment?
We've got to get back to him.
You're uncultured.
Are you playing something?
It just sounds boring.
Bring it in.
Tom has been lying to us all the time.
Tom didn't say he'd help us.
Tom took the knife.
The people in Madrid are insane.
That's totally inaccurate.
I'd better call her first.
He's very sociable.
Tom can't wait anymore.
I just exercise to look nice when I'm naked.
A thousand years is a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
Honest word.
We have three guards working alternately.
We can't stay together, it wasn't written.
Visitors are welcome to visit.
Could you introduce yourself in a few words?
Tom was there.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.
Is Tom contributing?
This is a bit of a shame.
We were both very busy.
I'm three hours away.
I want crusades.
I was expecting them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom shut his mouth.
So don't you hate him?
Stop behaving like a child.
Tom's not pale.
He never hired them.
I like cakes.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom is a retired dentist.
That was very nice.
I'm going to hide.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
Soon he will leave his parents’ home.
Tom resisted.
The scars are barely visible.
Tom's a dwarf.
I'll take you home.
My husband's a doctor.
It's a spider's chestnut.

I'm used to talking in public.
She was crying for luck.
Tom came out of prison.
I'm glad I work here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for the green light.
Do you want me to shave your shoulders?
It's on my head.
I sneezed with my head.
Tom told me he was planning to go to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going to finish.
I'm going to change.
Put down my headphones.
It might sound like a proposal, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom that I want him to give me my money back today.
You'd be a great mother.
Tom continued to work.
Please find my head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom doesn't agree.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, my film will be broken.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but just never, could that happen here.
Tom was warming up in front of the fire.
That's what I don't want to talk about.
It would be normal for you to be mad at Tom.
Tom swims every day.
This is the best steak I've ever tasted.
Why don't you call him?
I want to use these.

You should try to write with respect.
I'll sit there.
She's older than him.
I baked them a cake.
Tom's very patient.
Let's get started.
Come alone.

Tom asked for his lawyer.
Write it to Tom.
I had to help her.
Don't risk it.
Isn't that good news?
Let's assume she was here.
Tom's always mad at me.
Tom's just watching.
Here's your schedule today.
Tom didn't wait.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom is an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thank you in advance.
The question is what you're going to do.
Tom told Mary he was kissing her.
Well, it's not too fast.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
It came back two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you're late for me, I'm late for you.
You really should've let me call a taxi.
I made an apple pie.
The horse's skull calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book covers the whole subject.
I think this is over.
Linda was wearing modest dresses all the time.
Didn't you smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thanked anyone at all.
He challenged his classmates.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom got in touch with Mary.
Are you cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna have to ask Tom for permission.
Not everyone laughed at his jokes.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They ate.
How many cups of coffee a day is too much?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I flipped with my hands.
Tom has no brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You would have taken my place, too.
Now, let's continue the conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I was smiling.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
You gonna go?
I'm happy every day.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop betting.
Try to figure this out.
What kind of man were you?
I should try to help them.
Can I pick up my soul?
She's helping him.
You always try to see the best in people.
Tom earns three times as much as I do.
I rinsed one.
Write down your date of birth.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'll call him later.
These are just as good as they are.
She looked excited.
We're spending time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to come to the party.
Just try to find him.
Tom hung his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's a little kid.
Is the difference visible?
Visit us tomorrow. . . .
Tom visited Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do that.
Is this your bag?
It will help her to sleep the most.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
I'll pay for the gardens.
They've been scanning for half an hour.
Dolkun has been working very intensively lately, but doesn’t see the slightest result of that.
Dan found out that Linda was looking for the police.
I'm making dinner.
Please come to me next Saturday, if you want.
I'm not sure.
That's not really necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was going.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's sleeping tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Tom has obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hatred.
You have a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thank you for coming.
I am as tall as he is.
Tom would not have succeeded without Mary’s help.
So there's Tom?
He spent the night drinking in one of the meat bars.
I'm in.
Do you need a ride?
Soul is gone.
I didn't say I believed him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to owe you.
They're coming back.
You're really cute.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
That's a fucking joke.
I wouldn't trust Mary at all.
I've never seen the wine.
I don't think they followed us.
I feel like I'm free.
Just keep smiling.
I didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom also helped Mary escape from prison.
Tom has no tea.
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.
But that's not an argument!
Tom got a pussy.
What can I tell the kids now?
Leave him, Tom.
I overcame the shock.
It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom that tall.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew that Mary was upset.
Tom started to shoot.
How'd you go on vacation?
There were only a few of us in a group of gorillas.
She started rubbing her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
What if I don't invite Tom to my party?
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
Do you travel a lot?
Did you tell Tom about the back pain you have?
Everybody does.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom collects postage stamps.
I want you to find her.
The water is bright in the sun.
A is a plurality that consists of members B, B and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's well known that you don't care, Tom.
I'd be happy if you three came back out.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
Kids give bubbles.
Exercise volume of violin at least half an hour each day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's a lot of fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered along with them.
Ask Tom to have more time for me.
I'm looking for him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a shock.
You're burning the car.
She was able to learn how to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have the willpower when it comes to exercise.
Let's go to Tom.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room is noisy.
At your service.
I want to watch football on TV.
I'd like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need a lot of food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable to him.
I invited Tom to my house.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more things I have, the more I have to clean.
I found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don’t forget to use sunscreen.
Was it hard for you?
Tom’s voice was barely heard.
Don't get too tired.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We're gonna have to take over.
His depression ended when he kissed him.
We're not even sure if Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just squeeze.
Tom's good with me.
No one's gonna find us.
The room was chaos.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom's gonna wait.
I'm hungry for you.
The real story is a little different from what I told you.
It was your fault.
The balloon was slowly descending.
Who wants insects?
It's shit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps, then jump.
I think we need to wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never pretended to be ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You're not overthinking, are you?
When the phone ringed in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm completely naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn’t matter that you don’t want to do that; you have to anyway.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Marisol and Johnny are eating pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something to get our thoughts out of trouble.
I called him yesterday.
Let me focus. Let me focus.
She's selling sea schools.
Wardy the prisoner.
We all like you.
The boy was crying and crying for hours.
I'll go ask them.
Tom is not like his brother at all.
Tom was different.
That was brilliant. That was brilliant.
Please, tell me.
You're not weird.
Aren't you excited?
Tom would never have been able to do it on his own.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce you to Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
Maybe you'll need it.
I have chest pain.
I can't unplug the knots.
Give me the money back.
You have to show up first.
My father is a silent man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional carpenter.
He stole my new watch.
It doesn't look very different.
He's re-educated.
Tom made Mary's room on the couch.
We're breaking it.
It's good.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I'm happy or not.
Did you hit her?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his journey.
Your statement is right up and down.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary got out of the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the precious stones last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I've already packed up.
Since when do you feel the movements of the fetus?
I can't do that alone.
You better let me do that.
This house is better than the other one.
Tom must have done it.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm at the end.
Marry me.
Tom is not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun and the night shine.
No one's gonna get fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on the bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom caught the fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
The person who pays the bills has the right to be master.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, bring me some cashew.
When will you visit us?
Every day there are tragedies.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening.
Give me those sheets.
You can take mine.
Tom wouldn't like that.
All comments are superfluous.
Did you do this for me?
Can you call them for help?
Tom rinsed his mouth.
It smells like cheese.

We know him.
I've been there for about an hour.
Tom was holding a drink in his hand.
What a couple they are!
Did Tom get up early this morning?
Your complaints disturbed me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
You think Tom likes his job?
It's noisy here.
What can be done?
I guess you found him.
Don't take it overly.
Tom's pretty clever.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.
I'm going to get a point.
You mean you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have failed without Mary's help.
Tom cooperates.
The snow is one foot deep.

I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This will do the job for now.
They need to talk.
That's not exactly what happened.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom listened right away.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.

I'm attracting you so much.
What's up for dinner?
Open it on page nine.

Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't sneeze or I'll wash your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a present.
I'm not quite happy with Tom's explanation.
Looks like you're right.
He ran away so they wouldn't catch him.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom's not back yet.
It has sentimental value.
I asked her to play with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
We need to set up a trap.
Tom's parked, he'll be right there.
Love me a little, love me a long time.

Tom's not generous.
You can't prove anything.
Tom hates green peppers.
Don't you panic?
We need to do this again someday.
I think Tom's sensitive.
He's an honest man.
Your pajamas are too big.
We'll turn it back.
Is there anyone else?
Not all people are the same. However, that's good news, because it means that not all people are bad.
Isn't that exciting?
Tom came to ask for help.
It's easy for me to talk to them.
Tell me where to find it.

That's really great.

Doesn't sound like who knows what.
Tom tried to escape.
I have a swelling of cats.
The crowd clapped.
I'm letting velvets grow on the edges.
I think Tom's a bad guy.
The door was locked.
I'll catch your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
What do you see now?
We've been subjugated.
I was too tired to continue.
It has its own sound.
What the doctor thinks is wrong.
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
It's on his forehead.

Don't be so proud of that.
Get up when you call me.
He's always happy.
The forest was very quiet.
I have to get back to them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom's inclined.
Most of the clothes that the Europeans wear are made outside of Europe.
Tom's still busy.
Why do I have to crawl?
We can search on the internet.
When I was younger, I always travelled by car.
I couldn’t figure out exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom's gonna object.
It's so obvious we don't need any evidence.
I bought a pair of shoes.
How negative you are.
We haven't found Tom yet.

You beat her.
The stars have emerged.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your personal army.
I often play volleyball.
Where's the blouse I bought you?
It will teach them in order.

Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy a house like this.

We're ready to fight.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.

Wash yourself.
Tom refused to leave.
Do you have some time?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I eat something?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's an emergency.
I won't bother you.
Stay here and keep her safe.
Wouldn't you start bathing your hair from that?
How are you gonna run away?
Let’s start with this wine.
My leg's broken.
How are you gonna do that?
I took Tom for lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd be interested to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like the English language?
That’s what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these cuffs from my grandmother.
I have no problem drinking.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong thing.
She's in great condition.
I grabbed Tom for the elbow.
Mary loves fashion and makeup.

Toasted spinach.
Do you know what happened?
Stop talking about me.

Just do what you want.
Can I use it for that?

What's all this about?
You'll have to study badly next year.

I just want money.
I'm not saying shit about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom don't agree.

Your mother put your collar in the top drawer.
You've been through traffic, but you'll be fine.

I don't know why you don't like it.
No, I didn't mean that!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I don't think I bought this.
He saved a sailor.
Apparently Tom was here earlier in the morning.
Get up again, you bastard!
How long ago was it?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.

I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They look busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.

Is there a problem?
Knock at the door.

I don't comment on their articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
This is just a bullet.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make a reservation.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Take care of Tom.
It's just words.
There was a short silence.

I don't want to cook.
Tom was unbearable.
I agree with the plans.
Truth is expressed through action.
I don't know if you know it or not, but here in America you're expected to leave a kiss to the waiter.

That would be okay.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Go as long as you can.

I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
Falling from the tree.
Tom told Maria that he had never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go and help him.
Tell me if you get a boyfriend.
It was wonderful.
Why do they all hate him?
I barely see him.
I'm coming.
I was in the middle.
Don’t expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good things and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna get confused.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
Something beat me up.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I looked at the man.
Take care of him, Tom.
They seem familiar to me.
We've got work to do for them.
All my dreams will come true.

I want you to be with me.
I want to play golf.
Tom is deeply interested in the history of art.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.

Did you at least fall asleep?
Probably it's still available.
Looks like we're going to have a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, didn't you?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town and he needs work.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in an enclosed room.
It was a great concert.
There's no answer.

This is really easy.
Will you walk?
You should try it.
You're loaded with worry.
I don't think Tom's gonna help us much.
Tom seems worried.
I take care of him.
Tom's amazing.
I suspect that Tom broke the window.
Tom's approaching.
Tom seems shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom's sympathetic.
Let it be brief, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was any way to help.
We could've gotten together.
This isn't anyone's fault.
I don't like the taste of potatoes.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're late.
Tom ran to the barn.
Let's go for lunch.
It's warm since yesterday.
It has to come from somewhere.
The cottage was fully equipped, with a pool, barbecue, football pitch and a pool table.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
We're all pions.
I'll see you again.
We were so young then.
I hear you were wondering about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was bored with his sister.
We should've quit earlier.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
And I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been futile.
"Why are you doing that?" "I can."
What a pig you are.
Lock the gate.
Tom made the heating.
We're all the same.
I want to be with you.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds quite acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was sincere and trustworthy and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not going down.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I won't forget.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it at a butcher's shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would you believe them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two varieties in Irish.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who are you living with?
So, what should I tell him?
Where's your child?
Tom's on the bed and on the phone.
They're wonderful.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was thrilled.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a traitor.
Where did Tom work?
I need the gold to pass them.
The rumors confused the whole city.
A person who loves flowers can’t be a bad person.
This isn't bullshit.
They're flashing.
You're evil.
Did you pass the note to Tom?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a shuttle to the airport.
Are you writing messages to Mary?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Tom was failing.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears assault clothes.
Tom was the boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
Women don't like you.
It's time to get up.
It's not your problem, it's mine.
Before I went to bed, I took three cold pills.
Tom may be wrong.
They might need some help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom's acting like a stained-up deer.
It's a shame you've ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I realized what time we had to leave.
They're very good.
You want movies?
Time is forever.
First, you have no right to draw conclusions. Second, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be boring.
I'm growing goods.
She borrowed the lineage.
I'll see you later.
I had to get something.
I believed them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom's got a headache.
There was a war going on.
And did Tom participate?
The thief turned himself into a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're evil and repulsive.
I wish I could help you more than that.
Tom is no longer seen.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the facade of the building, and when I walked past it by car, I didn't recognize it.
Is it possible that this is all there is?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children were sitting on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Invite him to join us.
It will not be easy to do that without much help.
Tom knows Boston very well.
This time we won.

Boston is a wonderful place.
Who's responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better not to drink this water.

I'm married to Laurie.
Let's have breakfast.
I'll give you my omelet.
Tom explained the rules to Mary in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
They got you, didn't they?
I totally forgot about him.
An interesting question remains unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I pulled my knife out.
They were dancing.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm going to bed at 10:30.
I don't know where it went.
There's a boy running to me.
Tom looks very tired now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I fold it up.
Tom was calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic constituent units of living organisms.
They're entertaining her.
I need to go get dressed.
How long have you been working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunbaba passed away one day after my older sister was born.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom quickly got lost in the crowd.
As far as you know, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a drunk.
This is hard for me.
How do you feel about her now?
I'm not surprised.
That surprised me.
This is what we discussed a few days ago.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn to the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you get confused when we kiss?
Somebody's gonna see us.
I'll give him one more chance.
Tom was finally smiling.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like to do that?
I misjudged her.
It'll be over soon.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my dad?
Tom was preparing to shoot me.
Tom talks.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He knows how to play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a fillet of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger ship than his brother.
God created the seed.
It's not too early.
Can I eat?
They painted them inside the yellow windows.
Tom, are you in here?
You can use this car for yourself.
I'm glad to hear that.
It's as if I'm flattering.
We have to wait here.
Is everything okay with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
No one's talking about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I are going to fly in the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you out.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour before the event.
You were unbelievable.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird raised the branch with the clown and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom was not the same man three years ago.
They all smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to take some time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom struggled to get rid of himself.
What am I gonna be to them?
Tom didn't tell Mary anything.
It's not the right time.
I'll be home by noon.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would take.
Tom runs by Mary's side.
A cat scratched me.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is, how did Tom do that?
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best award.
I can't ask them now.
Tom's got wave hair.
Long live the USSR!
Epten is strong.
I want to buy pineapple.
I was home yesterday.
That's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's a simple question.
The bush is burning.
Tom was affected.
I bite my conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna expose me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom was drunk with tequila.
My grandmother's deaf, in other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're getting a lot of crawling.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's doing something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his face.
Don't you believe us?
I'm respecting you.
Be merciful. Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was it a good trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to develop the habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom picked up his heart.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed outside.
This is the king's most trusted counselor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change your clothes.
Tom was really mad.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
- Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else will I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you could have imagined.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He's changing things.
It's too late to help you.
We were trying to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom continued to climb.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
He lied to me in the eyes.
I'll go find her.
I wanted to get involved.
They're listening.
I didn't know Tom had done it.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
We'd just get to Tom.
Maybe I should help her out.
Do not touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I taught him naively.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on the steak.
He's a little deaf, so talk louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
They're yours for now.
That's a very subtle explanation.
The bedspreads before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It is too risky to fight them in the place of their choice.
Wasn't it awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his ruthless attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
He was convicted of murder.
There's no answer from him.
We’re all looking forward to seeing the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing the shirt one-packed.
When was the last time you cleaned the room?
Let's not argue, okay?
The dinner was really good!
Control yourself. Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative and division is not.
I'm in trouble.
Tom took off his hat and hugged him.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
Whose manuscript is this?
Have you seen what it says in today's newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom whispered loudly.
It was Better.
Tom started to talk.
I'll ask you to stay for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all pointed to her.
Maybe Tom's gonna die in the morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll get there on time.
Tom was insane.
Limenkava is empty.
There's grapes in the refrigerator.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom relaxed his hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The couple wet my glasses.
So it wasn't.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We were all screwed up for her.
Didn't you see the flag?
Relax!
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I think I found one like that.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom's been without food for a week.
I really don't understand you.
Although I am a pious man, I am still a man.
Tom, I'm sorry I'm late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so angry.
A lot of people hunt.
It deserves the prize.
Can we have a word?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We've got to investigate something.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't go out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are your breasts?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said something?
Tom began to say something, but Mary shut up.
We met in Meana.
How was Tom doing?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I've been looking for a whole town looking for a house.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York City.
Please come in.
The drug should be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
It seems our job is not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
My guilt has fallen.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you a hundred loaves of bread.
Pigs of marzipan don't crawl.
Tom is aware.
Tom was angry with Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom is right about it.
Tom might be here today.
There is no difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom is a hero.
Tom has no power of will.
Will you help me out?
Don't get distracted by me.
Tom wasn't home when I turned around.
I still don't understand.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on, let's go.
It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I've been home all night.
We looked out from there at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
He used to love Boston.
We don't have that much money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk, you're only 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human because it is of another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don’t think there’s a cure for it yet.
Every member must be present.
She didn't understand her joke.
This is the worst snow I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me pass the message to Tom.
Where's my golf gear bag?
Read these Instructions.
We're not criminals.
Wheat is made from wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on the subject.
You're right.
I'll go.
Today is my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar to me.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy the presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're so beautiful.
Tom and Mary were having fun together.
It's possible I'm wrong.
What's luck?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
He cut his key bone while he was playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
That's where I was with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pencil.
Tom is blind.
Do you really think this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was pissed.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecies were fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I was cooking something.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom screaming.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't be nervous about it.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's time to shut down.
Leave it to me.
The stone slipped down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's just crazy.
Let's go again!
Don't make his heart.
There is no need to comment.
Chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
At that time, Tom was swimming.
The penguins are very sweet.
You're such a scoundrel.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was okay here.
Looks like they're jagged.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never get out of my house for slippers.
I think Tom's a spider.
Diseases of a terrible infection and the ovaries and originated.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't work.
He's not coming in.
Tom pointed to the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He sometimes behaves strangely.
We're gonna hang them.
This is probably not the right time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was very stupid.
How's it going, Tom?
I have other things I should do.
Believing in Justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of crackers.
You're influential.
I got a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake cakes?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is very relaxing.
Call him right away.
Hold on to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I have a ton of questions.
This is an interesting, funny, and even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language sees the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Wear your pyjamas.
That's it.
This is a holy land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come get a drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We've got it all.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he didn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you find it, live it all?
This was at the top of the cup.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we broke up.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found another one.
I don't know if I'm going to sit or run.
Don't you think it's too hot for a decoy?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Do you get stuck in it?
We just found them.
I bite my tongue.
I'll call him.
I lost my sense of time.
This island is a U.S. territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked her a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are gathered in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I'd do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You shaved your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little confused.
Tom decided to become a vegan.
I don't have time today.
No one wants to buy these things.
It's not here or there.
The phone records are fascinating.
You don't have to be defensive.
This is the most beautiful pizza in the whole city.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things don't change.
