The victim’s brother, Luis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO television channel in San Francisco that Frank, a former Boston-based broadcaster, got his dream job as a chef at San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and oppressed" by his death.
“We are a small team that works as a friendly family and will miss it very much,” the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first stayed in hostels, but lately, "He's finally got things right."
“He found the apartment, he was dating a girl,” Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn’t imagine someone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good heart and a good heart.
His way of connecting with the family has always been to prepare us some dishes, to prepare us dinner,” said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of conflict.
He was a brother who floated along the river.

Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years.
An international team of biologists concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years.
The researchers conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the eye crystal of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five meters long, can be from 272 to 512 years old.
Biologists believe that a shark’s low metabolism plays an important role in its longevity, which leads to slow development.
Females of Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity only by the age of 150.
It was previously believed that the longest of all vertebrate animals live "neighbor" of sharks - the Greenland whale.
The oldest person known to scientists was a little over 210 years old.

Is it worth going to the sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief physician of the sanatorium Olga Boghush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
Sanatorium and resort rest is needed not only for treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In a sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his body and get a doctor's advice on how to live, so that his health is not ruined.
Such recommendations will not be unnecessary to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, it is not worth smiling from.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And about 90% of the people who come are stressed.
And it is most exposed to people from large cities aged 45 to 55.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and give yourself time to rest.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay at the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the whole family.
So, if you want to spend holidays with children, you don’t have to break up with them.
For children, even the youngest, health programs are provided, which include both diagnostic services, pediatric consultations, tests, and therapeutic.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalations, a special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, therapeutic fitness.
The course of procedures determines the doctor taking into account the individual indications and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, usually works a children's club with animators, where children can attend play classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with babies, provide the necessary conditions for the nurses and provide services to the experienced nurse.
A soft winter, a long summer, an abundance of sunny days a year (over 300) create good conditions for a year-round rest in the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather behind the window, especially since most procedures are carried out indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium and resort treatment is desirable to be carried out 2 times a year, especially for adults.
The main fish of the Caucasian Mineral Waters region, of course, the therapeutic mineral sources: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects the various systems of the body.
Water differs in temperature, amount of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor chooses water depending on the patient’s well-being.
Thus, "Narzan" has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating action, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Essentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the level of sugar.
"Essentuki new" has anti-inflammatory, bile and urinary effect.
The same effect has the water "Slavianovskaya".
When prescribing water, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it chooses less salty water, because the salts hold the liquid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
Intake of mineral water requires compliance with the regimen: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Now there are different cosmetological procedures available in the sanatoriums for the face and body.
What types of healing, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained in the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tambukan, a dirt from which is useful for joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, absorbing, immunomodulating effect.
These are wellness walks along individually constructed routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in close proximity to the mineral source "Narzan".
There you can also take baths of wine, pearls, iodorous, selenium, shelf-lacrity, depending on what your doctor will prescribe.
Prolonged fruiting.
What can you do to ensure that the harvest reaches the end of the season?
Tells Yulia Belopuhova, a farmer and dachshund.
It is time for the tall tomatoes to arrange a haircut: to remove new pashins, cut the masks, remove all the leaves until the last brush with fruits and inflorescences with small ties - will not be able to mature.

Of the chemicals at the end of summer, it is worth using only copper copper, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
Let's do the last watering of the plants.
Long-sleeved cucumbers in the greenhouse are deposited from the wallpaper so that the lower, naked part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, water with warm water and a solution of Zirconia, soak the stem 5-7 cm of compost.
Prolonging the fertility of the cabbage is also easy: cut old leaves, pour hot water and a solution of complex fertilizer, pour fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against night colds, place the bow over the bed with a cover material.
Keep the plant open during the day, and close after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is coming out of the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s exit from the longest recession in the last twenty years.
According to Bloomberg analysts, Russia’s GDP is showing a positive dynamic – in the second quarter, GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to Rosstat, the decline in the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The stabilization of the situation was also recently announced by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development.
Slow growth ahead.
According to the experts of the CBR, the recession in the Russian economy remains in the past.
“The index estimate of Russian GDP indicates that the recession has remained behind, and the slow growth of the economy ahead,” says the Bank of Russia’s bulletin, “what trends say.”
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter has been increased to 0.4%, while the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
As reported by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter the decline of the Russian GDP stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared GDP decline was 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter the decline stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was in the range of 0-0.15", - quotes the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of RIA "Novosti".
The slowdown in the decline of the Russian economy over the last five quarters indicates that “the bottom is gone.”
Among other markers pointing to signs of a revival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls the growth in demand for electricity and rail transport, a revival of business.
If you make an amendment to the fact that the year is high, then it is clear that the dynamics of plus 1% of electricity consumption may be half due to an additional working day.
Add to this a lower annual average temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight transport, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and plus-minus 0.5% of the half-year volume can also be explained by seasonality," - explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR Broker.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, a reduction in price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, in the last two weeks, Rosstat has recorded deflation.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble, which, although showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, by the end of August has strengthened by 12% since the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," - Yakovenko emphasizes.
In addition, since April in the Russian Federation, the volume of industrial production is increasing.
In June, the figure increased by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade is slowing from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
The positive trend is also reflected in the labour market, where the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%.
It was just below in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the prosperous situation in the labour market, the question of real disposable incomes of the population leaves to wish for the better.
In annual terms, the figure decreased by 4.8%.
This factor may hinder the recovery of the economy, as household expenditures make a significant contribution to GDP.
As a rule, in the structure of the economy, their share is more than 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, as risk factors for economic growth can also be called the strict policy of the Bank of Russia.
The regulator keeps the bet at the level of 10.5%, which does not best affect the real sector.
A negative factor is the insufficient level of investment, which hinders the development of industrial capacity.
But overall, it can be assumed that by the end of the year, the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow to -0.5% versus -3.7% in 2015," - says Forex Club GK analyst Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well lived in the winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, until not so actively developed in the summer sports.
If the Olympic Games in Rio are for Russia and former foreigners are present, then in most cases it is about the native countries of the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro we can observe the reverse process - a fairly large number of Russians stand under the flags of other countries.
In each case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Some parents took him to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone has not resisted the competition for a place in the Russian team.
And some believed that the best conditions for development in the sport will be created abroad.
“AiF.ru” found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of the 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Red.
But before that, she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to do light athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose to jump with six.
Stay in Russia, it’s unlikely that she could “lift from the throne” Elena Isinbayeva.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio Lisa will be our only, albeit ex-girlfriend, in the jumping sector with the sixth.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the 2016 Continental Championship, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
Elena Pirzykova, 29, was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the evangelical direction.
Many because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight other children grew up in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to be passionate about fighting in school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where at the U.S. Fight Training Center she continued classes under the direction of another former Russian Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Championships that same year, it was a victory.
By the way, she was able to win silver at the 2010 World Championships.
Then there were the bronze of 2013 and the silver of 2014.
The 26-year-old Mary was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first met synchronous swimming.
But it would be wrong to say that our coaches in Russia have educated her.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
Mary continued her studies there.
Soon she was already in the U.S. team and showed great results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level for Russian synchronists it cannot make up competition, but for America its indicators are the ceiling.
The new name, which in Russian sounds odd, was given to Kristina Shalybina at the age of 11 when her parents decided to continue teaching the girl art gymnastics overseas.
Until that time, the girl was engaged in a favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly joined the country's youth team, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Christian won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she didn’t have to fight, but for the United States she organized a real breakthrough – bringing the star-studded team to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former "artist" is Jana Beresko-Marggrander, who plays for the German national team.
She was born in Toliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where she had more prospects of joining the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympics in London.
There, indeed, she was able to occupy only 17th place, insufficient to get into the finals in the personal championship.
But two years before that, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - youth.
Another gymnast, only this time sports - Irina Sazonova.
If the routes of emigration of the aforementioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
Iran is a student of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland she immediately became the country's champion.
True, Iran is still training in Russia - especially coming to his homeland to not lose his skill.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in personal multiplayer.
There is very little information about the floating Maria Ukolkova in the Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria lives and trains in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it has appeared under the Russian flag, showing good results - it was even the country's record at a distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she obtained Swiss citizenship and began performing under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in a 4<0xC3><0x97>100 complex stage.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6,000 francs, which allowed her to pay for preparations for the Olympics.
The 31-year-old freestyle fighter Adam Batyrov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Hasawurt managed to become the three-time winner of the European Championships, the champion of Russia, the master of sports of Russia of the international class.
When he stopped joining our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For several years, the talented fighter disappeared from the sports bridges.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championship - Batyrov was already represented by Bahrain, for whom he won the gold medal and received a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, is even less known at home than even the Swiss swimmer Maria Ukolkov.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was quite young.
It was there that Mikhail began to practice sports gymnastics.
He has not achieved much success at the international level.
In Rio, his best score was 40th place in qualifying on parallel squads.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympics in sports gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Nasta, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronous swimming classes, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronous swimming.
In a duet with Eugene Tetelbaum Anastasia took eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Crowter is in favor of the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry became the country's champion.
That same year he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Crowder also wins the gold of the Youth Olympics in Singapore.
In addition to jumping in height, Dmitry is engaged in long jumps and triple jumps.
The 31-year-old Albert is another native of Hasawurt, who, after long speeches for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia he played for the Krasnoyarsk School of Higher Sports Skills, in 2011 he even became the country's champion.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the USSR volleyball team player Yaroslav Antonov.
Literally a year before the birth of the son Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family stayed there for a permanent residence.
In 2015, as a member of the national team, he became the bronze winner of the European Championship, held in the territory of his new homeland.
Hajiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and fell with his family at the height of the war.
Ten years later, my parents decided to emigrate.
The initial goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country - it had to travel to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to train in the free struggle.
He soon won the World Junior Championships and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the fight tournament.
And again the free fight, and again the former Russian.

Before that, the 30-year-old athlete managed to score high results in Russia as well.
He became the bronze winner of the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
The statute of failures in the team, Timuraz decided to change sports citizenship.
The last on our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala, - Arthur Biarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur, on the advice of his elder brother, began to practice boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he has been the world champion of youth.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why do Cossack kids have classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, "the saying is to be raised not by actions and parades, but systematically".
They must grow and at least 7 years old understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossacks.
But so far this work seems to me to be done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossacks classes take into account all the positive things that have been accumulated before, at a qualitatively new level, I will be happy.
If all is inflamed and it is not known how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
The JRC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country’s economy.
The striker has a place for the funds allocated to the needs of the utility sector from budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor-General's Office, exaggerated tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the field of LGBTQ.
As a result, the consumers of the region have overpaid the energy more than 170 million rubles.
On the days and the prosecutor’s office of Krasnodar region revealed the facts of inclusion in the tariffs of unjustified costs.
And in the expenses of LLC "IV-consulting" (by putting cold water) were invested 4 million rubles. for the rental of cars at the price above the market.
And such examples in the country of the masses.
The people donate the last money for the "communal", and they pay correctly - according to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is accused of several articles of the Penal Code at once: loss, legalization of criminal income, abuse of powers, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, who was engaged in the repair of urban buildings, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, the work on them was practically not carried out, but paid for.
The businessmen just gave him much of the money back.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but he did not pay the service providers and spent it on his own needs.
As a result, damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
Makarov's scheme of machinations, well, is typical for Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions of UK leaders, who allocated citizens’ money.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan continues, by the way, also a former member of the forest council, who is accused of fraud of 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013 in Elizovo Kamchatskiy region he established 6 managing companies and established 3 limited liability companies.
One of them did contract work for the UK, the other two played the role of accounting and cash centers, i.e. took money from the population.
However, A. Kohan did not list the funds, but spent on himself, loved one.
Judging in the field of HR is quite difficult.
Cases are not triggered, they are delayed.
And "help" in this extremely confused housing legislation, - thinks Svetlana Razvorotneva, Executive Director of NP "ZKH Control".
We fail to make one law as we invent a new one that must make the previous one work.
There are also very few experts, including among judges, on the issues of HR.
The lawyers themselves admit that the housing law in the universities is given very little attention.
Refusals to initiate criminal proceedings are also discussed in the Prosecutor-General's Office.
Less than half of the 3.5 thousand crimes in 2015 were prosecuted.
The remainder of the investigation was protracted, and one in five was suspended in connection with the indisposition of the accused.
Often, deficiencies in the activities of law enforcement agencies are attributed to gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the investigative authorities are not in a hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
Over the five months of this year, their number has only increased slightly - 99.
What is the falsification of the Protocol of the Assembly of Residents?
This means: changing the management of the house, financial and other issues are going to circumvent the opinions of the owners.
And this also means that normal companies that want to work honestly and not "do" the population cannot penetrate the housing and utility market.
As a result, residents in the downside, small and medium-sized businesses as well.
First of all, through the eradication of corruption as a whole in the whole state, said Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property Matters.
And now this work is being carried out actively.
It’s not just single shares – it’s a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, in the capital, scandals do not smell.
Why are there no such scandals in Moscow in the sphere of ZKH, as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital’s government has expressed its iron will and established order,” said Anatoliy Vyvorny, a member of the State Duma’s Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean both the staff question, and the legislative amendments, and the legal education.
The management companies are under close supervision, and all of them have passed through licensing.
Citizen complaints are quickly resolved in public space (and the treatment of residents, and the response measures are placed on the portal of the Moscow Government).
Many don’t just pay monthly receipts, but keep a close eye on what’s written in the house.
Awareness among the public about the rights of owners and the obligations of resource-providing and managing organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow checks the validity of tariffs on housing and utility services - because a large part of the budget funds go to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
All of this explains the peace of mind in Moscow.
Is it at the will of the regional authorities?
Is it possible to change the job?
The Turkish Gambit.
Will Erdogan renounce his friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has proposed an ultimatum by proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup.
He said this in a speech to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to give up their support for a “terrorist organization of fetchulists.”
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change of position.
Experts believe that Turkey’s relations with the West are growing and could lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO (The Terrorist Organization of Fetchulakhists).
Either the organising of the FETO coup d’état or a democratic Turkey.
She has to make this choice,” the Anatolian agency quoted Erdogan’s appeal, which took place on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The president of Turkey once again, but has insisted more strongly on the United States to comply with his demand for the first time since the suppression of the uprising.
On the night of 16 July in Turkey, senior representatives of the Turkish army undertook an attempt to overthrow legitimate power in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Erdogan appealed to the population, the rebellion was suppressed, and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In total, about 8,000 people were suspected, among whom, in addition to the military, were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan’s supporters also admitted that the coup d’état could involve Americans directly.
The U.S. denied all claims to its address, refusing to issue Gulen and advising to change the tone.
The latest statement by the State Department on this account was made at the time of Erdogan’s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey – he insists on his own and also raises demands on his other Western partners.
“Ankara will stop fulfilling its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union unless Brussels mentions the date of the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens,” Turkey’s Minister for EU Affairs, Omer Chelik, said on August 9.
According to him, Ankara’s amendments to the anti-terrorism law, as the EU requires, would jeopardize Europe’s own security.
On August 1, Germany’s deputy chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, called on Turkey to stop the EU’s blackmail by promising to open borders for migrants in order to ease the visa regime with the EU.
His words were in response to the relevant statement of Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement Chávushoglu made last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to leave NATO.
The head of the Turkish foreign ministry did not rule out that the country would consider leaving the alliance if it did not meet the support expected from it.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the field of defence is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign countries in the field of defense, importing missiles," Chavushoglu said in an interview with the agency Anadolu.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
"To date, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others," he said.
Experts believe that all this speaks of Turkey’s serious disagreements with the West and the country’s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Eugene Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is now leading his game and cannot go to a harsh confrontation with the West.
He has a lot of ties to the West both from a business point of view and from a military point of view (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance by maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a completely obedient person in this post,” the expert explained.
According to him, it is not excluded that after the Turkish leader’s statements (on the non-payment of EU compensation, on the demand for visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the US) will be pressed on him.
"Redjep Erdogan will face deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will pressure him on humanitarian issues, dictatorial methods of governing the country, and so on," Minchenko said.
The head of the Political Information Center, Alexei Mukhin, admits that the President of Turkey will change his point of view on relations with Russia as soon as it is beneficial to him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely harsh position on Russia and in every way sought favor in the West.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
The guarantee that after some time, the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again is no.
I think Erdogan entered the period of leading diplomacy.
Having been between the two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Muhin said.
According to him, the main task for the president of Turkey today is to maintain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnerships with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States stop supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which through it controls the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached,” the expert said.
Another point of view is the head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glazov.
Turkey’s relations with the EU and the US are tense enough now, and this is primarily related to the internal policy that Erdogan personally pursues.
I think that this crisis in relations will be exacerbated, and in the face of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reboot politics both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, say they are ready to change their position on a number of issues about Syria, the relations with Israel are resolved, active political interaction with Iran is going on,” - explained Aif.ru Glasova.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is currently pursuing is a return to the foreign policy concept followed by Turkey before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
“It was then that Turkey began to actively develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in the positions of ‘zero problems with neighbors’.
We have now had very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and the countries of Africa.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey’s positions both on the regional and international stages,” the expert said.
Mr Glazov believes that returning Turkey to its previous relations with the EU will be incredibly difficult, but now the question is rather whether the EU will begin to respond harshly to Turkey, which can go to the opening of borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Younger Doctors Strike: Calls for New Collective Protests
Representatives of junior doctors appealed to the union to sanction new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The Committee of Junior Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask its full advice to support more collective protests since the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
In July, junior doctors and medical students voted in favor of canceling the deal under a work contract agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had continued to "silence persistently" about the problems that, she said, led to the rejection of the employment contract.
“Given the current situation, the JDC leader voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues,” she said.
In response to the government’s silence, the head of the JDC made an official request to the BMA Council’s extraordinary meeting today to approve a continuous program to expand collective protests starting in early September.
The dispute led to the participation of young doctors in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of BMA’s junior doctors, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after voting for the repeal of the agreed terms of the contract that BMA recommended.
He told members of the BMA that the deal was a good deal to take during the meetings ahead of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be used for healthcare workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: “Alliance of the Bad”?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gold-plated palace in St. Petersburg, I had the lasting impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
It's been handmade, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile looked tense, and he barely emitted heat even on his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his “dear friend” Mr. Putin – five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant the opposite.
But the delayed cold coming from Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in the introductory comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was unprecedented.
Mr. Putin was angry with the tyranny, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The sadness was even stronger, based on the supposed friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russia’s public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media carried out a stunning, total offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it turned out that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were allegations from senior management that Mr. Erdogan’s own family had slipped into the illegal oil trade in areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denies it decisively.
But in St. Petersburg an official signal was received that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could have claimed a victory of some sort.
For Ankara, the benefits of proclaiming a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost dropped from his post last month in an attempted coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him as well.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen sharply to almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here, of course, will feel relief when the flights are finally resumed.
They peak at the end of the season in the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products will be allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," the report said in the newspaper Vedomosti.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West because it considers it a weak response to a coup attempt.
Add to this her delayed dissatisfaction with the turtle pace of talks about joining the EU and Mr Putin’s move – which seeks to take advantage of the cool and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of elected authorities after an attempted coup d’état.
Keep in mind, this is a fact for Moscow, which has its own deeply rooted fear of regime change.
So, the summit in this brilliant palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described me as a “bad alliance”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West, unite forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, these two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
Perhaps, he says for himself, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents gave a press conference, they didn’t even touch on the topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the answer to the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and considering the possibility of a full disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian reactive fighter — it’s definitely better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank’s executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies used "RBS" to protect other consumer credit brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of international sports sponsorship, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But it has now been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external headquarters and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will gain more influence – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt’s Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave an interview during a customer and employee tour to Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one that our staff will be engaged in because we are now becoming more and more a bank of brands.”
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is expanding the profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
“This is a good time for us to move the bank of brands, because basically (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we've done focusing on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of changes.
We can bring these brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches up to 3,000 winners with Newmarket victory at the Prisons
Detectors Spray Champagne After Newmarket Double Leads It to 3,000 Wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori scored his 3,000th British win in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with the help of his second night winner on his home track – the Passion Trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to have achieved this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willy Carson.
Three-time jockey champion Dettori, who had previously won at Ghayyar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I’m very happy that it happened in Newmarket, as this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It’s not a big secular event, it’s not Royal Ascot – it’s a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free of charge and very unpleasant.
Dettori accepts applause when it leads Predisposition after victory
Two jockeys scored such a mark in a jump with obstacles: jockey champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins for a record career.
Lester Piggott, Derby's nine-time winner, 4493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he has achieved this mark that so few have achieved.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical softener that distinguishes him from others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for jumping, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frank a few weeks ago at Epson, he would bring 6,000 winners if he weren't just a joke weekend and big jumps!
And if you're serious, Frankie's been leading the winners in the UK for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He’s an energetic character that’s good for British jumpers, but more importantly, he’s an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with the company's fast-paced horse jumper
From fast-paced finishes to fast-paced jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
They were ups and downs.
Many big jump winners, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified due to doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed a tremendous power of will to challenge the skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while — Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue participating in the competitions at least until the age of 50.
Putin resigns head of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his head of administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted neighbourhood for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as the representative for the environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin says that Putin "decided to free Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the president," but did not specify the reason.
Mr. Ivanova's deputy, Anton Wayno, has been appointed as his successor since 2012.
Mr. Winno, 44, a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Embassy of Tokyo.
He was later the head of the administration of the president’s protocol and the government apparatus, the Kremlin’s website reports.
During his appointment, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as heads of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being followed.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released from this position and recommended that Wayno replace him.
Are smiles convincing?
This was a move that confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, the two men said that the head of the administration had resigned at his own will.
But in spite of the smiles on the camera, this has convinced few here — especially right now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unforeseen consequences of any struggle for power?
So far no one knows.
But the official statement – that a person who was once agitated as a potential president, suddenly wanted to manage Russia’s environmental policy – was met with enormous skepticism.
In Putin’s remarks on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said: “It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in the conversation to trust me this very difficult position, even, you might say, a problematic one for four years.
Well, it turns out, I was the head of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which came to replace the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become the president of Russia after Putin’s second term, as the third term for Putin would be contrary to the constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency after just three and a half years.
"Think as a Criminal" star Thomas Gibson fired after a fight with producer
Gibson was a part of the slippery slope on the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday, before it was announced that he would be removed.
There were creative differences in the footage and differences in opinions.
I’m sorry that it happened,” he said in a statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be removed from the show, which monitors a team of FBI agents, is expected to arrive later, according to statements from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Darma and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love 'Thinking like a criminal' and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but now it will not be possible.
I just want to thank the screenwriters, producers, actors, our wonderful team, and most importantly, the best fans that the show could only dream of.
The show is set to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: Fish landed in Banff Garden
The man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could have been sandbags left by water dead.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a footage of this scene in the Periscope in the hope that someone would be able to shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project should now be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern spring and the Queensferry Crossing viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four loops between the canvas beams, which are now approaching completion near all three pylons of the bridge.
The section of the Fifth Bridge is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 watts of bridges.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project should now be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to the engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel have been used only for the construction of this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the junction between the canopy and the bridge canvas is a virtual operation using extremely accurate assembly tolerances.
In total, about 79% of the total bridge canvas is now in place, for the last section of the canvas concrete coating is poured in Rosaita today, which means that all the canvas is ready to rise on the site on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Director for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure on each bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this stunning project, this mixing is the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the road canvas and connecting it to the expanding road canvas of the Northern Pilon, we were then left to close the remaining gap on the northern – or coastal – side.
This was done by dragging the Northern Approach viaduct 700 millimetres southward.
It was a large-scale and at the same time very elegant operation.
Scalable because the 222-metre-long viaduct weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be raised to a slope angle of about 3%.
Exquisite because the permits on which the team worked were small — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Rescue in the Gulf of Moalfrey: Three men are 'lucky to stay alive'
The three men were “lucky to stay alive” after being thrown out of a fishing boat in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised an alarm at 13:20 British summer time on Friday after the team saw an incident unfolding in the Moelfre Bay.
Three men tried their best to reach a safe place, while their ship continued on its way.
“We saw their ship roar next to them and assumed the worst,” said Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, by the time we got down to the water, a strong wind took it away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and the third man, 60, was found disabled and stuck in the pond without a life jacket.
All of them were taken on board a coastal lifeboat and delivered to the rescue station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are fortunate to be alive and completely harmless.
The engine of the boat had an emergency switch, but it somehow disconnected from the person driving the boat when it crashed.
Somebody took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It’s exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out on the street to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint for many over the past decade.
Pokémon Go distracts people from the couch and engages in some physical activity.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games and more recently smartphones.
It’s great to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the overwhelming passion that Pokémon Go is, an app based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (which subsequently produced a series of cartoons, playing cards and other covers).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all of this has lost its relevance a little before the new game became available in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at the time was detained due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, players with smartphones go to search for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, being found, can be ‘photographed’ (through screenshots on your phone) or ‘catched’.
The generation that played the game, being younger, joined the dominant passion, separating from the sofas for the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps a “ordinary” person takes on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people tracked by it who performed 30-minute exercises daily jumped from 53% to 45%.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on passing levels.
Many health-care campaigns that convince people to “find 30 minutes,” “stand up from the couch” and “be active every day” have not found an answer because most health-care messages are boring and expressed by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes and also a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it drags people out to the streets to do what they love.
Thus, three basics of health are covered: movement, fresh air, and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring boring ones who are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might knock on the door.
Well, what?
A breakthrough occurred.
After all, despite the fact that smartphone apps such as Fitbit could have tracked our physical activity before, they didn’t give us a reason for lessons like this game.
The novelty fades, and the use will weaken over time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, more games will appear that will combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simona Bailes wins gold of absolute championship in women's gymnastics
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about Sumatra.
Simone Bailes is invulnerable to all of this.
It's dynamic on a base jump.
Unforced on the wrist.
It's stunning on the floor.
Amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic Champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of champion of absolute championship on Thursday, placing a gap between her and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under the olympic attention of the olympic.
Her total score of 62.198 was at a sufficient distance from the silver medalist and teammate "Final Five" Eli Riesman and the Russian bronze medalist Alia Mustafina.
Bailes from the United States performs on a gymnastics bra during the women's individual absolute gymnastics championship final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bailes became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the absolute championship title and the fifth overall, consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps at any time.
She was dissipated when her final overall score was shown and her long journey to this point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as extremely rare athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have elevated their sports to new heights:
Bailes has spent the last three years dominating its sport, winning 15 World Championship medals – including 10 gold medals – with such stunning programs in their mix of labor and precision that when Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton was named the 1984 Olympic Champion, she called it "they".
One last test awaited in Brazil, the competition was not so much between Bailes and the rest of the field as between it and the load of overexpected expectations.
Anything less than going back to his family’s house in Spring, Texas, with a pile of gold medals, would be considered an unreasonable expectation.
Simona Bailes from the United States, left, and Eli Riesman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual absolute championship in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics, Rio de Janeiro.
Bailes earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of resigning national team coordinator Martha Carolyn.
While Bailes insisted that she had never looked to the future during her long journey to the top, that’s not exactly the case.
Part of her free exercise program—which includes her signature pass—is set to Latin American music, which would come right on the street just outside the Olympic Arena of Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a child and open-minded mother of coach Amy Burman during a visit to the room where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a single race in the absolute championship since the summer of 2013 – a track of luck that should continue as long as Bailes wants.
Although Mustafa had a small advantage with two spins, it was a mirage.
Gymnastics and free exercises – where Bailes defends the title of World Champion – lie in a siege.
She went forward again with 15,433 on the bench and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Riesman softly embraced her as they waited for the final account—pure formality—and tears appeared around a bright red with white and blue eye cover by Bailes when the idea, which she once recorded in the album for cuts, disappeared.
Riesman's performance was a small spot for what happened four years ago, when she shared third place, but lost to Mustafa's bronze on the tai-brake.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "Grandma" was far ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise, covered by a return, which sometimes seemed to be in question.
As for Bailes, the 19-year-old’s viral tweet from the start of this week now has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in case of serial killer shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl, who were killed during the deadliest attack in the Phoenix's first serial killer case in the last decade, were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports, in public.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and daughter Ellis, Malia, were shot dead on June 12 when their car was parked on the driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator made about eight shots from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, then hid on another vehicle, the report said.
The police claim that the triple murder is not apparently the result of the robbery, as the perpetrator did not take the wallets or <0x24>2,900 available from one of the adult victims.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to check whether it was linked to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others wounded as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas within four months.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of the house,” Howard KPHO told CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan of the late 1990s, a black BMW of the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and his daughter Ellis, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and which is believed to have been the handiwork of the serial killer.
Investigators found shells and pulled the bullet from the seat and fragments of the bullet from the motor compartment.
Mother of 6-Year-Old Child with Microcephaly: "It's Better"
Like most six-year-old children, Edmund Pixivot loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has a microcephaly — the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picsyveto did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I couldn’t do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign it.
Which, in fact, is not true – of course you sign it,” she said.
Her and her husband Vincent told her that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that it be placed in a specialized medical facility.
“My first response was, ‘I didn’t think people were doing that yet,’” Picsiveto explained.
Edmund walks with pedestrians.
Edmund didn’t sit down and sit down until he was three, and he still doesn’t speak.
But he’s going through some stages slowly.
He walks with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund invented for "please sing to me."
"We are teaching him the sign language," said Picsivo CBS News.
But it’s not just a common sign language — she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur as a result of a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as cortisone and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It’s too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivot recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
I've been telling you all the time what's going to happen?
What's going on?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn’t actually ask for a lifelong prognosis because I don’t expect anyone to be able to tell me.
But Pixivot has encouraging advice for mothers of children with congenital defects due to Zika.
It's getting better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding are the source of rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state by Saturday inclusive.
Numerous rivers in south-eastern Louisiana and south-eastern Mississippi have come off the coast and are threatening large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Meteorological Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and the assistance has already gone to the injured inmates.
Mike Stile, a spokesman for the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that requests for transportation for high water, boats and sandbags were being made.
Stil said that only the arrival of Tangjipahoa asked for tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The risk of flooding remains in force until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
The Meteorological Service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could incline to the area.
In southern Alabama, the service in anticipation of flooding continued until Friday, as rain continued to flow in the Mobila area.
The Comet River next to Baton Rouge and the Ammit River next to the Springs Day, both in Louisiana, were forecast to set a record flood level last weekend.
Synopsis scientist Alec Krautmann said the two rivers could have flooded many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said the flooding downstream at Assenchen is a threat as these inflatable rivers will slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tikpho River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of the flood in Amy and Wilkinson districts in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said the other son, who lives nearby, warned him.
“We woke up and the water kept coming,” Hansford said.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest flood she had seen in 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said he and all members of his family had a disability, and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said rescuers rescued the three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says the flood is "quickly spreading" as rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported a 13.75-inch rainfall from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was oversaturated with rainfall from the middle.
Heavy rains and flooding of streets have led to work to rescue residents from homes in the Tangjipahoa suburbs and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities say.
WWL, a CBS branch, reports that Tanjipahoa's advisor told about 200 flooded houses.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now being drowned.
President Robbie Miller said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets found in high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Ammith and the city of Hammond to accommodate those who were evacuated.
“They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to recede,” he said.
In the town of Hammond, near Tangjipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were available for delivery to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
“The last big flood we had was in March,” said city manager Lacey Landrum.
It is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that the heavy rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several homes were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, the head of Shopper Value Foods at Amity, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before," said Tauson, "and it still flies to the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "boiled with bullets" remains alive after shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, registering the second shooting of a six-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandmother and grandfather identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
The grandmother and grandfather say that Brown suffered numerous gunshot wounds, including his scent, leg, arm, and belly, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
“He got a lot, his little body was shot,” said his grandmother, Delores Melendez, of the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is hospitalized in critical condition and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first class at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-old men is reportedly in critical condition; the other two victims were recorded in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been shot.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shooting between several armed men.
The shells from semi-automatic weapons, attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons, decorated the place of action.
It seems to have been a long battle.
There were shelves on the street, on both sides of the alleyway.
Therefore, apparently, there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting,” said Philadelphia police station captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Many homes and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly watching video surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old girl was struck by a gunshot wound on Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabbie and Laurie?
This is what I call the women’s Olympic gymnastics team this year for several reasons.
First, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, three gymnasts play a key role in this compilation: Simona Bailes, Gabbie Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many white girls.
The composition of this ensemble, supplemented by Eli Riesman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, at last, like America.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American women’s presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the female gymnast number one was an African-American.
Last year, Simona and Gabbie were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed him.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible performances of the three-time World Champion Simona Bailes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez performing unexpected yet virtuous gymnastics exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in the women's individual absolute championship.
And teammate Eli Riesman earned the silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn’t look like that in gymnastics across the country.
Simone, Gabbie and Laurie all chose the same path as Eli and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of coaching Martha Caroly.
But in reality, gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnastics are first trained in private gymnastics clubs, supported by parents who pay for the cost of training, equipment, travel, training, training, training, and training.
Most of these gym clubs are located in the rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and this is an expensive and long-term duty for gymnast families.
Amy Burman, coach of Simona Bailes, and Maggie Hani, coach of Laurie Hernández, have both coached their athletes since they accepted gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable and affordable gymnastics training for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simon, Gabbie and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics classes located in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young boys (mainly black and Latin American) and trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality youth gymnastics that deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to exhaustive work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a life-long positive impact on good health, school success and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and that’s great.
Exercising is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Eli, Lori, Gabbie and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in winning the Olympic Team Gold and for motivating so many girls of different origins to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Younger Doctors Announce Further Strikes After Rejecting Jeremy Hunt’s Offer
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to a revised treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the deal, saying the NHS was on "nothing ground" and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are transferred to a new contract that includes changes in work at night and weekends to improve service at out-of-hours.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the BMA Youth Doctors Committee, said last night in a statement: “Youth doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will nurture the current labor crisis and that it cannot be applied at all times.”
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors will be transferred to the new contract, progress is needed, and time is on the way.
The WMA’s attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to take action and sometimes with complete silence on the part of the government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of younger doctors.
If he does not, then the younger doctors are unambiguous that they are ready to organize the next strikes.
The last strike in late April delayed about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses’ receptions, while nurses and consultants were attracted to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing a revised treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants a better weekend payout for 54,000 junior doctors who will fall under the treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged the younger doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: “The squads do little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already working at the border, and they cause anxiety, physical pain and disruption to patients, siblings and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Junior Physicians and, in conjunction with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of caregivers and corporate awareness policy.
Employees hoped that continued positive support in other important topics such as staff allocation, flexibility of training, additional training for those who return after a break in their careers, the cost of education, the education, the mutual recognition of the curriculum, the education, the education, and the education.
The drug for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use the drug for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day, after authorities recommended giving it to more people and for a longer period of time.
The anti-inversion drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrence of seizures for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NICE Surveillance Service of the UK’s National Health Service has advised to give it to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, now the NICE Supervisory Service of the UK’s National Health Service has advised to give it to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs with approximately 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fatty material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaque.
If the plaque breaks in pieces, it can cause a thrombo that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the thrombo moves, it will be able to move through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk, making the thrombosis less likely.
The NICE Instruction Project, published today, recommends giving people 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention methods, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke often occurs.
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
Pre-recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor – especially the risk of bleeding – is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment for this period.
The culture of PC ownership allows for the proliferation of counterfeiting of votes in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year because of corruption, serving as a push for the government’s report.
A culture of political correctness has led to eye closure, which has turned out to be a widespread falsification of vote counts in Muslim communities, according to a devastating government report published today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles has been scrambling with criticism of the police, election observers and the city administration for ignoring evidence of election violations because of “excessive sensitivity to race and religion.”
The former secretary of local communities, now the anti-corruption king, said voter intimidation on religious grounds was so strong that police should be allowed to put borders outside polling stations to protect scared voters.
He proposes that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters only need to provide their name and address.
The report even suggests applying non-washable inks to people’s fingers when they give up their newsletters, in order to exclude someone from voting twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to the informants, Sir Eric said.
It calls for greater access to the press to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand,” he said.
The report was ordered for Downing Street following a vote scandal in Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, a special court examining election issues ruled that the current mayor, Luffur Rahman, was to be removed from office in connection with a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rachman had “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had made his critics silent, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as it was said, "led his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes raised doubts or were the result of a character when a person votes, presenting himself to someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed special concerns about fraud by voting in the mail, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations on cleaning up the voting system, including a requirement to bring your ID to prove who you are.
In his report, he said: "There has been evidence of the pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, to vote at the will of the elderly, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi descent.
“There have been concerns that ... government agencies have closed their eyes on such behavior because of the excessive sensitivity of ‘political correctness’ to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations on cleaning up the system, including removing political activists from working with ballot papers to stop "collecting votes".
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for tighter checks on registration to prevent the use of voter lists for immigration fraud and privileges.
An option is being considered to require the voters to present an identity card before voting.
Use unwashed inks on people’s fingers as soon as they drop their bulletin to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To conduct systematic verifications of people’s nationality to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on requests for automatic mail voting.
Eliminate political campaign participants and activists from work with full post-voting and post-voting envelopes.
To give the police authority to establish borders around the polling stations.
To amend the law in order to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation in accordance with the Presentation of the People's Act of 1983.
Making photography illegal in polling stations.
To require that English only be used in polling stations (except for Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff force voters to go to the box one by one.
Sir Eric violently attacks the city police, stating that it is "contagious" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The court, which is considering the election issues, disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal acts,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of a reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of evidence — for a number of reasons.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful "checks for the halo" of the electoral registration departments of the city administrations.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court order in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and concealed spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Crazy Bicycle Analog by Kate and Other Celebrities at the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy about French cyclist Polly Ferran-Prevo, who turned out to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is by far not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who can boast of her own famous twin – at least, according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who have more than a surface similarity to the Hollywood Stars.
The Hunter and the Wolf: A member of the U.S. men's bow team, Brady Allison, on the left, compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s double on the bike path, many people online rushed to point out how a particular archer could be a twin of the superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. Arrow Team, Brady Allison, became the cause of the hurricane on Twitter after images of him appearing as scary as the Wolf star from Wall Street appeared.
And in fact, the archer learned about the madness of social media and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
“I personally don’t see a huge resemblance, maybe except for the vegetation on my face,” said Brady Huffington Post.
“He’s an attractive guy, so I think it’s a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will undoubtedly indicate even more this year: the amazing resemblance between British jumper Greg Russelford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafa, with her big expressive eyes, is said to be a precise copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the basin of the South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg has been compared to the star of the Chora Matthew Morrison for many years.

Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimov boasts not only the same burning skin and light hair as actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, according to fans, is similar to the "sports version of Leggefaon".

Olympic commentator on CBC apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Analysis of Byron McDonald's fourth place at the end of 14-year-old Ai Yanghan on a women's freestyle 4x200 m staff upsets CBC viewers on Wednesday in the live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started like a smell" and "died like a pig" during the dive.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began expressing his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200 m freestyle staff.
You could hear McDonald, who was drawn to CBC’s team of commentators to “distract her by color,” say, “This 14-year-old Chinese threw the ball, baby.”
Too excited, started like a smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ay Yang passed the second stage of the squad 1:57.79 – 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing Canadians to eliminate the retreat from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly on the net after being shocked by the tone and expressions used
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: "Did CBC's spokesman just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'????
This idiot didn’t realize they were still on the air.”
About Ai Yanghan from China in the final of the women's 4x200 m freestyle staff said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese threw the ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately clashed with Byron McDonald, calling for him to be fired
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Nothing to yourself <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a racist bitch. <0x23>disgusted
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for McDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance being aired."
It was an unsuccessful choice of words, we’re sorry that it happened.”
The SVS concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement.
A friend of commentator Scott Russell had to apologize to McDonald's face
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comments.
The company also hurried to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to go on air.
Last night, we took action promptly to apologize to our audiences on live broadcasts and our social media followers.
Let's be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's speech, not about her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comments, saying he did not think his words were interpreted as an attack on a person.
"I would like to take the moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's squad," he said on CBC's Olympics broadcast.
“I was talking about a swimmer’s performance, not about her in person.”
'Of course, there was no disrespect, and I'm very sorry.'
The buyer of Primark insulted a woman who shyly tried underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers didn’t know where to take a look when some woman was naked to try panties, on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, she showed how she looked in them, stacked them and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually died four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkstone.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place Mall in Folkstone, where a woman wore knitted pants before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that after a sample of the underwear, the mysterious woman "re-dressed and went out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the shopping hall, she took a pair of pants out of the window, took off her own pants and pants and dressed them up.
“She didn’t try to find a decent place to do it – she just stood there, embarrassed.”
“Everyone stood up when she took her pants off again, and she obviously didn’t like them because she put them back on the shelf.”
She did the same thing with the other three couples before she finally decided that there was nothing she would like, dressed up again and went out.
“It doesn’t seem that she cares who watched her or that she thinks of the person who eventually buys the pants she’s exemplary.”
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said, "How embarrassing it is to think that someone is going to take home the pants that someone else has already worn and they have not been washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, “I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items from the sale after she left – well, the better.”
“I don’t want to come home with a new pair of women’s panties and find that another woman dressed and took them off, and they weren’t posted.”
A spokesman for Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that took place at our store in Folkstone on Tuesday, August 9.
All the goods in question have been withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks using a cow-maga
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Mizrachi, the master of the New York Cow Federation, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether it comes to you in front or back, this video will show you how to hit the robber with his own weapon.
If they come in the back, according to Mizrachi, the first thing to do is to unfold so that you can see the attacker and ‘release the line of fire’.
You then tighten the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then follow the knee in the ointment, and while the attacker bends from the pain, you turn the gun out of his hand, hit him in the face with a rod and go back, holding the weapon pointed at him.
For the armed, suitable for the front, the way to perform is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab a gun and screw it so that the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the gun and hit the attacking punch into the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before moving backwards and aiming at it.
Sounds complicated?
Take a look at the video to see exactly how the Mizrachi do it.
But remember that the safest way out of any robbery — if you’re not a master cow-maga — is to give your cash.
For the traveler, the traveler Jan Wright travels in his own language to the dirtiest places in Europe
The British traveler underwent his immune system and crunchy reflex a serious test, sweeping some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.
The head and author of books about travel, Jan Wright, 51, from Saffolk, conducted in the language of the euro banknote, the perils of the Circus Piccadilly, the toilet wash button on the train and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before sliding every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is supposed to be a film called "The Guide to the Traveler-Lisbon on the Internal Force", gave some amazing results.
The idea of slipping the wash button on a train used by thousands of others can be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and health workers about the increase in intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing from the slippery brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright has become known for testing his bowel strength, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public washing machines at the stations to the wash button of the toilet, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In the film he filmed, he said: 'From childhood I was completely careless about my health and I pulled a lot of different things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
Its test mask demonstrated the value of a luminometer exceeding 4,000 units.
For comparison: just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet, which he refused to slip, after the value of his lumen was more than 4,000 units, while the just washed hands showed less than 60.
Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio filmed a film about a traveler called "The Guide to the Internal Force Traveler-Lisuno", which demonstrates the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the toilet.
In the movie, he said, “It’s close to one of the worst things I’ve ever smelled in the toilet.”
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to sneeze at anything because it's disgusting.
The "Guide of the Traveler-Lisbon on the Internal Force" was filmed together with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company has provided Rita Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic milk bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio on snacks, juices and new categories, Nico Woorenmaa said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to look at and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming, which ended with the idea of "let's call Yan."
They argue that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about foods, we wanted to put them in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.
Growing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting form.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the film's director, added: "Let's say this: I would lose respect for Jan if he slipped some of the things I asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Of course, some of Yan’s things were easier to slip, and some were pretty tough.
I'm glad that some of these slides we managed to film."
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria exclusively to a good condition of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they consumed at least occasionally foods containing added bacillus.
The Hooligans' Family Destroyed Saltash, Cornwall Municipal House, On The Day Of Expulsion
The Hooligans' family left their municipal home with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in losses after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilcock, were expelled from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forced out of the property, shocked officials of housing and construction cooperatives found the property in a condition requiring repairs.
The walls were left with glowing holes, the shelves were opened, the garbage was scattered on the floor and the walls were smashed with graffiti.
The family is now resettled and is supposed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, a settler at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he would not be saved.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live that way.
There are a lot of things to consider because this property will probably be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys bad glory, and their name enjoys bad glory.
The couple have three sons who lived in the property from time to time, and the police report that the horror kingdom caused by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents of nearby neighborhoods, smuggling, drug use, drug trafficking, drug trafficking.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which can be taken down, old garbage was found
Floor boards in a house where drugs were sold in the past have been removed
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week, after they were granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The evacuation was welcomed with ease by neighbors who said their lives had been turned into real hell.
One said, “They didn’t care about anyone.”
We’ve lived with them for 20 years, and it’s always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is unbelievable.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Neighborhood Security Group, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and regularly called the police.
The garbage and old toys were scattered below on the enlarged side of the municipal house
He added: “It’s a shame that the tenant could not take any responsibility for her and her family’s behavior, as deportation is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very complex case, as the behavior was limiting, and their actions must have been terrifying for its observers.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police, and the community members of Devon and Cornwall have done courageously to give us information.
I hope that this development will give a little comfort to the neighbours and send a signal that associative behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all a little over 20 at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after being evicted
Relocation workers will now have to remove the chests of garbage that surrounds the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of hemp, as well as weights, accessories and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after acknowledging himself guilty of possession of class B drugs for the purpose of supply.
She said the money went to pay for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is reported that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were plastered with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to displace tenants who do not comply with the rental rules of the premises
Angela Crowe, from Devon and Cornwall police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
“This is a message for those who feel they can behave without the prosecutor’s accusations, as well as for those who are harming such behavior,” she said.
Criminal and antisocial behavior will never be tolerated by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal are horrified when a low-flying military plane barely touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro, Portugal, tourists who love sunbathing were frightened for their lives.
P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that it was conducting a training flight, but insisted that there was no risk to safety.
This is the moment when frightened tourists begin to panic, while the moment when the low-flying plane paused over the crowded beach.
Dramatic footage shows a warplane flying almost at a distance from the hunters on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The resters jumped on their feet as soon as they became concerned about the noise of the aircraft engines for obvious reasons, but were unable to see what was moving in their direction through the cloud.
The incident took place last night near the town of Aveiro in Kosta Nova.
Daniel Fernández, one of several vacationers who posted a shocking video of the flight on social media, said: "He flew quite low twice, and there was a moment when it seemed like he was going to crash."
Nuno Arroza added: “I was surfing and I swear, there was such a feeling that the plane was going to fall on me.”
Tourists on the beach of Abir were terribly frightened when the plane appeared from a mist and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was conducting a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast, and was forced to descend so low, as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said the plane flew slightly lower than usual due to insufficient visibility caused by the smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
Portugal’s air force said today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions – dense fog and smog from forest fires that deteriorated visibility.
The aircraft performed a training flight, and the pilot was commissioned to detect fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HASP system has been compulsory for the general public for more than a year, but most St. Petersburg cafes and restaurants have not yet implemented it.
The checks are becoming more active, and the business is threatened with fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP) - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for food manufacturers and carriers, as well as food companies in Russia as a member of the Customs Union.
Rospotrebnadzor’s business checks on compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials only impose fines for individual violations of the regulation (see "List of documents"...).
Non-compliance with the regulation in general will cost the company 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles - for the second.
HASP as a system that takes risks into account when working with foods and preventing them, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about food safety for astronauts.
The system is now used in all food companies not only in the United States, but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating in the territory of TS.
The business had 4 years to develop and implement the system (the requirement of HASSP appeared in the TC regulation in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials themselves admit that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
We have, unfortunately, long been convinced that the norm applies only to food production, not to restaurators, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Ceretali.
Now everyone's trying to fill out what's missing.
Expected deadline to resume charter flights to Turkey - end of August - beginning of September.
But they won’t cause a lot of demand, as their target audience – families with children – is already preparing for school, experts note.
Yesterday, the Alliance of Travel Agencies sent a letter to the government asking to allow charterers.
"For many Russian tourists, the question of choosing a quality and affordable sea holiday is insoluble, since in the resorts of Krasnodar region and the Republic of Crimea most of the accommodations are not already booked. it is the case that the stock exchanges have been made by the end of September," - note the authors of the letter.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Federation of Tourism Industry (RST), in case the aviation agencies of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
Clearly, when chartering will be resumed, as yet, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even in August, if tour operators quickly develop programs and agree with airlines on the necessary directions on board," says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-West Region.
According to him, the possible renewal of charters is good news, but it will not affect the distribution of power in the market too much, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or spending holidays in other countries.
During the bargaining season, tours are bought mostly by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously,” says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now makes very budgetary offers - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour on two, because there are people who are aimingly waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosental, CEO of the travel agency Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it is definitely not worth counting on the trip - the main mass of trips is already planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but it is not worth the wait.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal next season," says Pavel Rumyantsev.
“The opening of charters in Turkey is a positive news for the next season,” said Valeria Rubtsov.
The tax code provides for the exemption from the NDFL of the statutory compensation payments within the limits of the approved norms related to the compensation of damage caused by injury or other health damage.

London schoolgirl who joined ISIS has died in Syria <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Qadiza Sultan, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnim Akunji said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died from a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, a blockade of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“You can only hope that the only advantage of all of this – as a tombstone and a testament to others, that it is precisely the risks involved when traveling to a war zone – is to persuade people to ever make the same choice,” Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other schoolgirls from east London took a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family said she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reid says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for Supreme Court post in the event of election
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland's approval, and as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Majority leader Mitch McConnell in the Senate says the next president will choose the person who will be able to replace the last Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said at a conference call on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of confidence".
Reid later said he didn’t talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to promote Harland, and just made assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "run the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Reid said Republicans blocking Harland's nomination were "private" and "assisted" Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for the job.
Treats says erotic calendars for 'women as well as men'

"We need to go back to the demonstration of an eternal and classic nude figure, where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a wonderful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open-air castings in Los Angeles and New York.

The final consumer of vinyl: who actually buys the discs?
Lonely men of middle age love vinyl.
And until you let the section of the comments crawl with gross insults under the pseudonym Not AllSingleMen of the Middle Ages, this claim stems from the actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of the records is due not to a boom among the generation of two thousand, who want to penetrate the novel material object, but to nostalgia of the middle ages.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album c are more likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
What’s more, those who belong to the age group 18-24 are less likely.
It’s also not just an act of lovers--it has an emotional significance: senior vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings in themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were a TV news reporter, the camera would follow me while I was walking through the center of the bustling Soho Street, in a modest grey suit and heavily gestured before the stop, folding my hands and saying something impressive like:
All right, let's see.
While Soho’s heart is slowly deprived of its charm and dirt – hotels, cafes, Paperchase stores are now flooded with buildings once occupied by independent sellers – several music stores with fantastic specialists remain.
I’d probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I’m close to the different people in some of these stores and trying to estimate their age and emotional mood with the help of observation.
The birthplace of Glasgo Stuart, 55 years old, which I went from Sister Ray (counted for: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counted for: eight middle-aged men, one middle-aged woman, and probably over 20 years old) in London.
He's a collector, I ask?
“I think so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These discs, pictured above (he sent me a photo by email, I didn’t chase him home), go along the lines of the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles is partly due to his disposable income: he can now buy records that he couldn’t afford when they just came out, and redeem the items he sold when he was young and at a bargain.
“A lot of what I’m getting is the late 60s, the early 70s, the things that came out when I was 11 or 12, the things that I was probably too young to buy for,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding: “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink too much.
That's my shortcoming.
Wes, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets correspond to the YouGov profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people being influenced by media noises, people who had heard about the return and felt the duty to buy their old records.
Based on the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
“Clients who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records,” he says.
This may explain the boom among revivalists of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of discs?
It’s enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Weeze, some senior customers, in particular, are offended by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel shocked by the digital world and prefer to get rid of the constant familiar envelopes for discs, objects that awaken memories of restless youth.
“I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possessing material things as a kind of calming,” says Wes.
Since I am a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it, too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the record shelf.
An ICM poll in April showed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album last month did not listen to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this stage of news reporting, I would probably have looked seriously confused by sketching a shelf with Bosano’s teammates.
The "trophy" aspect of rebirth is what Johnny, 42, who works for Sounds of the Universe, noted.
“Someone came in recently and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
It’s not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More products, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older, a little less than twenty, who are only familiar with it.
Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire floor of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples who are over 70, tourists who photograph, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less coercive than in the aforementioned stores – the latest synthetic and sexy pop Wild Beast, not jazz improvisation, breaks through the columns – it’s nice to see diversity in its customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to establish a tortured psychological trauma by being with someone for 30 seconds.
Eleonora, 27, walked on Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available for sale.
She is looking at goods, not spending money.
She doesn’t make much money, she says, so collecting the discs is not a very suitable option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is . . .
I don’t know how to explain it – it’s truly unique.
My last stop is the store, which is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl lovers: City fashionistas.
As I create the illusion that I’m looking at jeans shorts, I’m watching a group of teenage girls gather around the Polaroid camera every minute before my father and his daughter start discussing Crosley’s purchase.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is stacked by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Flittwood Mack: a mix of modern style and classics, compulsory discs for any middle collection.
No one is looking – perhaps because they are just ornaments, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "artistic vinyl."
But considering that any attracting attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the Soho deep for a while, there’s almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the layer of population that is more likely to have more time and money than most people is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they don’t rule out the existence of a huge number of women-collectionists and vinyl lovers who exist in reality, in the record stores and on-line.
These people are likely to work in school or offices.
But they obviously don’t spend the morning of Thursday walking around the record shops on Berwick Street, slipping the records and avoiding the sights of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake driver who slaps nothing on the shoulders of middle-aged men.
Greenland's polar shark - the longest living vertebrate animal - video
Scientists say the Greenland polar shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, says the record sets a female between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects proposal to shut down shops in jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected Calais' proposal to take down dozens of homemade shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court hearings this week, the Cale authorities stated that the state should be able to bring down a total of 72 self-made stores, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (or 40 cents).
Kale Prefecture stated that these places should be taken down because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, stating that free dishes offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They stated that homemade shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those who need it.
Lille’s court ruled that there was no legitimate reason to expel the people running 72 self-made shops, but said the problems of Kale Prefecture were “completely clear.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said baccalaureates, cafes and restaurants played a much larger role than simply feeding people who “live in extremely cozy conditions.”
He said the spaces provided peaceful meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was at risk of snore was the Jungle Book Children's Cafe at the camp, which works for no profit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French lessons, and consultations on providing asylum for hundreds of vulnerable people.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect children’s cafes.
The letter to the Guardian said that its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are less than eight years of age."
Two charities, Aid for Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number in the Jungle Camp has grown to more than 9,000 people — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Microregion libraries invite young freelancers to cognitive programs.
This week, the branch libraries will hold meetings dedicated to City Day, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of Physical Culture.
The programs are aimed at the children's audience, so most of them will go in play form.
Today, August 10, the branch library No. 2, in the bay microregion, invites to the cruise presentation "My small town".
On August 11th, the Library of the 1st Branch will hold the Georgian hour "I live in this city, I know this city".
In the branch library No. 2 on the same day will be held a multimedia lesson "The land of the native past destiny".
And in the library branch No. 4 in Surazhevka - the play program "Film, film, film".
On Sunday, August 14, for the boys from the northern microregion, the library-filial No. 3 will host the game program "Physical-Hello!".
Britain stops on silver in rugby 7 after Fiji’s master class allows them to take gold
The impressive UK series in Rugby-7 was devastatingly halted at the final obstacle by the Fiji team in the final on Thursday evening, when they were completely defeated 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in possession of the ball, scoring, avoiding, supporting the game, running the lines, and rough power to win the gold – their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor comfort in the form of silver—the third in Britain a day—and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament on Rugby-7, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The painful beat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier on the same day, could return to negatively affect them in the final.
But, regardless of anything, Fiji have won in this form as no better than a team of 15.
It may be some consolation for Britain — but probably not — that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, former England boss from Wimbledon.
It was a journey to the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only one here.
These strikes will cause pain, but progress is astonishing.
Fiji started great, for fun, dismissing Britain's attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like pushing a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Colinisau plunged into the corner.
Having four minutes on the watch, Jerry Tuvay added another tachdown on the right flank, which was realized.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
A magnificent attempt to intercept Mitchell prevented Leon Nakarava from hitting third, but that only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalou made a tachdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another one after the renewal and the clock was still more than a minute ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through several more fierce attempts to intercept Britain and by assault took the line to get a point.
This resulted in a 29-0 break.
It seemed as if Fiji were born to play rugby 7, while the UK is still mastering the craft.
Which is to a large extent so.
The United Kingdom made massive half-game replacements, and they blocked the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which according to the standards of the first half was good until Joshua Twisov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton made an attempt for Britain by making a tachdown in the left corner to make the count 36-7, but the game had long followed the way of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stands.
It was impossible not to admire Fiji’s approach of full joy.
Mata William decorated a Fijian cake that didn’t need to be decorated, another attempt in the last few seconds.
There was a whisper, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier on the same day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in their semi-finals, and Britain slightly bypassed South Africa in the tense semi-finals of one attempt each – the difference British Realization.
Kyle Brown pushes the Boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, using some great legwork, broke the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
The sparkling last attempt to intercept Marcus Watson, the 15th brother of the England team, Anthony, secured a victory – and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win a cancer coach's ribbon fight
There won’t be any more exciting gold in these games, and that’s what it says.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy lifts in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added value of their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the weight, there were three voices on this boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always while they were striving for the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in British sports annals to get to that point.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th invincible performance, once again unprecedented.
What we see, two shiny athletes, sliding on the surface with the elegance of the deer, do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind each gold, a battalion of ready-made hands, contributing to gradual gains that are important, and no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, didn’t know if he would live before that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate, and they did.
If they don't, he's going everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little bit your perspective for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was fortunate to have been able to start treatment in early 2014 in the interseason, keeping the schedule gap minimal if it could be the correct expression in circumstances like these.
I needed a paycheck, so I had to fix it quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the room — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said it was enough of a few steps.
That's how it starts.
The ridge itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, the commander of the artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind the scenes, said: “I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe it’s a bit too much, but it means so much.”
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin, too.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nobody, so a huge thank you, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
This couple sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark started approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were very much in the phase.
Helen called, “Stay in the process, stay in the process.”
It is very important not to be passionate now.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn’t try to do something amazing.
We didn’t wait for the fireworks today, we just waited for us to make a good mistake and come out and win this race, as we did.
It takes a couple a year to decide their future.
Glover is due to be at her wedding next month, on her own with TV adventurer Steve Beckhall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better,” she said.
The government has extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctions products
The government extended until the end of 2017 the deadline for the destruction of foods prohibited from importing into Russia.
The relevant decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it was published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban has been extended several times and is now valid until December 31, 2017.
It is forbidden to import certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, EU countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
The use of food imported into the country to circumvent the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
Only in the first quarter of 2016, about 100 tons of banned products were seized from the sale.
The Hunting of the Forbidden
On Friday, rains and storms are expected in Moscow.
An atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, which will bring rainfall and lower the air temperature.
During the day, the air warms up to 25 degrees Celsius.
For example, on the night of Saturday in Moscow places will pass short-term rain, storms and winds up to 15 m/s are possible.
The day is expected to rain with storms and winds of up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also predicted in Orlov, Kursk and Voronezh regions, Dni.ru reports.
In the next week, rainfall is unlikely.
The WTO panel of arbitrators has found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil are contrary to the rules of the organization.
The import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia at the time of WTO accession.
“This is the first time the WTO has taken a decision against Russia,” the organization’s official website said.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia’s measures were “systematic” or “of a comprehensive nature”.
Russia, in turn, has promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which introduced additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the behavior of the United States in resolving controversial issues in the WTO undermines the principles of discussion adopted in the organization.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the Americans’ refusal to approve South Korean judge Chan Son Hwa for a second term.
In this regard, Russia will not address the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against Russia.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 for the liberalization of international trade.
It is currently comprised of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President's Administration Changed Head
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed the head of his own administration, former deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vaino.
Vladimir Putin reorganized the president’s administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, during the meeting, Anton Vaino said he considered the important anti-corruption work that he began to carry out as President Ivanov’s head of administration, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation of the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the administration is transparent and understandable and the restructuring will not fundamentally change anything in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader who has been working in the administration of the president for a long time has effectively built up the activities of the AP.
In his place came the deputy head of the administration Anton Weino - a person who knows the specifics of this work very well.
In Poland, it is allowed that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-run Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years, the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become unattractive for it due to the reorientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the vice-president of the Polish finance company Boguslaw Majets.
His words are transmitted by TASS.
“It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (at Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main delivery destinations for us will be the East, the raw materials from the LNG terminals and Norway,” Majets said.
Gazprom is currently dominant in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas, which is 30% higher than the level of 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG purchases rose to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
On 22 July, Poland’s anti-monopoly agency did not agree on the establishment of the joint venture Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline.
In the same month, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters of gas for North Stream-2.
This was stated by the vice-president of the holding board, Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the power of "North Stream-2" will take place in 2017, and in the fall of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its deposit.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom does not yet plan to take any action in connection with the intention of the Polish side to give up long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said Alexander Medvedev, vice-president of the company’s board of directors.
He reminded that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation by 42%.
Zampred "Gazprom" added that the fact of the submission of the Polish PGNIG application to the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not mean the cessation of negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
The Polish government’s commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, Petr Naimsky, said that the Polish authorities decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, Petro Naimsky, the Polish government’s commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, said that in six years, his country could give up supplies of blue fuel from the east.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new liquefied natural gas supply terminal Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
"Northern Stream-2" provides for the construction of two pipelines of a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with Crimea.
This was reported by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine, Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, responding to a relevant question from journalists, reports RIA Novosti.
According to the OSCE, the situation at the border between Ukraine and Crimea is calm, incidents affecting security are not recorded there.
Observers tracked what was happening at three passports across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a Yak-42 passenger plane landing at Ufa airport appeared on the Net, which flew outside the 400 m take-off track and crashed on the left wing.
The video was released by TV channel "360".
The event took place at 4.30 p.m. Moscow time.
The flight of KrasAvia arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place where no one was injured.
The aircraft was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport operates in the usual mode.
The Privolzh investigative control on transport of the SKR was engaged in clarifying the reason for the hard landing of the aircraft of the liner.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but UN special envoy for Syria Stefan de Mistura considers the fact of the incident uncontested.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian talks to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the attack using toxic gas, supposedly chlorine, appeared on August 2.
At the time, the opposition said that in the area where the Russian military transport helicopter was shot down earlier, the airplane dropped the bombs with the poisoning substance, but in Moscow these charges were called an intrusion.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence accused the opposition group Kharakyat Nur al-Din al-Zinki.
Soon it became known that there were two toxic gas-filled bombs.
This was confirmed by the BBC as one of the victims.
“A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, started to burn my eyes, became difficult to breathe,” the eyewitness quoted him as saying.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poisonous gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be considered a war crime.
UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters: “There’s a lot of evidence that this really happened.”
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is enshrined in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
Despite the fact that all sides of the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition” in 2015.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that the shootings in its areas are being carried out daily, and the terrorists are preventing the people from withdrawing from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in the military.
The current three-hour daily comfort regime in the organization is considered “insufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped.”
Staffan de Mistura’s humanitarian adviser, Jan Egelann, said that the 48-hour ceasefire would be required each week to deliver aid and evacuate the sick and wounded to the city.
"We have to send bulk cargoes from column trucks to areas where roads have been virtually destroyed, and what remains have been mined," Mr. Egelann said. - But the Russian delegation confirmed the readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table.
The consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian break” continue.
How Russia has opened “humanitarian windows” in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city, Russia announced on August 11 the introduction of a three-hour ceasefire regime, which will operate daily from Thursday.
The creation of “humanitarian windows” is designed to provide conditions for the delivery to the city of medicines, food and essential items.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation was taken against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the demand to reverse the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions in resorts in Thailand, four people were killed.
Several explosions broke out in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed and 19 wounded.
The epicenter of the blasts hit the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were 10 foreigners, citizens of four states, Russians are not among them.
None of the terrorist groups has yet assumed responsibility for the incident, but the country’s interior ministry has rushed to say that Islamists are not involved.
Several people have already been arrested on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the extent and specificity of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the country's military commanders.
Attacks occurred at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the area of Phuket and the city of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat-Tani.
After the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few sectors showing development.
In 2016, 14 million people visited the country, 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, police colonel Krisana Patanacharoen said.
Too early to talk about the goals, he added, but the country’s interior ministry “is confident that they are not related to international extremist groups.”
Too early to draw conclusions, said Mr. Patanacharoen.
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact they are local diversions, and we are trying to establish the identities of those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai Junction considers the protection of the monarchy one of its main priorities, so the incident is most likely directed against it.
According to police general Sithichai Srisopacharoenrat, the bombs were exploded remotely with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside the trees in the bustling streets filled with tourists dining in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who was selling street food.
The identities of the other victims are not yet known, but they are known to be residents of four foreign states.
According to the Royal Thai Police, there are four German nationals, three Dutch nationals, two Italian nationals and an Austrian national.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the Rosturism press service said.
Local experts also link the blasts to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country’s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a commission to draft a constitution appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to determine whether they would support a system in which the upper house of parliament is fully appointed by the military and plays a significant role in the election of the country’s prime minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
On May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the command of the country’s army commander Prauta Chan-Ocha.
This step, he said, was undertaken by the army through an ongoing political crisis and a lack of progress in the negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, introduced the commanding hours and censorship, dispersed the protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency.
The government of Thailand, headed by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat, announced in January 2014 the introduction of the state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces adjacent to the capital.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
There were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions in central Bangkok near the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, left 28 people injured, five of whom were in critical condition.
Explosions caused by unknowns on motorcycles.
The authorities reinforced security measures in the capital and attracted military forces to protect the protesters.
The development of conditions began in the Dry Lodge.
As it became known, the Government was invited to agree to the draft auction terms for the gold mine of Dry Log with the preservation of two key restrictions.
The auction is proposed not to allow companies where 25% or more belong to foreigners, and those applicants whose capital does not have at least 25% of the nationality.
Participants in the industry do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and will be held in October.
The Ministry of Nature submitted to the government the draft order and conditions of auction for the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia Dry Log (Irkutsk region, stocks and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources "Y" familiar with the situation said.
The project was submitted on Wednesday evening, clarified one of them.
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project was submitted to the government.
A spokeswoman for Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Kloponin, who cared for the submarine, said "yes" that the project had not yet entered the official's apparatus.
"The auction can be announced as early as August, immediately after the government's order is issued, and given the deadline for the collection of applications of potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender can be held as early as October," the Ministry of Nature said.
According to the "<0xD0><0x95>" data, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, prescribed in the variant, which was sent to the ministries and the FOIV in July (have "<0xD0><0x95>").
The first is the presence in the capital of the applicants at least 25% of the state.
The second is the refusal to access the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 of non-investment in strategic societies.
According to the two specified in the draft articles of the FZ, as already written "<0xD0><0x95>" on August 2, the auction may not be allowed to companies whose beneficiaries (25% shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, as Dry Log refers to undergrounds of federal value (reserves of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies", but refused to comment on details before the government's order.
The claim of state participation in the capital of the auction participants was put forward by the Irkutsk region, said in December 2015 "<0xD0><0x95>" in the Ministry of Nature and later confirmed by the governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor Sergey Eroshe.
Who lobbyed the restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors "<0xD0><0x95>" do not specify.
"But it is in the spirit of time: not to give control in Russia's largest gold mine against the background of Western sanctions," - argues the interviewer, familiar with the preparation of the auction.
On August 1, the head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donskaya, stated that foreigners "can go to the consortium" if the candidates attract them "as a financial structure, technology partners".
Interviewers say it is unlikely that the conditions will be adjusted in the government.
The main contender for the Sukh Log in the industry is considered the consortium of the largest gold mining company of the Russian Federation "Polyus", controlled son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and "Rostech".
As he wrote "<0xD0><0x95>", in July, the partners created S.L. Gold, where "Polyus" shares 51%, the structure "Rostech" RT-GR - 49%.
In "Rostech" declined to comment, in "Polyus" stated "<0xD0><0x95>" that "of course, are interested in this asset" and have all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the terms," Polus added.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision by the Russian government, said sources "<0xD0><0x95>".
The possibility of participating in the development of the Dry Log was stated by the Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, which is developing assets at Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to the "<0xD0><0x95>", are not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, the head of the Russian Gold Industry Union, Sergei Kashuba, assessed the investment in Dry Log at <0x24>2.5-4 billion.
Most potential candidates are not only intimidating by the volume of investment, but also the complexity of the project: it requires serious inventory exploration and technology to work with complex mines, explain the industry’s “I” interlocutors.
In the pension market, the largest M&A transaction was launched - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" launched the process of merging the four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of the "Gazfonds Pension Funds" will be created NPF with a accumulation volume of about 373 billion rubles.
On the launch of the procedure of merging of four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagrofond", "Heritage" and "Gazfonds Pension Funds" - yesterday the owner of 100% of the funds of LLC "KIT Finance Pension Administrator".
"The reorganization is carried out in accordance with the CB with the requirement of non-deterioration of the terms of the current treaties," - said in the statement of the company.
The merger is carried out on the basis of the "Gazfonds Pension Acquisitions".
As noted by the director-general of this NPF, Oleg Byaloshitskiy, the pooling of funds allows to solve several tasks: expanding the geography of the presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, disseminating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the approximate term of completion of consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF "Gazfonds Pension Funds" will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As of March 31, the amount of pension accumulations of the combined funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the report on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through controlled LLC owns 65%) and NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, only the group's merger launched much later competitors.
Thus, the O1-controlled group NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalfond" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NPF joins the Uralsib and Russian Standard Foundations.
“The unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary for the solution of structural problems,” notes Nikolai Sidorov, the director-general of NPF Future.
Active work on the consolidation of funds has been going on since April and in the pension group "Safmar" - NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regional Fund" should be included in NPF "Safmar" by the end of this year.
In 2017, they will join the NPF "Doverie".
“The pooling of funds will have an effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and expenses,” the Safmar pension group said.
The break in the pooling of funds, which was endured by the "KIT Finance Retirement Administrator", can be caused by several reasons, the experts say.
Until recently, NPFs had not been able to redeem more than 40% of the volume of infrastructure bonds that the group had actively hosted.
After amendments to the ECB’s regulation in March of this year on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator, such restrictions no longer exist.
If necessary, the entire edition can be purchased by one major player," - says the director of the rating group of AKRA financial institutions Yuri Nogin.
Several of the top 15 asset managers of the NPF have another possible reason for the breakup called the division of spheres of influence and, as a result, the appointments of staff in a single fund, which the group owners had to agree.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comments.
The "I" request to the NPF "Gazfonds" was also not answered.
Although the consolidation of funds is a labor-intensive and inexpensive activity, on the long run this decision will be justified.
As noted by the general director of the consulting company "Pension Partner" Sergey Okolesnov, the "Pension Fund" has fewer outflows, joining will stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, more successful experience of the NPF "KIT Finance" and "Promagrofond" in the construction of retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software will be required.
CB requirements for NPF processes and staff are constantly growing, so duplicating infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy is not appropriate, says CEO of corporate ratings "RA Expert" Pavel Mitrofanov.
"The effect of reducing duplicating functions will definitely overlap the possible costs of merging," - notes Mr. Mitrofanov.
The cost of the merger of four funds Sergei Okolesnov estimated at 30-50 million rubles.
"The cost of holding four such funds amounts to about 400 million rubles per year, with consolidation in the medium term, the budget will actually be reduced by two," - Mr. Okolesnov is sure.
The best Disney movie "Pitt and his Dragon" was released in the Russian rental.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the soothing dragon, the soothing story and country-style songs are enough to believe in old-fashioned magic again, says Elena Kravtsun.
The frightened child was picked up by a dragon, who became a human child and a gentle nurse, and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of the puppy from a fairy tale book, plays with him in the back yard and falls asleep in the picture.
Six years later, he has grown up and is in a tight bond, not to be distinguished from another deliberate forest squirrel - Maughly.
In this form, Pete is discovered by a red-haired woman, Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while Gavin's brigade (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively forests.
Now she will have to not only believe in the existence of the dragon, but also help him save.
Pete undergoes an accelerated course of “being a man” surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, a moral code in their heart and smile more blindly than in any advertisement.
None of the characters look or act too awful for the viewer to really start hating or frightening him.
Even Gavin, who opened the hunt for an untypical habitat of subordinate forests, is far from an irreparable villain.
The huge rifled dragon also turned out not to be at all terrifying, with a good bulldog's morbidity, the airline's wingspan and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon laughs, whispers, even whispers and, fortunately, does not speak, but he always wants to be swallowed, so he is beneficially different from all the famous cinematic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of holding up provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments begin to cry desperately in three arms not only small spectators, but also adults.
Surprisingly good and young Oaks Figli in the role of Pete, splitting between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford is virtuously giving up a canonical grandfather who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to shoot a fantastically cute remake of the 1977 Disney movie "Dragon Pete" that was middle-of-the-nose to the end of the tail and remembered only with a mix of animation and play?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
In his painting Lowry from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There were music numbers on board and a lot of weird jokes.
This good tale reads features borrowed from "Baby", "The Alien" and many other cute children's heart paintings.
The Disney studio continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality 21st century remakes.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon is not as stunningly beautiful as the Jungle Book, and there is no expert villain like Kate Blanchett in the role of a kitten in the new "Wildman".
But this naïve film is no less successful in helping to believe in miracles and goodness in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys from the magical castle Disney director Lowry will receive again - for an artistic film adaptation of the story of Peter Pane.
David Lowry and the screenwriter Toby Helbrooks are part of a new ambitious project about an immature boy based on the story of James Barry.
Journalist of RBC Aleksandr Sokolova will be brought on a new charge
Advocates of RBC journalist Aleksandr Sokolova, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, said that the prosecutor's office found shortcomings in their defense case.
That the prosecutor's office made such a statement, we learned from the investigators literally yesterday.
We were scheduled to attend a court hearing on the issue of limiting access to the criminal case materials, but the hearing did not take place in the end, and the investigators informed us about the presentation made by the prosecutor’s office,” - RBC said lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said that the prosecutor ' s office had pointed to the investigators for non-qualification of the case and the collected material.
Now the investigators will have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and present a new charge to Alexander Sokolov.
Either there will be another article of the Criminal Code, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Mrs. Dinze clarifies.
As reported by "I", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation ruled out from the accusations of the journalist RBC the wording of "deterioration of the political situation towards instability" and "unlawful overthrow of power".
Aleksandr ZILBERT, a correspondent for "Commersantoboscosport", lived the life of an Olympic athlete in the Olympic village, inspected the home of the Russian team, ate lunch at a local dining room and even passed the WADA test after that.
I don't think life's dying here for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end at midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, settlement and expulsion are carried out without a stop, as some athletes complete their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only arrive here.
Well, at 7:30 a.m., one of the temporary tents will be held by the heads of all Olympic delegations.
At these meetings we usually discuss some operational domestic issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Olympic team of Russia Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house, in which the demontaje were housed, is considered to be an example - it was given in the first instance.
The problem with hot water, the problem, sorry, the toilets.
We fought for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then came the clerks, but they just squeezed some substance on the floor, and all.
They have floors, you see, some innovative ones.
Mole, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these floors are plain laminate!
Overall, there have been changes to the Clining Company and now it's okay.
The Olympic village is South Butovo, a sleeping area, fenced on one side of the mountains, on the other - an impressive cove, places filled with water.
Well, for reliability, there is still a two-meter iron fence throughout the perimeter, along which the automatons walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely dedicated to the needs of our team.
Looking at the small hallway at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems seem to be the most urgent for the domestic team.
There are two ads on the registration rack: printed "Please don't throw the paper in the toilet!" and by the hand "Receive in gift badges.
The stand itself drowns in booklets.
Their cheerful bloom contrasts with the headings of the brochures: "Memorandum of Infectious Diseases for Travelers to Rio de Janeiro", "First Aids in Distressing, Infection of a Stranger Body", "Relaxation, Loss of Consciousness" - stages of the heart.
The text on the inside is quite encouraging.
For example: "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent treatment.
However, not everyone expects a favorable outcome.
Of course, in the location of the team of Russia there is a medical center, which at any time is ready to provide the residents of the house with qualified assistance, including relaxation and sports massage.
Contrary to the medical center, it is the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster "No matter what, we will win!".
Well, of course, the poems:
All the arguments are absolute nonsense!
They only believe in those who are afraid.
Let us less, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, it will not break!
And for an even greater lifting of the spirit there is a proclamation: “Dear brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia Kirill, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Olympic team of Russia is carried out by the proto-priest Andrei Vladimirovich Alexeyev.
You can order requests and other requests by phone...
In general, the village has a Center for Meditation and Religious Rites for representatives of all faiths.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the loading of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to be used during the fire.
And in the dark, he stumbled upon the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were the sleeping employees of the new clinical company.
I think in readiness at any time to drop on the washing of innovative floors they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold staircase.
On the fourth floor I was waiting for a meeting with a long-time acquaintance - Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our batutists, who led them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his schoolgirl, the European champion Jana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show her rooms.
Complaining about the big account is not something, - shares the impressions deserved coach of Russia. - We live on two, beds, of course, are almost inclined, but it is not critical.
Sanusel one in four, but still spacious.
The closet, of course, is funny, made of fabric, does not cause trust, but things can be put.
"No, well, you're hanging out, they're done with tea!" - Svetlana Kuznetsov, a tennis player who I met at the main dining room.
The main one is called at least because it is a space of 2.7 thousand square meters and is ready to welcome 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There are over 60,000 servings of it all free of charge.
The menu options are: "Best of Brazil", "Cooking of the World", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, macaroni products".
The last version, as I’ve seen, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, let's say, I haven't found soups in any of the units of a giant restaurant.
- What soups? - Kuznetsov is surprised. - No tea!
I'm glad I took the Chinese with me, welder.
And a teapot.
But in general, for you to understand, we have even worse food on the courts.
You can choose something here, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I personally chose a chip for a couple and fries in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish is a table with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the food value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, to admit it was edible.
I don’t even understand why this line is always in the local McDonald’s.
Sick, relaxed, you can say "warm" athletes at the exit of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They are tricked into catching a Victorian, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
Provoked, I can say!
To get a gift, you need to answer at least eight out of ten questions correctly.
There are questions in Russian! – attacked me by a WADA girl.
But I didn't attack him.
I mean, I was in a patriotic rush, of course.
The situation has been exacerbated by the second question: “If I have been notified of a doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?”
I stopped at option B: "No, I have one hour."
I lost, so to speak, my vigilance.
I’ve forgotten that there’s no need to wait for WADA’s weakening.
In general, you need to be right away.
Well, in the seventh stage of the Victoria, my position has become quite critical.
I thought for some reason that if I’d find it hard to follow a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and I’m, by the way, hard!), then I can use bio supplements to get “additional nutrients to improve my performance.”
No, they're not allowed!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is not categorically forbidden, but insistently, in several proposals respond.
WADA plays this unfairly!
So, what's up, Russia? - questioned the leading Victorian.
To retreat nowhere - behind Efimov, Isinbaev and all our unveiled team.
That’s why I concentrated and won an unhappy t-shirt from the last few forces.
You know, as they say, ours!
In a win-win mood, I went to the neighborhood fitness center.
Involved by the counting of the trainers.
I fell to 250.
Surprisingly, he noted that there was not a single Russian athlete found in this racetrack.
But maybe it's right?
Let's train someone who can't play!
And there was one of our guys sitting next to the polyclinic.
In line with the ophthalmologist.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In the polyclinic, however, as throughout the village, wherever the plums are, the apparatus for the extraction of condoms hangs.
There is an inspiring exclamation: "Celebrate with a condom!"
It remains only to rotate the iron resembling the door lock handle, and the condom made of natural Amazon latex is ready to fall out of the machine.
I took myself alone, in memory.
The athletes will not lose - they have taken them 450,000.
It is precisely for the festive and leisure time in the Olympic Village there is a whole entertainment center.
At the same time, there is a sign that reminds me that the International Olympic Committee is spending <0x24>3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some odd devices similar to video trainers.
I am interested in a fellow in the form of a Ukrainian team, which actively uses a wild toy.
I could, of course, just say that he does not want to talk to a man in the form of a team of Russia, and everything.
Here, by the way, by some strange accumulation of circumstances in the eyes of the boys in yellow-blue.
The most playing team, it turns out.
To get around the whole village, looking at each corner of it, it takes no less than three hours.
But if it is not for walking, and not for electric cars, you will also open the house of a Canadian team with a loose at the entrance and a tent with a restorative bath, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and a laundry room, and a hairdresser's counter, and a flower shop, and a store with a store of goods.
And late in the evening you, obessile, will sit next to an olive tree enveloped with colorful tapes in memory of the friends and relatives of athletes who have left this world.
And you'll be accompanied by a machine, a mess of spraying fluid to kill insects, thinking of eternal.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was breathtakingly watching as the Australians had barely punished the American Dream Team, real fans went on the net.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglazov won the gold in the rapper at the XXXI Olympics, I got the first.
Maybe I’m even the only moscovite to see this happen, except for those who, of course, watched the competition in Carioca that night.
This can only be understood by a true fan.
Imagine: a deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors downstairs – as always at night – wake up and start screaming innocuously, but very loudly.
Threatening to move furniture.
The crane flows in the kitchen - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as requested by the sanitary technician, a new one.
Nothing is understood in the TV schedule, so just kept in control of the channels "Match", "First" and in any case "Russia" - although it is almost pointless.
"Russia" - the family of repeats, the whole sport is there for some reason in the records.
The series is broadcast on live streams.
Hope, of course, at the "Match" - all evening young man shouted in news releases first about the big semifinal Deriglazov--Shanaev, then about the upcoming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is the U.S.-Australia.
By the way, I can't say anything wrong about this decision.
The Australians were on equal footing, the first half overall won.
They were placed in the place of the Americans of their own greatness.
As a result, they still lost, but as they say now, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but the battle with DiFranciska is approaching, and on the screen, unchanged.
In a little panic, I start to spread the channels.
This is the feeling, the second time in a row.
All right, let's go deeper into the cables.
None of the thematic "Mothers" have a fist.
In my opinion, the fight is about to begin.
The text and tweets of some sports sites do not suit me.
Sailing surfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the website "First", it turns out, the direct technical broadcast of all competitions that are taking place at this time.
I'm clicking on the fist, I'm getting a fight for gold.
Deriglazov counterattacks perfectly, goes ahead with his glasses - and obviously starts to pull time.
The Italian plays almost the entire game.
Ours at one point ahead, a little over two seconds to the end.
Di Francesca throws at Deriglazova, she retreats, time runs out, the Italian woman scolds.
Victory!
A few seconds later, an Olympic messenger on the phone announces the fourth gold medal.
I was the first to see it with my own eyes.
Crazy, loyal, involved.
Tatarstan’s Muslim Spiritual Authority (DUM) refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM plenum forced its imams to preach only in Tatar to force the young Tatars to “learn their native language”.
The administration says it "does not under any circumstances violate" the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, the Kazans say that up to 60% of the Tatars do not understand the language, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
The Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar “will not reach the whole audience.”
Yesterday, the plenary of DUM Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in Tatar language.
As Tatarstan Mufti Kamil Samigullin said, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to “learn their native language.”
“For those who say ‘difficult’ in every major mosque, we intend to organize Tatar language lessons absolutely free of charge,” Samigullin said.
He added that “the decision has already come into effect” and today in all mosques the sermons “must be in Tatar.”
He recalled that DUM Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shura" with typical sermons in Tatar language.
Imam, who does not speak well enough in the Tatar language, “can prepare thoroughly for them.”
DUM Tatarstan brings together more than a thousand revenues in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the Mufti, the Friday sermons are held exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques previously used predominantly Russian.
In particular, as the Mufti pointed out, it was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, Zakabanna and Eniler.
However, Mr. Mohametshin stressed, the leadership sets the task for all students to speak both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"No harm to a Muslim-Netatar can be spoken of," Mr. Mohametshin said, explaining that the sermon itself "is not a mandatory, essential part of prayer."
At the same time, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, lectures and lessons in Russian will be preserved in the mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Mohametshin said that there was no serious threat of expulsion of the Tatar language from the mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are not used in the sermons in the republic.
The decision of DUM was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WCT).
Chief Executive of VKT Rinat Zakirov said "I": "Dreams are an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language had left this sphere.
He noted that the conduct of sermons only in the Tatar language "the desire of the imams themselves", but in the executive of the WCT "this is considered right".
The "I" imams, who gave sermons in Russian, are ready to execute the decision of the DUM, but believe that the relatives will have difficulty understanding the clergy.
Both the Tatars and the Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
They will, of course, be sad.
"It is necessary to reconstruct," says the Imam of the Burnaev Mosque Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, the preaching in Russian is even closer to many Tatars, as "Russian in both schools, and in kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere is original".
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We trust in God.
God will show you the way out of this situation,” he concluded.
Approximately 60% of us don’t speak Tatar.
These are both Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
There are a lot of foreign students coming to us: Africans, Arabs.
“That’s why we’ve been in Russian for four years,” Imam says.
He believes that the sermons in the Tatar language will “come to a narrower circle and not reach the entire audience.”
But we will obey the Plenum's decision.
The results of the sermons will be different.
But time will show.
“For example, it will only be easier for me because the Tatar language is my native language,” Gabdulla Galiullin concluded.
Former FSIN director has been sued
The Moscow Prosecutor’s Office has approved the indictment on the investigated GSU SCR criminal case on the theft of budget funds allocated to the needs of the Russian FSIN.
The former head of the prison department, Alexander Reimer and his deputy, will appear before the court, which caused damage to the FSIN in the amount of more than 2.7 billion rubles.
The Prosecutor's Office has sent a criminal case to the Zamoskvoretsky Court against the former Director of the FSIN of Russia Alexander Reimer, his former Deputy Nikolay Kryvolapov, as well as the Director of the FGUP's Office of the Center for Information and Communications (Center of Information and Communications)
Depending on the role and the degree of participation in the crime, they are charged with the GSU of the SCR in Moscow under article 3 of the 285 U.S.C. (abuse of official powers, which has had serious consequences), article 4 of the U.S.C. 159 of the U.S.
In addition, Kryvolapov is accused under article 1 of 222 of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, in 2010-2012, those persons were fraudulently hijacked from the state execution the budget funds allocated to the FSIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
For the theft of budget money, the members of the group developed a scheme according to which the FGUP CITOS, which is controlled by them, with which the relevant state contracts were concluded, produced non-technical control and supervision tools, including "electronic sweeps" and "sweeps".
Despite the fact that FGUP CITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, facilities for the placement of production facilities, allowing to create a completed cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", between it and FSIN Russia were five state contacts in the amount of more than 3.3 billion rupees.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles were in the accounts of the Samara branch of the FGUP, of which 1.2 billion rubles were abducted.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles of cash recovered was received personally by Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the accomplices, the criminal case for which was allocated in separate proceedings.
Nikolai Kryvolapov, who participated in the maneuvers, was found of unknown origin of the bullet to the award-winning gun, which allowed him to present an additional charge.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN filed a claim for compensation for material damages amounting to 2.7 billion rubles to the accused.
Soccer player Hakan Shukyur is suspected of being involved in the coup.
Turkish authorities have issued an arrest warrant for the former footballer, then a member of parliament, Hakan Shukyur, and searched the two houses of his family.
The Turkish football star of the 1990s - early 2000s attacker Hakan Shukur is being sought by the country's authorities in connection with an attempted coup d'état last month.
Forward, who finished his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an "armed terrorist group".
It is about the movement "Hizmet" - a society associated with the well-known Turkish religious figure and opposition leader Fethullah Gülen.
It is President Erdogan who is the organizer of the military coup attempt on July 15.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, a warrant was issued today for the arrest of Hakan Shukyur, the police have already searched two houses belonging to the former footballer’s family.
According to the investigation, Fethullah Gülen's organization included, in addition to Hakan Shukyur himself, his father.
However, neither the former footballer nor his relatives were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
In essence, footballer Hakan Shukuru defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and played for the country's team.
He spent most of his career at the Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes the Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as the English "Blackburn".
He hasn’t spent more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukur remains Turkey’s most successful striker to date: in his assets 112 matches for the national team and 51 goals.
In 2013, Hakan Shukuru left his deputy post because of the ongoing corruption investigation into Erdogan’s party and its surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists were ordered to be arrested in Turkey on July 25.
They are accused of supporting a military coup and ties with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the United States.
Given the severity of the charges, media officials can expect long prison terms - from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.

The Russian copper company (RMK) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMK has undertaken the modernization of one of the country’s oldest and environmentally “dirty” enterprises – the Karabakh honeycomb.
The Karabakh honeycomb plant was founded by the English stock company led by Leslie Urquart in 1910.
In Soviet times it was a significant industrial enterprise for the economy of the country, and it actually provided the life of the entire city.
However, in the 1990s due to financial problems, production was halted, resulting in serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabakh copper mill.
It was also necessary to address one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - the environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company went under the control of the Russian copper company.
The company began to modernize production, which gradually reduced the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the governor of Chelyabinsk region Boris Dubrovnik, who visited in the first numbers of July "Karabashmed".
The head of the Southern Urals called the major changes that have occurred with the company since "Karabashmedh" became the RMC group.
The main event for the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sulphur-acid workshop, which allows to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian copper company Vsevolod Levin, the volume of investment in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of the modernization of Karabashmed ZAO is the reconstruction of the conversion process.
The replacement of three converters, pulverizers and gas pipelines is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new workshop for cleaning industrial goods worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amounts of taxes deducted from the budget of the city of Karabakh will also increase.
During the entire period of implementation of the Tominsky GOKa project - from the start of the construction and before the second row is put into operation - the federal penalty will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the introduction of the GOK into operation, the revenue of taxes in the budgets of all levels can amount to 80.9 billion rubles.
For the year of production in the Varna region, 346.3 million rubles were allocated to budgets of different levels.
And that's for the first year.
"The longer the enterprise operates successfully, the more the amount of levies can be", - added Valery Ulanovsky.
In RMK clarified that in 2015 the tax deductions from Mikheevsky GOK were close to 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of RMK enterprises in the life and development of the territories of their presence is not limited to tax deductions.
RMK enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, to build cultural and entertainment facilities, to refurbish territories.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabakh became a major renovation, and in fact - almost complete renovation of the kindergarten N9 for 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of emergency.
Also on the territory of "RMK Arena" will be housed a landscape park with artificial grass, underground and ground parking spaces for 600 car seats, cafes and sports shops.
"RMK Arena" will allow to hold spectacular professional sports events of the international level.
But the main task of this project is to make physical training and sports classes in comfortable conditions accessible to the residents of Chelyabinsk, especially for children.

WSJ: The U.S. is considering imposing sanctions against Russia for hacking Democrats’ servers.
U.S. officials are considering imposing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of Democratic Party servers, The Wall Street Journal writes, referring to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama will have to officially accuse Russia of attacking servers or Russian-backed hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence services are almost certain of Russia’s involvement in the cyberattack.
WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to name those who carry out hacking attacks.
The exception is the 2014 hacking of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, for which the responsibility was officially entrusted to the North.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure to impose sanctions on those who carry out or promote cyberattacks.
It was originally targeted against China, but can also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions can be lengthy, the publication writes.
Even if the officials concluded that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose the information.
They have to determine whether an incident is so serious that it can exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was reported that Barack Obama’s administration allowed the possibility of sanctions against a state whose hackers hacked into the Democratic Party’s National Committee servers.
WikiLeaks has published an e-mail from the National Committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in the hacking.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was a violation of competition in the mobile app market.
Antimonopoly proceedings were initiated on the initiative of Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibit pre-installing apps from other developers, in particular from Yandex.
The FAS found confirmation of these claims and established that the company abused the dominant position in the market and imposed on mobile manufacturers the installation along with the Google Play store of other apps.
Following the verification, the Federal Antitrust Service decided to punish Google, according to FAS head Alexey Docenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that the Competition Protection Act should be respected by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to first study the solution and only then determine with the next action: to execute it or to dispute it.
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service recognized the company as a violation of the competition law in September last year and ordered to adjust the contracts until December 18.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a global deal.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This opinion was expressed by the head analyst of Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would not affect either the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

The attacker joined the woman and hit the victim several times with a brick on the head.
A 29-year-old man died on the spot.
The accused confessed partially.
For now (August 12, 2016), this is all information.

OSCE observers have not recorded military activity at the Crimea border.
Observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) did not record military activity on the Russian-Ukrainian border.
This is stated in a statement published on the organization’s website.
Observers report that the situation at the border of Crimea is calm, incidents that may somehow be related to the security of Ukraine and Russia have not been recorded.
“None of the observers was able to confirm media reports that concern security issues, including shooting and military action in close proximity to the administrative border,” the OSCE report said.
The organization’s employees continue to monitor the situation at three crossing points at the border in the area of the Ukrainian cities of Kalanchak, Chaplinka and the Chongar peninsula in the Sivas Bay.
Earlier in the State Border Service of Ukraine, it was reported that the rotation of Russian troops at the border of Crimea is ending.
At the same time, it is claimed in the office that the updated personal composition has more advanced technology.
Bulgaria shows inflation for the first time in 8 months
Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% per month in July, according to national statistics.
This is the highest figure for years (since June 2012) and the first high of zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was shown.
The average annual inflation measured in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, there was an increase in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and regular maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications systems; and education.
The “Anime” effect of Snapchat criticised as cartoon on Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some viewers say it is racially flawless.
Using the “Lenses” tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border with absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character to paint a picture of Roy Lichtenstein.
The lenses are rough, distorting features of the tools that create more than 30 million adjusted selfies a day.
Any mistakes are quickly becoming commonplace.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising dark skin on their face or encouraging whitened faces as a beauty ideal.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them their hairy eyes, curved teeth and tumbling gums, some critics saw it as a racist cartoon on Asians - "jams."
And they wondered whether these repeated contradictions pointed to a more serious problem of the company related to diversity.
On Wednesday, the news spread, followed by outrage in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented: the lens was designed as a tribute to the anime characters, not as a cartoon on Asians.
But experts who know about racism are unheard of, the lens reminded of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others have completely rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about photographs were actively shared, said the lens was "offensive and at least uncomfortable."
She added that “it’s hard to argue with a comparison side by side of a very rough cartoon on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowish, but, to a higher degree, destructive yellowish.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate halls to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diverse than their older generation — may mean that they are more likely to expect understanding.
When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katy Zhu said, “it’s much harder for such a course of events to remain unnoticed than it used to be.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working at Medium, decided to remove her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial contradictions are the cause of insufficient diversity in recruitment in Snepchat.
Zhu criticized the company’s predominantly white men-only leadership and ended her article with a hashtag: <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, who is an American of Chinese descent, wrote: “Either they didn’t have enough white people in the state who could make such decisions, or they’re working white people, but they don’t occupy positions that can be safely and secured.”
Other viewers share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss its staff’s racial background, but according to a trusted person, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and active attempts to involve internal resources.
Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, “I’m wondering if they really need more users like us so they can say that’s not going to happen.”
Military leadership has distorted intelligence about ISIS, Congressional commission reports
U.S. Armed Forces Central Command officials have modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the grounds for the event on the ground, the congressional commission said in a report.
The interim report of the operational group, established by the Republican chairpersons of the House of Representatives Committee on Military Affairs, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Subcommittee, has found that the "committee's assessments of their common dissatisfaction" among the intelligence analysts
The Central Command, known as the Center, is the main military command in the city of Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence documents approved by the CDC’s senior command generally gave a more optimistic picture of the US anti-terrorist actions than confirmed by real data from the scene of the events, and were more optimistic than the analysis provided by the other party,” the report said.
“What happened in the Centcom is unacceptable: when the senior leadership appears to be unreliable analysis, our military is suffering,” said Senator Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Problems with management in the Centre reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-hour report describes in detail the irregularities that occurred in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analyzing the U.S. actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration have ordered the reports to be falsified, it claims that analysts have felt that the Centre leadership is forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State as well as the Islamic State.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony by the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than real events,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is known for certain," said Republican Republican Mike Pompeo in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the U.S. Central Command’s top intelligence executives falsified the command’s intelligence documents to minimize the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up an operative group when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, according to a report published Thursday, more elaborate data will follow.
An additional, yet unfinished investigation into the intelligence of the Centre is carried out by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the U.S. House of Representatives’ Intelligence Committee released their own data on Thursday, which is in line with some of the Republican operative group’s findings.
“Between 2014 and 2015, the Centre established an overly closed procedure for producing intelligence assessments of ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, a senior representative of the Democratic Party in the committee.
This procedure, according to Schiff, “has blocked the release of intelligence documents,” damaged the moral state of analysts and “reflected insufficiently different views.”
But Schiff and Democrats claim they have found no evidence that the White House was trying to force analysts at the Centre to uphold their findings under "determined or political interpretation."
The preliminary results of the Congressional inquiry were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon’s chief inspector, which opened after complaints from CENTCOM analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defence would not comment on the congressional report as the Chief Inspector's investigation continues.
But he said that “experts sometimes differ in opinion when interpreting comprehensive data, and the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues related to national security.”
The consequences of the investigation are beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing targets in Iraq and Syria are being achieved (as more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence are now claiming).
But last year’s statements raise doubts as to whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Intelligence critics of the 2003 Islamic State repeated the controversy that took place more than a decade ago, when Center for Intelligence Analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article in which he claimed that the administration of President George W. Bush was instigating that he was instigating for a long time.
Hooker has also played a key role in the protest caused by Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, according to officials, the Hooker team came to the conclusion that despite public statements about the reverse, airstrikes on oil-producing plants belonging to the Islamic State did not lead to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the non-Islamic State.
But the discovery was not widespread outside the Central Command, the Times reported in September.
The then-Centcom commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many deputies saw as an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in the Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins 4 consecutive times in women's hockey on grass, thereby approaching decisive battle with Britain
Having once scored three goals in the game, which ended with a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Beam opened her first two goals for the U.S. women's hockey team on the grass on Thursday, when the Americans won a 3-0 win over the Indian team.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27, says she’s not sure if she’ll ever do something like that.
"I'm not going to put my mind down," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keep track of their goals.
This is what she knows: the Americans 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they are competing for the first place in their group against Britain, which remains unbeaten after Japan lost 2-0 on Thursday.
The UK and US teams will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams qualify for the quarter-finals, and the result of the game will determine who will occupy the first place in their group of six teams and who will be the second.
The winner will avoid meeting with a strong team of opponents from the Netherlands, the leaders of another group, a little bit of weather when the quarter-finals start.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made a noise with their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, took a hockey cap for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played this sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she didn't take a selection tour to the final team.
Then came 2012, when she and her teammates didn’t get it all right.
The following year, Coeyg Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed a coach, and everything began to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical fitness,” Bam said.
In London, we didn’t have the productivity we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game by throwing with an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India came to the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative.
She made a long pass with the ball down on the left side of the field, then spiral in the middle and sharply sent the ball to the goal, thereby giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa González added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" victory was the first in the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
Just like Bam.
“We’re in a good position right now,” Parnham said, but how good it depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
In the midst of the unhappiness of the Olympics - "the" jumps on the boot
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, it’s the Olympics.
Events in Rio de Janeiro seem unchanged and inevitable, it’s a furious combination of competition and ambition.
The Olympic fire itself is the burning torch that is transmitted from the archer to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlet.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors’ conversations in a cafe or hear about Simon Bailes, Katy Ledeki, or the enmity between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And then there's Logan Dulley.
Duly, who first participated in the Olympics, a beauty boy with punches on his cheeks, could quite well be among those celebrities shown in the praim-time, promoted by sponsors and fnashals more life-affirming commercials, if he was a swimmer, or gi swimmer.
But 28-year-old Duly from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic jumping competitions.
The Olympic fire does not illuminate all events equally.
Far from the center, partly in the shadow, are those sports that are not generally recognized: a shot from a pneumatic gun, a shot from an arc, a badminton, a tekvondo.
Brass will always be with us, a long reign for him.
But if I'm allowed to speak softly in defense of my personal addiction, let me turn your attention to the modest charm of jumping on the boot.
Although jumping on boots has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney Games, in the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people I interviewed were unaware that they belong to the Olympic sports at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in jumping on the boot, and their athletes didn’t come out in the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share men’s prizes with each other, while the Chinese and Canadians are women’s.
Dun Dun from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But the jumps on the boots have the charm of an outsider, especially because for the uninformed ear they are associated with a circus college rather than the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit that I'm not an expert, but just a grounded enthusiast.
They really have comedic potential — it’s a cartoon of endless jumps — but also the elegance of gymnastics and water jumps, two sports that they basically combine in themselves.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín", which means "trample for jumping into the water".
Winners jump on a giant boot, flying almost 30 feet in the air, and have to perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and salto) until the final landing on their feet.
They are assessed by performance, complexity and "flight time", according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is ahead of us.
Candidates for the medal have to go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, all over the field.
They aim not only at the finish line or the starting wall, but also, as seen by the TV cameras, to another irritating frontier: the world or Olympic record.
This persistent pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic—and enough to make even the spectator crawl.
But it is, in my opinion, a bit tired of watching the Games.
Jumping on the shoe gives him a breath.
The battist’s direction is up.
Movement forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, seems as weightless as an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And in them, of course, is not without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no crazy rush to the finish, no leaps in length, only a strange, exquisite disappearance of time and gravity.
This is the closest Olympic sport to Zen.
The women's qualifying competitions, and then the finals will take place on Friday afternoon, broadcast in the hour of day Eastern European time; the men - on Saturday, also in the hour.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the day program starting at 2:00 p.m. on both days.
At the brink of Olympic madness is expected a calm, beautiful moment that can easily be seen in the common garbage.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by subjecting male athletes to deliberate views and objectification – as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by gymnasts from the United States – Duli is only waiting for his new admired crowd of fans.
“Generation Protests” in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Angry protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced a fierce confrontation on the part of the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally wounded during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the brink of division?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a strong ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have gone to the streets, demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the government’s reaction was cruel.
Eyewitnesses claimed that police officers shot dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos from protest sites allegedly shot at the end of last year or early this year show that security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands on the wall.
The United Nations Higher Human Rights Officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from collapse, and it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project at the International Crisis Research Group.
Ethiopia is the second most densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably — there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia has barely been an example of democracy – human rights organizations are constantly referring to government repressions – the opposition in the country has been intercepted by the fact that dissidents have actually been forced to silence.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, murdered or exiled into remote deserts.
But it can change.
“If people are constantly suppressed and left with no choice but to protest, the uprising will rise,” said Seium Teshome, a lecturer at the university in central Ethiopia.
All the young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, starting with land use, ending with the government coalition’s takeover of power.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the government party and its allies have completely suppressed the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are growing; the struggle for this indeterminate, controversial border killed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to use tensions and rearrange themselves.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, boiling in the depths of the soul for several years, explode now.
The first one seems to be completely harmless: smartphones.
In the last couple of years only a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace, and the internet service has become better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often happens, especially during protests, many people still find an opportunity to communicate through the proxy servers they hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was how they organized the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhar, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Throughout the centuries, Amhara from Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian high mountain regions flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in low-lying areas.
But it's also changing.
"We will act together at the same time," said Mulata Gemechu, the leader of Oromo.
The biggest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo districts.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of the disturbance is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could predict danger.
Analysts claim that he particularly skillfully recognized the first signals of dissatisfaction and used scouts to obtain data and harm opponents.
“The current regime lacks common sense,” said Abdi, an analyst for conflict situations.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalen, appeared from nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was native to the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not trust the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that as a result, it will lead to even more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such upheavals was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said was an election that the government had stalled and then falsified.
During the subsequent repressions, many protesters were killed, although in smaller numbers than in recent months, and this period of riots went relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed appreciation to Ethiopia’s leaders for the forward-looking development of infrastructure, such as the new intercity train and significant progress in combating poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the growth of internal dissatisfaction by the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, the city of Amhar, attacked Tigray-owned enterprises, and anti-Tiger hate on social media is becoming widespread.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an uncomfortable position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently announced that it has closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in the already unstable region.
"And it will be difficult to pass through this stretched duct," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to override the last conflict that engulfed his election headquarters on Friday, claiming he was joking when he repeatedly said this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State group.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the presidential candidate from the Republican Party to reasonably address the American people.
It also put his deputies, who were trying to protect him during the period of turmoil, in an uncomfortable position as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Speaking this assumption at a congress on Wednesday evening, Trump resolutely insisted on his statement on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIL.
But in a Twitter post early on Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just a scam.
This post was the direct opposite of a statement made just a day earlier, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his allegations.
When radio-leading conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his speech by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the presidential candidate from the Republican Party did not take advantage of the opportunity.
The last scandal shattered when Trump tried to reorient his campaign on the economy against the backdrop of a decline in ratings.
Trump and Clinton made a competing talk about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump attempted to return to the subject.
Once again, on Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s plans would lead to tax increases, and said he thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as a justification before.
At the end of July, after he received widespread criticism, practically expressing the idea that the Russians should hack into Clinton’s email, he later explained his remarks, saying, “Of course I’m joking.”
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing some of the messages that are responding among his fans, seeing how they act, and then 'explaining' them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who analyzed the language.
But I also think he's cautious in his statements and knows that they're clever enough to treat them differently.
Instead of softening the speeches for the broad electorate, Trump has taken an even more vulnerable tone in recent days, as his rating continues to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published Friday, showed that Trump is resigning to Clinton with a large overweight in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and is going with her level in Florida.
While Trump usually tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has become the subject of increased attention in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in a position of discomfort: they have to publicly support him no matter how provocative his statements are.
Rudolph W. Juliani, the former mayor of New York, who is one of Trump’s most famous deputies, has made serious efforts to protect the candidate in an interview given by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is an acceptable political comment," Juliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that, before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown small organization, he called it a non-threatening, absolutely unfair, and that’s why it all happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq.
Most middle-ranking Republicans believe that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, has allowed ISIS to develop as it has not been able to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for discouraging each of his words and bias towards him.
He joked about the “poor unhappy” TV experts trying to figure it out, and said, “They’re weak!”
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump’s excuses as further evidence that he is not fit for presidents.
Once upon a time, a squeezed coffee shop returns to Greenpoint.
The Verb coffee shop was overcrowded, accepting only cash in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was expelled from her room with a showcase on Bedford Avenue.
Soup Sherry, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cookies.
The locals lamented it as the last loss in the renovating city.
Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can’t believe the CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But while New York is constantly changing, it, in turn, is being updated.
The reborn Verb coffee shop opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Besides, the coffee is still good.
The new "Verba" is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and general manager in the new location.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the very end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new location, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, has left a lot in his former form.
"Verb" works with the same beige distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even contains chandeliers from the old "Verba".
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu features sandwiches with bacon, eggs and cheese, and there are toppings made of capers or onions.
There are dishes made of borogo rice.
Coffee no longer serves beer, but now freshly squeezed juices are cooked.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he had paid attention to the constant flow of old permanent clients.
“Many of our former clients have also been pushed by prices from Williamsberg,” he said.
On one of the recent Sundays, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Olivier, 34, previously lived in Williamsberg and often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After the Verba closed, she said she had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that impelled me in Verbe,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although on that day instead of a regular ice-cream, she ordered cupcake tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been a loyal visitor to Verb since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same thing all the time.
“At fifteen minutes of the eighteenth, every day, like hours, I came, and my baseball was cooked for me with oil and all the fillings,” he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes an ordinary order, but one day he changes something with the help of bacon, eggs or cheese on the baseball with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said he was not offended that the soap shop had once taken over the old place.
In addition, Soup Sherry owners suggested to make a special soap for Verba, using coffee from a cold-cooked coffee as an ingredient.
“I think we might agree with their proposal,” Rodriguez said.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved this coffeehouse.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the showcase so that his new neighbors would feel desirable.
The new place has other advantages.
The local point for selling juices plans to pour on bottles and sell cold-cooked coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will join a neighboring building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client and shared that he was murdered bitterly when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that by entering and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
“How long have I wanted to feel that smell,” he admitted.
Depressive food depression in the "Flee Dining"
In March 1933, shortly after taking office as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fashionable Fifth Avenue dishes, such as fua-ga and Maryland squirrel soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: roasted eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and dessert - pudding from blackberry.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband, Andrew Cow, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
Wifes living in Brooklyn Heights are experts in the history of food.
Koua's last book, "Ragu in Chinese", was devoted to Chinese cuisine in America, and Zigelman told the story of life in a shooting apartment in Lower East Side through food in her book "Home 97 on the Street Fruit Garden".
Their new collaborative work "Flee Dining", which will be published by Harper Publishing on Tuesday, is a story of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing to some extent their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, simple snack shop in the Flatiron neighborhood that has been operating since 1929, the year of the Stock Exchange collapse.
Zigelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and bread with pieces of olives, and Cow, 57, took a duck, potato purée and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered meat roulette, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for discussion about food in the age of Depression.
“Roulettes were in high demand,” Zigelman said.
There was peanut roulette, liver roulette, bean roulette.
They were made from the main ingredient and inexpensive products that allowed the ingredient to stretch.
Imagine you’ve eaten as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Cow wrinkled.
“Maybe he was lying in the stomach with a stone,” he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women were preparing for farm workers, and freshly cooked cake was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during the First World War. The "Flee Dining" describes how the country managed to suddenly stop being a country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans,” Cow said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was as difficult as it was: mysterious dishes, such as roulette and roast cakes, became the main food; roast cake is "a great way to eliminate food", — Zigelman noted, - because the cooks could hide unpleasant dishes.
Fresh fruits have been replaced with cheaper dry fruits.
Meat, which has been the basis of American food for many years, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value became more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While researching for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that era: a baked onion, peeled with peanut butter.
“This addition to the dining table was not a success,” Cow said.
Ziegler added: “It was very strange.”
Arachnid oil is not suitable for baked onions.
This was typical of many homemade recipes.
As never before and never since, household specialists — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Bureau from 1923 to 1943 — governed the country’s food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budget composers", to take on the challenge and turn a burgeon like fried spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
"Flee Dining" is a glimpse of curious historical facts.
Particularly spicy stories about the government’s reaction to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s position in the spirit of “letting cookies eat.”
Publicly transported by the Iowa state's simple farming cliff of his childhood, he ate like a refined millionaire he became.
“He liked continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce,” Koo said.
He ate almost in a gold-plated dining room, wearing a smoking suit.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
As told in the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economist who was absolutely uninterested in taste, and this led to the White House "consuming not only the most delicate food in Washington, D.C., but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked."
Many of the culinary remedies of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got up again.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Siegelman, and on how science has been used in cooking.
Wifes say that when they wrote the book, they better understood the food habits of the mother of Siegelman — that she could not throw away food, for example.
“She was seriously afraid of a careless attitude toward food,” Cow said.
Zigelman recalls: “She seriously poisoned people.”
There was an unpleasant case of prophylaxis.
When the plates at Eisenberg's desert, they and Cow got a dessert that they prepared at home: a dessert made from blackberry that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called blackberry mushrooms," Zigelman said, adding that it was a common reception - to give modest recipes throw names.
There were no crushed creams, only blackberry, a little flour, sugar, water and cover.
Everyone unwillingly plunged the spoon into a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Cow asked for supplements twice.
With the voice of the budget maker, he said to his wife: "A few rubled Greek nuts wouldn't have bothered here."
Arrest of figures in the case of mass fighting at Hovan Cemetery extended until November 14
Until November 14, the Presnen court left the figurines in the case of a mass fighting at the Hovan Cemetery, satisfying the request for investigation.
There are 14 defendants in the case.
It is recalled that on May 14, at the Hovan Cemetery, a mass fighting of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with the use of weapons killed three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuriy Chabuyev, and the lawyer, co-founder of the public organization Zdonova Nazna, Alexander Bocharnikov, were charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second 2016 pension index could be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on August 12 by the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have set specific parameters on how much pension needs to be raised in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
The economists are now summarizing the results of the six-month period, and we will complete this work in the next two to three weeks,” Holodets quoted Interfax as saying.
Commenting on the proposed six-month-old pension scheme proposed by Alexei Kudrin, Head of the Centre for Strategic Developments, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the issue was not being considered in the Cabinet.
At the end of July it became known that the Government agreed a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan went to the final of the competition for shooting from a small caliber rifle.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan went to the finals of the competition for shooting from a low-caliber rifle from the position of the couch at the Olympics in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and took first place - this is a new Olympic record in qualification.
Kirill Grigoryan became second - 628.9.
In total, eight of the best athletes came to the final.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gülen has called for an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup in Turkey.
“I demand that an independent international commission conduct an investigation into an attempted coup d’état,” the French newspaper Le Monde quoted Gülen as saying.
The Turkish opposition also said that “if at least some of the allegations are confirmed, I will return to Turkey.”
Gülen, however, denies any involvement in the coup d'état, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
Istanbul’s court has previously arrested opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen.
The military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of July 15-16.
Gilead Companies Refund Law Firms Costs During Hepatitis C Patent Dispute With Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of the costs of lawyer services it has incurred in connection with the hepatitis C patent issue with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc., the federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was exempted from payment of <0x24>200 million in damages for infringement of Merck's two patents relating to Gilead's pharmaceuticals, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a US judge found a number of infringements by the company.
On Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead had the right to reimburse the costs incurred during the dispute.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to a laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead’s medicines.
Armed forces created with U.S. support claim to have taken full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
The armed forces, created with U.S. support, took full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining ISIS militants left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now clearing the city after the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city left.
They liberated more than 2,000 civilian hostages who were detained by militants, Sharfan Darvish of the Allied SDS Military Council of Manbij told Reuters.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we are undergoing cleaning operations,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned <0x24>10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had <0x24>10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received <0x24>1 million in charitable contributions, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about <0x24>5.3 million in performance fees, and the former Secretary of State Deacon Deaton paid <0x24>3 million.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, together with his wife Anna Holton, has released tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard of financial transparency," Clinton's senior general advisor Jennifer Palmery said in a statement.
Unlike them, Donald Trump hides behind fake excuses and violates his past promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the audit of the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
"Your move," Clinton's pre-election staff adviser Jan Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic Party candidate's declaration.
On Thursday, Trump's special advisor Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the checks have been completed.
Trump’s critics, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues in 2012, said his rejection raises questions about his status, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including Rossi.
Clinton got caught up on the issue and released an online video on Friday, in which the top spot was given to prominent Republicans, who convinced Trump to publish a tax report.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades without exception: to publish his tax returns,” she said.
The newspaper Politico reported that Trump had not paid any or almost any taxes in the two years of the 1990s, and a business analyst for the New York Times cited many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who believe that the cases may still be so.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of controversy in the presidential election.
Clinton endorsed the rule, named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, that would ensure that people receiving more than <0x24>1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, offered Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under IRS control, and that Trump was "afraid" not the tax collecting agency, but the voters.
Clinton’s pre-election headquarters published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective total tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only <0x24>100 of their income was the source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index payment fund, and the Clintons reported dividends and capital gains of <0x24>109,000.

Condoms with Chili Powder and Fireworks Increase Protection of Tanzanian Elephants
Environmental fighters in Tanzania use an unconventional way to prevent elephants from entering settlements – they throw in condoms filled with chili powder.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came to mind this idea a few years ago, together with the U.S. Nature Conservation Committee, took on its promotion, training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to protect their non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent cause.
In the past, many people used guns to protect themselves.
On Friday, World Elephant Day is dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we invented the toolkit ..., we’ve seen a change in attitude within these communities, resulting in them much more confident that they will not be able to let elephants into their fields without harming the elephants,” said the executive director of Hoguide.
The first two steps are to light a torch in front of an elephant that has violated the border and to transmit signals using a horn.
If you can’t frighten him, they throw the so-called “chili cloud.”
The chili powder, mixed with the soil, is placed with the clay in a condom, and its end is twisted, outside only phytil remains.
When igniting the condoms explode with a thunderbolt, spraying a small powder of chili powder in the air.
One dome is usually enough to deploy an elephant to the other side.
The extreme measure is a launch device that fires Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Twenty-two Turkish diplomats have yet to return to Turkey after a coup attempt in July.
Such data was brought by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Chavushoglu in an interview with local journalists.
In the first phase, we recalled 208 staff diplomats to continue their work at the center.
Of these, 32 people have not returned without objective reasons and explanations,” the head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
In July, there was an attempted coup d’état in Turkey.
The country’s authorities have officially declared that the coup d’état has failed, and have also reported the detention of more than 6,000 people, including military personnel of the upper and middle class.
As a result of the coup attempt, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry, 290 people were killed.
The Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's phone code at the "demand" of the Arabs - RT News
The French director of Jewish origin unleashed a scandal in the media, finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have Israel’s phone code on the list, with officials referring to “demands” from Arab customers.
Claude Lantzman, author of the documentary about the Holocaust “Shoa”, expressed his discontent with the Kempinski Bristol hotels in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lantman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided to the hotel.
The country, however, has not been mentioned among the states that can be called directly from the room.
How could it have happened that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of New Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Written by Lancman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to pick up Israel through its own telephone service center.
In seeking an explanation, the director raised this question on the stand of the hotel administration.
The answer he received there, according to Lantman, was “shocking him.”
The hotel's clerk said the measure was "a deliberate decision to manage the Kempinski hotel network."
The reason behind this move has sparked even more anger from the director.
“Most of our Arab guests, and they demanded that Israel’s code be removed,” said Lantman, a staff member of the hotel.
Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case “a terrible shame,” according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
This is, in fact, a terrible shame.
What happened in Germany, and in this network of hotels, is even more embarrassing.
We don't need explanations here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,” the official said.
The case caused a lot of resonance on the internet; people called it a scandal.
Some have claimed that the Kempinski hotel simply “has come to terms” with the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"They would be ashamed," another post said, stating that the hotel, located on the glorious Kurfurstendamm street, is next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself hurried to dismiss any charges, calling the incident an "inspection" and "excusing" before Lantman, reports the newspaper Der Spiegel.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel on the list of fast-track,” a spokesman for the hotel Kempinski quoted the Suddeutsche Zeitung as saying.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest government reforms of the state education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riots began when police tried to disperse students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposal of Governor Generaldo Alckmin, nearly 100 state high schools will be closed, and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some of the protesters could be seen writing graffiti on the walls directed against interim President Michael Temer.
The latest protest came just a few days after protesters mass out on the streets to support the deposed President Dilma Rousseff, when the country’s Senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, according to RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Jagarian.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is a growing interest of Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are resuming ties with Iran, and new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Jagarian said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to <0x24>856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to <0x24>697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent, to <0x24>158 million.
Increased trade was achieved thanks to the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists this year.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mainly for tourists, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran has entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It can be said with certainty that last year’s record for the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia will be beaten,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, which, he hopes, will change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition,” he said.
The state continues to rotate the nuts in the defense-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the "systematic failure" of the orders of the director-general of the Almaz-Antey Group, the "missing of work" and the "loss of trust".
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed head of NGOs for the next three years.
Information about Neskorodov’s dismissal appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause widespread resonance in the media.
How to explain such silence in the context of the large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This further confirms that the Defence Industrial Complex (Defence Industrial Complex) has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from the public.
The removal of Neskorodova is undoubtedly an important event from the point of view of order in the industry.
NGO "Almaz" is the main company of the group, which specializes in the production of anti-missile complexes (MRT) of marine and ground-based.
Almaz is currently working on the creation of the Polyment-Redout and Morpheus Cluster, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is caused by a breakdown of deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007, and the commissioning was expected in 2013.
"Polyment-Redut" should be the main air defense system on the latest Navy ships.
According to the information I receive, in a few years of testing, none of the tests were actually successful.
It is true, as far as I can judge, that there is no unambiguous fault with Almaz,” Kornev said.
The expert fears that the delay in commissioning may also occur with the S-500.
The experimental construction work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes are expected to enter the force.
The Ministry of Defence assures that "work is being carried out planned and everything will be completed within the deadlines set", although in 2014 the department recognized the existence of problems with the development of the C-500.
It is extremely difficult to give an assessment of the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has led "Almaz" since 2011.
Kornev noted that deadlines for projects could be both a reason and a reason for dismissal.
In his view, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about the internal processes in the OPK and the plans for management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders of tens of billions of rubles, and big money, as is known, loves silence.
As a rule, directors of defense companies leave their positions at their own discretion, under the agreement of the parties or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the removal took place publicly, although there was no resonance.
This implies the idea that the Almaz leader was perhaps a stropty figure and resisted the descending "disorders" from above.
It seems that the state no longer intends to compromise on such behavior.
By the hands of the shareholders, it will eliminate those who prefer to argue with the installations of the Ministry of Defence and do not perform the tasks assigned.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the hacked administrators (manipulation at the shipyard "Star").
Increased attention is paid to the problems of the sector by the President.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industry Commission and regularly holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of the OPEC managers, seeking to have a loyal board of directors at hand, which will execute the orders received from above.
This is far from an ideal policy, but against the background of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the OPC, the state does not have other instruments.
The situation in the defence is of course not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation is stimulating the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
Parallel to the "cleaning" of the administrators in the OPK, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The army’s personnel acquired a new quality with the arrival of Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president has adopted the famous saying, “You want peace, prepare for war.”
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union’s military power and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which consolidated Moscow’s sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
Evidence of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and a relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The celebration of the "winners" in the Cold War eventually turned into the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in a “civilized world,” there may not be a single quiet corner left.
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such circumstances, the only allies of our country remain the fleet and the army.
Strengthening military power will allow Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and come to the new frontiers of world politics.
Scotsman Callum Skinner crawls to the finish line, as a result of which the British capture the bike gold
Scotsman Callum Skinner sprinted for a men's team sprint on a bike drum in Rio last night, as a result of which the UK team trio defended its 2012 London title.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native played the strongest role his friend, Scottish Sir Chris Hoe, made his own, and the young man proudly entered history, jumping on the final straight to win the New Zealand favourite team.
Britain claimed the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoe claimed the right to a fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Track Cycling Championships in London, despite the fact that Hoe has since ended his career.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of expert participant Jamie Staff.
They did this at the time when the Hindus appeared.
Hoi's departure also created a void that Kian Emmadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man held by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotland, which was now realized.
Hindes, Kenny — champions with Hoe four years ago — and Skinner set an Olympic qualifying record, but New Zealand surpassed the rules in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold duel.
Hindes was right behind after his round, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hindes drove on a larger transmission to slow down and allow Kenny, and especially Skinner, to keep pace.
Howe watched from his seat as an invited BBC expert and caught the sight of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a staircase comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set the Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After triumphing in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Howe, Hindes admitted intentionally falling on track after a failed start.
He later declined to comment, and there was no way to appeal from competitors in the UK.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the stands."
We've all been together as a team for the last three months.
We have lost so many races with a world name that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for the country, which has won seven out of 10 title races in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the rider is waiting for another five successful days.
With the form shown by Kenny, it's not beyond the possibility to imagine how he repeats Hoi's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in one Games.
This would allow you to see how Kenny — who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoja, who was also born on March 23 (this seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister — proves his own.
It would be like Josh.
The next time Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I’m just enjoying it right now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your comrades.
It’s a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he has to get knighthood."
It was the only one in the day to win medals, but there was a follow-up good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Dull qualify for the fastest four-kilometre team race.
They finished by 3:51,943.
The world record set for winning gold in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where the Wiggins will definitely be the focus.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of a qualifying trip, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Roosevelt Shand, Eleanor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngawa have improved the world record by showing a time of 4:13,260.
The UK team has come to the conclusion that it relies on a powerful team of cyclists to take ownership of the mid-term Olympics and earn a lot of medals.
After in fact exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not the last — the resignation from the position of technical director Shane Satton in April due to charges of sexism and harassment, and the resignation of major figures such as Hoi and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first evening race on the cycling trail, it seems that the legendary now glory of Britain in reaching the peaks at the right time may just be repeated again.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant under threat due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminum plant in Victoria – as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers – is under threat because the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the owners of the plant, will be going to terminate the supply contract: everything is planned,
This is a consequence of the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian government not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be threatened at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, may be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect consequences, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed a metallurgical plant in Point Henry, leading to the closure of a power plant in England last year.
The Portland metallurgical plant of Alcoa is losing money and at risk of closure.
These actions were the result of reflections on the future of the plant, which has been going on for several years, initially due to strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later due to the price of the plant’s products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminum plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Wally, said it expects the other three owners will also take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling share of the plant is owned by the joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects that the Portland facility will continue to operate, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, the above-mentioned contracts are the so-called ‘held contracts’, which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period of termination, so they actually end in 2017.
“Accordingly, AGL still expects that these contracts will bring their share of revenue in the 2017 financial year,” the electricity company said.
Any potential impact on AGL’s profits from the 2018 financial year is currently limited by forecasts of a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its account by <0x24>187 million in terms of an “imminent dissolution.”
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate a metallurgical plant or provide electricity to a metallurgical plant.”
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it still has to explain why it broke the contract.
Analysts feared a possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavorable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL chief operating officer Steven Mickelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
For us as a producer, it will be bad,” he said.
Not only the reality show star Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September Vogue number
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan mother-manager Chris, appeared on a September-led cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the brand Estee Lauder and has deflected at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Being in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the "Kardashyan Family?"), prepared reality-video, in which the whole Kardashyan-Jenner family (Rob and Kaitlyn's deboshyars, also joined by the klassor, the common favorite uncle-Kardashyan.
It's a standard storyline for almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to their birthday (Sicroft utters the phrase, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the other show at 8 a.m.), but Chris needed to make this or so.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered the new era of Kardashian.
Let older sister Kendall Kim get on the Vogue cover earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Canyon West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September edition is the best-selling Vogue edition of the year.
Thickly similar to a gift edition rather than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the Fashionista portal, 615 pages of last year’s 832-page edition contained advertisements).
The news about which of the stars will hit his cover is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years photos of the magazine have merged to the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more “celebrations that work as models” than “models that are celebrities.”
The Oscar winner and the face of the Dior brand Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after the honor came out of Lady Gaga.
But even in the unlikely case, if Jenner, which the magazine described as the “outstanding model” of her generation, falls into the first category, she’s in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality shows stars, or modern kids who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
They are truly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover last year, this year was one of the most successful in his career in connection with the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
Jenner’s position in the fashion world, given her past star of a reality television show, should always have been funny.
In June, one of the first Victoria's Secret models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "the lessons of the moment."
These moods were again confused after news of Jenner’s appearance on the Vogue cover.
But it makes no sense to cling to displeasure.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you a tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own apps, available on a paid subscription.
She sells her own handmade photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in a reality show on television.
Public law centers refuse to provide services to 160,000 people per year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the least-protected people refuse to serve in public law centres, as the sector is preparing for an effect that will further cut funding on and so far within the scope of its activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who are unable to fight unfair deprivation of property and so on – have already been denied legal assistance and representatives.
Public legal services, already operating outside the scope of the possibility, are preparing for further reductions.
As of June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
The director of the Queensland Public Law Centers, James Farrell, said that according to a recent census report by the National Association of Public Law Centers, thousands of people are resigning each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government’s decision is not cancelled, the situation will only get worse.
“The Queensland Public Law Centers are constantly getting insufficient funding: this means thousands of people are getting the denial of the vital services they need,” he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families going through divorce, unjustly fired workers — all these people have problems of a legal nature, and this report shows that they can’t get help in need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of less-protected residents of Queensland will be forced to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Queensland Justice Minister and Senator George Brandis to immediately cancel these cuts in funding so that people can get the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise the financing of free legal aid to the country's average.
Now it is time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centers and communities, their clients, and the government of Pala<0xC5><0xA1>tchuk it is time to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s pre-election headquarters was sued after an employee allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump’s election headquarters was sued: it is alleged that the headquarters did nothing after the report that his North Carolina chief of operations threatened an employee with a pistol while they were driving a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state election headquarters.
Bordini said he had waited several months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized that “it won’t happen.”
Director Earl Phillip "takes the gun, puts his right pointer on the wrist, and pointes his ass to Vincent's knee cup," Bordini said in a complaint.
Complaining to the local and regional administration of the pre-election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people were involved in similar incidents with Phillip, the statement said.
“The guns don’t have to be shot to do damage,” Bordini said in a complaint.
The lawsuit took place just two days after the presidential candidate from the Republican Party produced a furore, telling the listeners in North Carolina that "people of the Second Amendment" - understood as the owners of the arms and its lovers - could begin to act from the syllabus and if his peer-to-peer.
Trump’s pre-election headquarters said the media pulled his words out of context and that he did not speak out in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demanded compensation from the election staff for negligent control, and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, insulting actions and causing moral harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks slowed down in response to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were not successful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, said Philip had recently left the election headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called back.
Presidential candidate from the Republican Party, Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Division of the Supreme Court of Mecklenburg County, Charlotte.
The United Kingdom should move the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring revival and prosperity not only in our local settlements and throughout London, but also throughout the country.
In my opinion, that was exactly the huge advantage to Heathrow, just as it was with London in 2012, where we made every effort to get our nationalities and regions to benefit from the Games.
The Olympics have brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do it again, creating opportunities for locals and firms next to Heathrow.
For our local settlements alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As it was before London in 2012, there will be those who think the task of expanding Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be in a difficult position on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be shown wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a wonderful team in Heathrow, which has implemented a program of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment in time and within the budget, from the T5 – the best terminal of the airport for five consecutive years, to the T2, built in the middle of the two most busy months.
They are now ready to provide a third take-off and landing track, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a huge success for the UK, and I’m sure the expansion of Heathrow will also be.
It is time for us to move the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow, providing our future of trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton - Chairman of the Council of Heathrow and former Treasury Trade Attachment
Adblock Plus, Facebook Playing "Cats-Maus" on Ad Blocking
For companies that make money on internet advertising, attempts to bypass ad blocking software are a game of “cat-mouse”, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, literally a couple of days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post that users can update their filters in the program to block ad blockers.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site was swapping around its ads to make it harder for advertisers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now states that it was able to bypass the new code.
In his blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open-source ad blockers community and those who are trying to circumvent it, the time has come since the invention of the ad blocking," and that Facebook may have made its own decision.
The fact that the world’s largest social network has entered the fight is a clear sign of how big the problem has become the ad blockers for the industry.
Around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, according to last year’s Pagefair and Adobe survey; almost four times the number of people who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is hunting for desktop ad blockers, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook’s mobile apps for social networks and Instagram, according to the spokesperson.
But still, advertising in the desktop version is a profitable enough article to make Facebook consider such a step a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it will update its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted.
Facebook said on Thursday that the new Adblock filters are worrying as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
“This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesman said in an email.
Ad blockers are a rough tool, so instead we focused on creating tools like Advertising Preferences to hand over control to people.
Woman Moved On A Swiss Highway In An Obvious Suicide Episode
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after the woman was moved several vehicles on the highway early in the morning on Thursday in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident took place at A1 near Morge in the canton of Vo right after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several involved drivers have already been questioned, but the identity of some has not yet been established, the police said, calling on them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case has been initiated, a "logical" step in such a situation, said lawyer Gile Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be determined whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
This is what the prosecutor must determine,” Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both of which involve a man walking in the dark on the highway — it was sentenced that drivers cannot expect an accidental meeting with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, the officer was excused from causing death by negligence after she struck and killed a man lying on A1 near Payern on the night of August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, hearing a trial.
The court found that the woman police officer — who responded to the emergency call — was driving the vehicle in a manner that was justified, and that the presence of a man on the road was “absolutely exceptional and unpredictable,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the incident on Thursday near Morzh should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA’s Climate Model: Venus Was Once Inhabited
Venus may have been once inhabited, according to NASA’s new climate model estimates.
Scientists from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at Nassau have developed a model for studying the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, with its hot anhydrous surface and an atmosphere saturated with carbon dioxide, could ever exist conditions similar to Earth’s.
Scientists have previously assumed that the slight speed of Venus’ rotation is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a distilled atmosphere similar to Earth’s, and still rotate slowly.
The model also considered the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more drought regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographic variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Earlier Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent darker.
“According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus puts the sun’s day-side almost two months at a time,” said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio.
It warms the surface of the planet and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds acting as an umbrella protecting the surface of the planet from an essential part of solar heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which, surprisingly, are a few degrees colder than they are today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously assumed by scientists in the study of planets.
Although Venus may have once been inhabited, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and its water vapor was extinguished by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen flew off, only a dense carbon dioxide atmosphere with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy Resigns as Avalanche Team Coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
Executive Vice President/Chef of the Colorado team Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the past three years, I have been serving as the head coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
Throughout the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities must perfectly coincide with the vision of the organization.
He must also have the right to vote when making decisions that affect the team’s work.
These conditions are not met at the moment.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick told me about his decision today,” Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy became the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a Central Division win, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs for the past two years.
The Avalanche team announced a score of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and was five points behind the Wild team in the fight for the second favourable trip to the Western Conference.
A goalkeeper from the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups – two against the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oilmen resume negotiations and suspend strikes <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Workers’ strikes on oil workers’ wages in the North Sea have been suspended, and all sides of the discussion are starting a new round of talks, the leading representatives of the parties said.
Strikes against the oil service company Wood Group were sporadicly organised on the platforms in the North Sea, under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
“The Wood Group and the unions Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes,” the joint statement said.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of next week, to look at the issues in a fresh perspective.
The unions reported that their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, was aimed at potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract employees operating in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market tensions.
The company’s rate cuts occurred after a 10 percent reduction in rates for contract employees working on the coast in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the space needed to overcome the market decline.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas operations in countries up to 10 as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-fusion with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the falling prices of crude oil: the economic situation has deteriorated due to the decision to leave the European Union adopted by the UK in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that would work for the majority, not just for some,” he said in a statement.
Less than <0x24>1.4 billion in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared to an average of about <0x24>7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of the stars in the Pleiades accumulation
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalog of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades accumulation.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how periods of rotation are related to the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the star’s mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” she said in a statement to the press.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They rotate as fast as they will never again.
At their peak speeds of rotation, these growing stars throw out large amounts of star wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds are acting inhibitory on the stars.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation starts to slow.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as solar spots.
The latest catalogue of rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Riball compares stars to dancers: larger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
“In the Pleiad ballet, we see that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster are usually referred to very light stars,” Riball said.
Since the Pleiades accumulation is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars with the speeds of rotation.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of star rotation, both younger and older," Riball said.
We want to know a lot more about how, where and why the stars slow down their rotation and hang their "dance shoes" on the nail, in a nutshell.
Riball and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades rotational speeds in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation, related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian diversants detained in Crimea, is conducted by two departments, says Kommersant.
The FSB collects evidence of the participation of detainees in the preparation of diversions in Crimea.
As previously reported, grateful testimony was given by the resident of the Ukrainian city Energodar Evgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the result.
According to him, as objects for diversions, he considered the chemical plant "Titan" in Armeniansk, the oil base in Teodosia, Kerch ferry, gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airports.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all diversant subordinates were able to detain.
This, in particular, was the reason for the arrest of the suspects in the Kiev district of Simferopol, the publication notes.
The main coach of the Russian soccer team was Stanislav Cherchesov
At the meeting of the executive of the Russian Football Union, a decision was made on the appointment of the head coach of the Russian football team Stanislav Cherchev.
The contract with him will be calculated for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the executive of the Russian Federation appointed the head coach of the Russian soccer team Stanislav Cherchesov.
He is a well-known footballer who previously played in Moscow "Spartak" in the position of goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was a mentor of such Russian teams as all the same "Spartak", "Zemchuzhina-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dynamo".
It is reported that the contract with Churchesov will be signed in the nearest future and is scheduled for two years.
Thus, it is his duty to prepare the team for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that his coaching headquarters will be Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikovi.
There is information that the entire coaching staff’s salary will be 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the media, the leadership of the Russian Federation set before Stanislav Churchesov the goal of bringing Russia’s team to the semi-finals and winning medals.
As the coach himself said, as a priority task he considers creating a competitive environment in the team and is going to give the players the opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Churchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Churchesov will be held on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly match with the Turkish team.
Earlier, the post of head coach of the Russian football team was held by Leonid Slutsky, who combined him with coaching at the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after the failed performance of the Russian national team at the Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad result of the team itself.
Compressing between Angola and South Africa, Namibia was severely hurt during a long struggle against apartheid.
However, since gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, this country with a population of 2.4 million has achieved tremendous success, especially in recent years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the Government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries see free elementary and secondary education as self-contained, in many poor countries in middle and even primary schools they require fees for education.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce a tuition fee for "refunding costs".
In Namibia, however, primary school education is free of charge.
Since 2015, high school has also been free of charge.
The country’s authorities are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases of the disease by 97% in the last ten years.
Contrary to the international trend of rising inequality, it is decreasing in Namibia.
Compared to the 1993 figure, the Gini ratio, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
Poverty fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than <0x24>1.90 a day) also decreased from almost 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest rating for freedom of speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country is far ahead of the United States and other wealthy states.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Corruption Perception Index", which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia has managed to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional assessment methods, remains quite high – almost 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high incidence of HIV/AIDS - almost 17% of the population is infected.
According to World Bank estimates, Namibia is among the countries with above-average income, but the authorities insist that their state is actually a developing country.
Namibia, of course, is facing some difficulties that are inherent in poorly developed economies.
The state has to develop a very large and droughty country with a small population.
In the country’s territory in the deserts live isolated hunter-gatherer tribes, which must somehow be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
Integration of people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
This is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it is facing the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia did not intend to lower its hands, and the country is solving the problems that are before it.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities were engaged in the creation of a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that the competing political factions gathered together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical services not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbors.
Approximately 15-20% of visitors to medical institutions in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that the neighbors were not chosen, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share the shortage of water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Government of Namibia has rightly held that rich natural resources can easily become a curse by contributing to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that revenues from Namibia’s natural resources need to be invested in infrastructure and production capacities.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek the maximum profit from the sale of the country’s resources, and revise investment laws and mining contracts to make sure it is.
Transparency is decisive for this process, so strong support by the Government for freedom of speech is so important.
As the head of state Hague Gaingob noted, the media often says that he doesn’t like it.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has received, the president says.
Not all of Namibia’s key resources are exhaustive.
Some, such as fishing, are renewable, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that start with serious shortcomings — racism, colonialism, inequality and low levels of development — can pave the way for common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the "Gold of Varna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps this was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, at the excavations of the Varna Necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artefacts - more than three thousand total weight of 6 kilograms was found.
Only one tomb, known as the "Cave No. 43", was extracted 990 gold objects weighing more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold could soon shift to the invisible-looking bush found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Youth.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tell Junacci is located far from the sea, near the village of Junacci in the Pazardzhik district.
A bush is a gold strip that is twisted into a ring.
Javor Boyadzhiev, the chief of the excavation at Tella Junace, dated to 4600 BC and claimed that it was older than Varna gold by at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date around the same period, 4600 - 4200 BC.
Technologies that allow metal to be dated with impeccable precision do not currently exist.
How do you know which gold is more ancient than gold?
Obviously, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: “I’m absolutely sure that the gold of the Younger is older than the gold of Varna.”
This is an extremely important finding: it looks like a small object, but it is large enough to occupy a place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadjiev said that scientists will soon analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine and study the archaeological layer where the gold artefact was found.
This will help to date the bush with as much accuracy as possible.
The place of discovery also explains a lot.
Tell Junacci is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Today, Tel Aviv is considered to be the oldest "city" in Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Over the following centuries, metalworking has evolved rapidly in the region, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the national historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: the Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC around metalworking centers began to emerge settlements of the urban type.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Telly Junacci is perhaps the oldest, since artifacts dating back to 4900 BC were found here.
I would call Tell Junace the prototype of the modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This place is older than Sumer for a thousand years,” says Boyadzhiev, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia – modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the usual sense of the word.
The excavations of Telly the Young have been underway since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall, which once reached three meters in height, were found.
There is little left of houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, urban density, "business center" and residential outskirts.
Tell Junaci is often called the "Bird City": dozens of clay figures of birds have been found here.
All birds are depicted in a state of peace, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local cult.
The "Bird City" was destroyed around 4100 B.C. - possibly by the Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
The Cossacks did not have cities, but they had horses and weapons.
The three-foot fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have discovered obvious signs of violent fighting: inside the houses were found remains of old men, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by combat gangs.
New findings and new facts appear every year, changing the usual conceptions of the ancient history of humanity.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the “lost” first civilization of Europe that was born in the Balkans.
A powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization was the "Gold of Varna", found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that the gold luxury of Varna should have preceded something—something like a tiny gold mill created in Tel Aviv.
The Porsche 911 Targa is artificially outdated
It is officially stated that the training of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists of the unit who work with serial machines.
The “Retro-Arc” is, for example, in the special color of the Etna Blue body, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - in this color even the logo of the model is decorated.
In addition, the Targa received a branded white chart along the edges and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel drives, as well as some body design details, decorated in a "white-gold metallic".
In the interior, the retro dots are noticeably smaller: it is largely distinguished by the gray-blue design gamma, new chairs with extended ranges of electro-regulation and separated black anodized steel thresholds with the unit logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive as a gift a case for the car and a richly dedicated album with photos of the production process.
The Porsche Exclusive specialists do not touch the power plant: the retro-targa in its characteristics perfectly matches the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder turbocharged engine with a turbocharged capacity of 3.0 l, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each specific sports car are reported.
Facebook and Advertising Blockers Unveiled ‘Arm Race’
The recent introduction of Facebook’s technology, which prevented advertising from being hidden on social media pages, provoked developers of solutions to block advertising from responding.
AdBlock Plus has released an antidote, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus has advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
Representatives of the social network noted that, trying to trick new technology into "unblockable" advertising, the AdBlock Plus solution along with commercial ads also blocks many regular posts from friends or pages.
Facebook expressed its regret over this AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
As a source among social media developers told TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on Facebook’s desktop site will be ready in the coming hours.
Thus, the social networks and blockers unveiled a sort of “weapons race”, trying to beat each other, the affected side became users who missed interesting records from friends or saw ads where they were not used to seeing it.
Ethical aspects of blocking advertising have been sparking hot controversy lately.

Dongfeng brings to Russia cross-country Fengguang 370 and pickup Rich New - site By www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 - a representative of China's car class gaining popularity, combining the merits of minivan and crossover.
Another announced Russian prime minister is the Rich New pickup.
Many Western firms decided to ignore the Moscow International Motor Show this year, so the void of the exhibition halls "Crocus Expo" will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has great views of the Russian market and intends to offer our car lovers a number of interesting news in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossover, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (about 550,000 rubles at the current rate).
For Russians such a value is unlikely to shine, and the question of deliveries to our country is still in the stage of discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 managed to reach the 11th place in the list of best-selling minivans, although due to its large road light (175 mm) and protective plastic suspension on the lower perimeter of its body can be quite numbered.
The crossover is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the Fengguang 360, the 370 has the same wheelbase at 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm vs. 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden planks, but shown in the photo a large vertical touch screen "like Tesla" on the central console was only on the early exhibition copies of the crossover, and the cars with "music" came on sale more simply.
Five of the seven seats are easily folded, forming a flat loading platform with a length of 1650 mm, the maximum volume of the trunk - 1500 l.
The engine for Fengguang 370 is provided with only one - 1.5-liter gasoline "atmosphere" of 115 hp, combined with a 5-speed mechanical gearbox.
On the dynamic qualities of the machine the manufacturer modestly silences, but promises the saving budget of the owner appetite at the level of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Pickup Rich New is well known to the Russians of the previous generation Nissan NP300 Navara, but with a little favored Chinese stylists design.
Despite its morally outdated design, this model still enjoys stable demand from Chinese consumers as a reliable and reluctant "working horse".
At a similar price, Rich New is probably interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become inexpensively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines of choice: petrol 2.4 l (137 hp) or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 hp).
Gearbox - only mechanics, drive - on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a rigidly connected "front".
There will be a Dongfeng stand and a new flagship sedan A9, its Russian prime minister's representation of the Chinese company announced in June.
Minnesota-like crossovers are growing in the Chinese market, one of the latest innovations - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng lineup consists of two models: the sedan S30 and the hatchback H30 Cross.
In the seven months of this year, Chinese dealers sold 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notifications will cease to be sent by mail - website By driving www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending property tax notifications.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to the unchanged scheme over the years: in summer and autumn they receive by mail receipts for the payment of the transport tax for the previous year.
This year, however, many will not be able to do so.
The fact is that the tax inspection without excessive noise has changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
For those who are registered in the "Personal Office of the Taxpayer" on the official website of the nalog.ru department, the notifications will come in electronic form.
In the inspection, they automatically counted such Russians as online users and removed them from the standard, "paper" mailing.
The news will touch all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All the others will still receive the usual letters.
However, the possibility of returning to the old scheme is also available to account holders on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write an application.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after the drafting, while the letter will go away for a few days and may be lost at all.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of tax inspection exceeded by 18 million people, which will allow the agency to seriously save on mail mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly insufficient to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some may have registered in the "personal office" to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notifications by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the resulting consequences.
Access to the "Personal Office of the Taxpayer" is done in three ways: through the account of the gosuslugi.ru portal, by means of an electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person in any tax inspection department (regardless of the place of registration).
We would like to remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid by December 1.
The transmission of notifications began in July.
The Mercedes-Benz G-Class tuning, in which the finishes are aimed at achieving very high performance, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the G-Power masters, who took over the modification of the sport version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its passion for BMW cars, but nothing human is alien to its masters.
Actually, why not upgrade the G 63-571-strong flying tank with the aerodynamics of the tank and launching up to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Squeezing the "muscles" of the crazy "helicopter", the masters took advantage of the advantages that the 5.5-litre super-inflatable "eight" opens up.
But the dynamics of the launch up to a hundred improved by indistinguishable 0.1 sec, and now the flying "chirp" is able to crack in 5.3 sec.
However, acceleration at average speeds is certainly given him noticeably better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 does not drive faster than 210 km/h, then the tuning all-roader with the deactivated electronic "collar" is capable of pushing out 250 km/h.
Outside the car is virtually inseparable from its factory primary source, with the exception of other wheel drives - 23-inch Hurricane RR size 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach luxury unit has announced a stunning 6 m long concept coupé, which will be presented at the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the “green subbrand” BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand.
At least four environmental novelties are expected to appear in the coming years.
