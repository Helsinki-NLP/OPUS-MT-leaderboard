Members of the Assembly of Wales fear 'passing through Marretas'
There is a consternation on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP (Deputies of the Welsh Parliament).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Galaxy Parliament".
Some members of this assembly, from all political backgrounds, fear that this will make them fall into ridicule.
An AM Labour said the group is concerned about the fact that "the designation rimar with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrements".
A Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MP said the group was "open-minded" about the name change, but noted that the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a pronunciation similar to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on how the Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave its assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, to which it noted general support for the proposal to designate the Assembly as "Galaxy Parliament".
On the issue of the title of the MPs, the Commission favoured "Deputies of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to bring consensus together may constitute a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other amendments regarding the way the assembly exercises its activities, such as rules on disqualification of AMs and the setting up of the commission system.
When they debate the legislation, the AMs will have the final word on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians to Refer to Change Country Name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which integrates a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbor to the north constitutes a complaint about its territory, having repeatedly raised objections to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is nothing more than the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Sisters Silent at a Time when Harlem Churches Fight for Survival
“From a historical perspective, the elders I talked to told me there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
"Today, there is neither one nor another."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understood.
“People socialize differently,” he said.
“The bars have ceased to be the living rooms of the neighborhood where people are regularly heading.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the eventuality of the money earned with the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders hope” and that, sooner or later, everything will return exactly to the starting point.
The churches, he added, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the kind of people who will not support the shrines in the neighborhood that remain.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so it will hurry the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, because most of those who move to these complexes are unlikely to join these congregations.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was later erected by a black congregation that held its worships in the vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major commercial street in Harlem that resisted hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, however, when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the carriage.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the galley "the bells of the poor".
The expert who touched the carriage in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also mentioned that he was the world’s first gallery to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest gallery at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the church's lay leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that the diocese would "try to redo its costs", to a bad degree the fact that it had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Teenager in California Lagostic Scuba Diving
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a scuba diving in California on the first day of the scuba season, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour as long as he heard the boy scream for help, after which he flew in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for grabbing a pond, but then realized that the boy was screaming "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The entire area of the clavicule was stretched, Hammel described what he observed when he reached the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The life-saving Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the top of the trunk.
Authorities closed access from Point Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic sections in the style of large warehouses, supported by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain market share in the UK cosmetics market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion clothes and household items back down, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores that will be spread out over the country and will be implemented in the year.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the demand, by supermarkets, for ways to use exhibition space used once for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty product catalogue with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also gain more space with brand areas similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products obey vegan recipes, something increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London, last week. The second, in Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and changing food shopping habits to small daily quantities in nearby stores have led supermarkets to now have to work harder to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, executive chairman of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses, at a time when the supermarket chain is trying to combat discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has been installing Argos sales points in hundreds of stores, having also installed a series of Habitats, having acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that such has strengthened merchandise sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The company’s previous attempt to renew its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of health product store revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
The company said Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the customer.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby quit <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business
"Dragons Den star Peter Jones was "fury" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby abandoned a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for branding household items and accessories True.
The business of both had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she would quit the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones alive by abandoning the last-minute lucrative brand to focus on her highly profitable new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "raged" when the TV gold girl admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (which could cost her <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) meant she had to leave her time off.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he would leave True, Jones was taking a plane to one of his vacation homes abroad.
A source said: “Truely was by far the highest of Holly’s priorities.
It would mean the resolution of its future in the long run and would be financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely shocked.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of ready-made items for sale at the headquarters in Marlow.”
Experts believe that the release of the This Morning presenter, one of Britain’s most profitable watchdogs, could cost the company millions, given the bulky investment in products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for additional delays of the launch.
In addition, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's I'm A Celebrity show host.
A source close to Jones said last night that “we don’t intend to make comments about his business.”
A hard conversation "and then we fall in love"
The U.S. president jokingly mentioned the criticism he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider “indigent to a president” and for revealing such a positive attitude to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his pretended voice of “tele-journal beer.”
"I don't give in to anything."
Kim said he was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, stressing that it would be a major step in North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, the negotiations for denuclearization are dragging.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “corresponding response” from the United States to the first steps toward North Korea’s disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in his speech at the committee.
"It's running very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have this excellent relationship.”
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the remains of American military.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when he spoke in relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on island, killing hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had been displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for international aid channelling.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been clear to declare that they are not asking for international help; so it becomes a bit difficult," Subung said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team that will head to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said the Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether it would be allowed for international agencies to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly poorly prepared for the angers of nature.
Although they have been built in Aceh, tsunamis shelters are not commonly seen on other coastlines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palu, poor degree of validity of a warning, had contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, traveling among the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship parked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who made the infrastructure improvement decrepit a central part of his election campaign, spent huge amounts on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has hampered Mr. Joko’s executive at a time when he faces his re-election next year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge makes a long shot to the goal of scoring against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea, with a 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 yards from the Chelsea beacon, with his team losing by 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before making a shot towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed to the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to reach that position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq are moving as far as possible, so I was just gaining as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I gave him a touch, and I didn't think too much about it, I just finished it."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the interval after scoring a goal in the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this game, the forward of the blues gave Mateo Kovacic a backward heel pass before demarcating near the midfield and sprinting towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick pass to midfield.
He then made a beautiful shot that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the large area.
He went over the defenses and scored against the second beam net with a left foot shot that passed Liverpool's Alisson Becker net guard.
Liverpool faced Naples in the Champions League group stage at three in the afternoon on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at three in the afternoon on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami death toll rose to 832, the country's disaster response agency said earlier Sunday.
There are reports that describe a large number of people trapped in the demolition of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the debris of the buildings that collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after crushing a woman to death
A murder investigation was initiated after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The victim, 44, was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street, with a 32-year-old man detained on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged the population in the area that may have witnessed something to give information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to all those who were in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspicious of contacting us.
I also want to appeal to those who may have obtained images with boarding cameras, particularly taxi drivers, to contact us as they may have crucial information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was located within a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the victim headed to the scene to inquire about where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are underway, with police notifying the victim's close relatives at the moment.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to access his apartment, but was informed by police that entrances or exits of the building are prohibited.
When he was informed of what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being informed that they will only be able to return to their homes in hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
Repeatedly he says, “It’s so horrible.”
At two o’clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the cordon and another was parked in the area immediately outside.
A number of police officers were deployed inside the cordon to monitor the apartment building.
We ask those who have information to contact DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 from September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament became the most recent monument swallowed by the "historical revisionism" contest
Its removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for its destruction, which reminds the Taliban of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that, in the current debate on the removal of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell next to the Westminster Palace would become a target to be slaughtered.
The iconoclasty of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony to the 19th-century opinion and part of historiography of a figure that many still believe to be worthy of honor.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is faced by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes a fully accurate description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually notorious figure representing one side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of homage and celebration.”
Pig Killer Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut and blood-covered artery, near a grocery store in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines in pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he will have travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open neighboring stove.
In that bag, he said, was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, with 227 kilograms, had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed," said the cousin, referred to by his nickname "Wu", according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been shut down to prevent it from attacking other people as police gather evidence at the scene.
Reports say Yuan’s family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to amaze the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can function as a “stimulant.”
"They're just kidding.
They like to fight, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just have to show them the due respect,” he said.
Hurricane Pink Residues Should Bring Strong Rain to the Southwest of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and southwestern the United States in the coming days.
At 5 a.m., East Time on Sunday, Rosa caused hurricanes of 137 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
However, a depression over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to take shape as it moves toward the western coast of the United States. As it approaches the California Peninsula, Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity toward the north in the southwestern part of the United States.
On Monday it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, the tropical moisture interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rains in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain can cause sudden hazardous flooding, sweeping debris, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in areas of the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There are possible sudden flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions, due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is highly advisable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
The heavy rainfall can cause the paragliders to turn into brazen rivers and the thunderstorms will bring strong point winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring heavy rainfall on parts of the southern coastline of California.
Total precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which can cause small rubbish of debris and slippery roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the wet season in the region.
A few tropical waterfalls will begin to occur in Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more dispersed at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The month of October may experience strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. territory as the Arctic cools. However, tropical zones will remain fairly mild.
Sometimes, this leads to drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic temperature differences across the central U.S. zone on Sunday.
There is a nearly 11-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will tend to increase and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. area is expected to experience a hot beginning in October, with temperatures ranging from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could hit 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high likelihood of above-average temperatures occurring in the eastern US zone until the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's audience
More than 20 million people watched yesterday on six television stations witness Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impasse continued, with stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute turnaround: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Commission that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh stabbed her while drunk and tried to fire her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, said he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, the number reported by Nielsen on Friday, have attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen often finds it difficult to measure audiences of those who see programs in offices.
To give some perspective, it is a level of audience similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscars ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole-day audience, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
Then come CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement stating that his vote would be in favour of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and verbally attacked by protesters when he was trying to enter an elevator to head a hearing.
The senator remained motionless looking at the floor as he was being criticized live for CNN’s cameras.
"I'm here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that “you have power while so many women have no power.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closes, it would have more to say at the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to make Kavanaugh's appointment continue for a plenary vote in the Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, something the Democratic minority had come to demand.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of “making politics” with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “doing politics” with Britain’s future and of damaging national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview he gave on the first page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the minister’s “Chequers Plan” for Brexit, stating that a proposal that provides Britain and the EU to cover tariffs is “absurd from the other side.”
Wayde Sims Homicide: Police Detain Dyteon Simpson Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police arrested a suspect in the murder of Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the Sims and Simpson confrontation, with police claiming that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them at the scene and said they had found Simpson’s DNA in them, reports WAFB, a CBS subsidiary.
After interrogating Simpson, police reported that he had fatally hit Wayde with a gun.
A <0x24>350,000 bail was established, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge parish medical law firm issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of the death was a bullet wound in the head extending to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police Action Group, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and residents of the area who collaborated in the investigation led to this detention.
LSU’s athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the local authorities for their “diligence and effort to get justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
This advanced, 1.98 m tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what worries us all the time," Wade said.
Volcano ejects ashes in Mexico City
Ash emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano hit the neighborhoods south of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in a 24-hour space.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have reported an increase in volcanic activity, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between Catalan police and separatists before independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independent protesters and the intervention police, as thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, trapped by the intervention police, hit her with eggs and cast dust ink, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are normally full of tourists.
There were also later clashes, in which the police resorted to sticks to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independentist groups singing “Don’t forget, don’t forgive” faced unionist protesters shouting “Long life for Spain”.
Fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries suffered in the protests, the local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region inclined to independence, one year after the October 1 referendum that was considered illegal by Madrid but was held by the Catalan separatists.
The voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although the influx to the polls had been low, with a majority boycott of those who are against it.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing vote at polling stations spread throughout the region, resulting in violent clashes.
Independent groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
Although it was carried out, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year, we lived our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry for joy to be able to vote, but now we’re blocked,” he said.
Despite having achieved a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independentist parties have struggled to maintain impetus this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police with his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained for trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year’s elections.
"Presenting me as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we witness on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Car Crash Against House
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after a car crashed repeatedly in a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone may also have fired a beast against the car.
Menga Attack Gives Livingston a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second loss of just two in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference at a time when Gary Holt's team changed their level, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s team, which remains homeless in the first division this season, will face the Hearts leaders with an additional eight points next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
However, Livingston extended his six-game succession of defeatless clashes in the division to head coach Holt without losing once since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against crowded visitors
Holt’s team should have gone ahead on the scoreboard long before the goal, as the incisive character of his game was causing all sorts of trouble to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but he let himself drag in front of the beacon and then Alan Lithgow only managed to direct his effort away after slipping to find Craig Halkett's heading over the beacon.
The home team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause trouble for the visitors in the stop-ball games.
And that’s how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers granted a free kick and the Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, which gave a touch and scored from the center of the large area.
At that point, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems.
This pattern went on in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a touch away from another Livingston stop-ball game.
They continued to come crossings to the large area of Livingston, which were successively resolved, and two great-punishment claims, one after Halkett's investiture on the substitute Glenn Middleton and the other after one hand, were rejected by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations in this upward trajectory.
His style of play and staff have little changed since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to do their best throughout the game.
Anyway, the Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality sometimes demonstrated with Gerrard, the team was very low in these standards.
Their final game was little inspired (only once they managed to open the home team), forming a kind of warning to the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received ambiguously in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, whose goal was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new and gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside its country.
The police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up in the immediate vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard, condemning both the president’s policies and the German government’s decision to host him in the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisionist character of a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, near 10:15 British Summer Time.
The driver stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died on the spot.
This collision occurs months after the death of another cyclist in a runaway collision on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were trying to identify the person and inform their relatives.
Barriers and shifts were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Injured in Disorder
Six inmates were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The riots, which are still ongoing, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 British Summer Time on Saturday.
Special agents "Tornado" were summoned to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one wing.
Agents were treated for minor facial injuries on site.
A Prison Service spokesman said: “Specially trained teams were used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and these will be able to spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were summoned to resolve a serious disorder in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Pink threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (drought-affected areas may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it’s exactly what it’s predicted to be at the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for southern and eastern areas of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the end of Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression within a 300 km radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that crossed 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden flooding, the Rosa rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona suffers at least extreme drought, the second most severe category,” the weather.com website reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will reach the continental mass across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning, with winds at peak speeds of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is weakening.
Thus, it is expected to hit the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at the fall of Monday night.
There may be heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
“Total precipitation is expected 8 to 10 mm from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, with possible maximums of 25 mm,” the weather.com website said.
Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. This will then head south of Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
“The main expected danger of the Rose or its residues is very high precipitation in Lower California, northwestern Sonora, and southwestern U.S. Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is predicted that these rains will produce sudden and sweeping debris in the deserts, with life-threatening, and alloys on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempting to Murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with cutting gun injuries in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the area of the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton near 4:00 British Summer Time on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were detained during the night in the Radstock area, police said in a statement.
Agents have appealed to everyone who may have cell phone footage of the incident to present themselves.
Trump says Kavanaugh "was the victim of the evil and rage" of the Democratic Party
“A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the relentless and ultrasounding Democratic Party tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "was the victim of the Democratic Party's maliciousness and anger" during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying vigorously and emotionally a charge against Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the hearing about his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliantness, quality and courage" on that day.
“A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote by one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a jurist with a brilliant public service curriculum,” he said.
The president later referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican influx to the polls in the interim elections.
“We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not competing, but I’m competing,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting all over the world for excellent candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior deputy of the Republican Party leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia; number continues to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of them dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high struck the beach at dawn, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred as a result of a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, having been victims of the incident,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency (BNPB) in a statement.
"The tsunami was not moving on its own: it dragged cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, deformed and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive hurricane was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the dimension of the tsunami, the statement reads.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the debris of the demolished buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications “were totally incapacitated and there was no information” about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had emerged at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage posted on social media, you can see a man on the upper floor of a building screaming frenetic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, to the people on the street below.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water fell off the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the filming.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive energy cut that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still desperately need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo made a visit to Palau’s evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia is growing exponentially to more than 800.
It's very bad.
Although he has managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where the staff are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of his offices, the World Vision staff of Donggala have gone through scenes of devastation along their way, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to start the dark tasks of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and foreign personnel can only have access to the site if it is declared a "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still at a level of provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says ‘OK, this is a national disaster’ we can open the doors to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist.”
As the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of the still missing still kept the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that mitigate the dark spots of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of the inmates at Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior paragliding practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon said that, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel’s demolition began circulating among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, their messages produced only a gray check mark, rather than a pair of blues.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves take <0x24>26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, robbers stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's employee who was refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department statement.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "runned behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the site, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name - to Ye.
In announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Being formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, received Ye's nickname some time ago and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before her participation in Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
At the same time as an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think "ye" is the word most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible means "you," West said earlier this year, when he commented on the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"Therefore, I am you, I am us, we are us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the one," to only Ye - being only a reflection of our good, of our evil, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was alternately known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphen and mayonnaise.
In Mexico, AMLO commits not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador has pledged not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
Military fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have risen to 300, when leftist student movements were deployed throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more public universities.
The president said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are dragging young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. Should Double the Financing of Artificial Intelligence
At a time when China is reinforcing its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. is expected to double its research spending, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional in the area who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments made AI-related announcements, even though the country does not have a global formal strategy on the matter.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in AI by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, as all the other countries are so behind the U.S. and we are looking for a new revolution in AI,” Lee said.
Duplicating funding could double the chances of the next big AI success being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello's best-ranked American player. Later he held executive roles at Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google's China branch.
Lee credited previous U.S. government technology contests as the Defense Department’s Robotics Challenge and asked when it would be the next one to help identify upcoming visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to make a great effort to get state funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s stealing academic leaders; it’s the companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaires from universities to work in AI.
Lee pointed out that changes to immigration policies could also help the U.S. to boost its AI efforts.
“I am of the opinion that green cards should automatically be granted to doctorates in AI,” he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in a manner similar to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Artificial Intelligence Committee.
In addition, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment this month in an AI Next-designated initiative.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation that aimed to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on country name change
The Macedonians went to vote on Sunday to decide on the country's name change to "Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbor to the north represents a complaint about its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, mostly Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the influx to the polls will be enough to meet the 50% necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question of the referendum was: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue admission efforts in agencies with the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs said they would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no records of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the influx was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters came to vote.
“I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old elector in Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in the referendum on the country’s name change, which would open the doors for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents that would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up and not through the door of service,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to receive us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO entry will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
According to him, a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than the necessary influx.
Another poll, conducted by Telma TV of Macedonia, found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the influx must be more than 50% plus a vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major break in pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero crosses all of Brighton's defense towards goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling omitted Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win against Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
I can make it seem ridiculously easy on your goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the game.
He sprinted between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach open field.
It was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fined a defense before neutralizing others in the race on the borders of the large Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the large area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's goalkeeper with a shot to the right side of the net.
"Aguero is debating with some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League confrontation.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball well in Brighton territory in this game.
He made a pass over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues advanced kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the field limits.
City faced Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life difficult for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there were not many reasons to force another start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer has hopes to get on the pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the final for the Rockies, who hold a lead in a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their first division title.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, at least we can get into the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete under these conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the title launcher for Sunday, but some say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the launches in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, held a session at the bullpen on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander goes 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president later referred to the situation involving his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican influx in the interim elections.
“Everything we did is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ... I’m not competing, but I’m competing and that’s why I’m all over the place fighting for excellent candidates.”
Trump continued, “They’re watching this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, they’re seeing it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using all the necessary means. Are they seeing evil, deafness?
No matter who they are, who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of “resisting and obstructing.”
"And they've seen this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive, evil, sordid and liars."
The president referred to by the name of Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, having received soundtracks from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you cause the document to run away?
Hey, hey, what?
No, um, no, I, wait, one -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant to those who openly give their opinion
When the Momentum activists of my local party organization voted to censor me, it was not a surprise to me.
In the end, I am the most recent of a number of Labour MPs in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues with which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice to the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday mentioned that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in Parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, it has ceased to be the tone of many meetings and the promise of "more kind and gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if ever it has been realized.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy took over the leadership, because the colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political outlook began to expect a turning point from me and to take positions with which I would never agree - whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn’t really matter what I say), there is a torrent of insults on social networks that call for “dismissal”, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying to me that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political.
I am shocked by the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a dam of sexist or racist insults every day, but never back before them.
One of the aspects that most disappoint me in this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with every motion of "censorship" or change of the rules of selection the party narrows its views.
I have received countless advice over the last two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so expressive, and that thus "everything would be fine" for me.
But that's not why I came to do politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of Thatcher’s government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in ruins, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, either as an autarch or as a minister in the government.
I never concealed my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country is heading for a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Momentum of Nottingham; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "dismissal" or political records will stop me from acting in the sense of what I believe are all interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late rehearsals have somehow outsmarted the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the 10 without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and a better management of the risks that made the home team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Merit goes to Ayr. They manage the risks better than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute essay, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the front, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to express the numbers, having Jason not converted to a Bagdoesai.
Climo extended Ayr's advantage with a great penalty, before, immediately before the mid-time, having scored and then converted a ground trial to place the score at 17-5 for Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced the draw to five points.
A long interruption followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was transported from maca to abroad and, after the restart, Ayr reinforced leadership with a Stafford McDowall trial converted by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and once again Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted essay by Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense push-up.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Climo without the ball, at the penalty kick, MacPherson placed the ball on the floor behind the mall in progress from Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe had picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing to the home team's fifth rehearsal.
Still Game Star Ready for a New Career in the Restoration Business
Ford Kieran, Still Game star, appears ready to enter the restoration industry after learning that he has been appointed director of a licensed restoration company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which writes and participates with longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the ninth season, which will be released soon, will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was pretending to be involved in the "flowering Glasgow restoration business".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a coastless country, expects the court to reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a naval base covered with ropes in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue-sea flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a lost coastline for Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive, as well as the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a judgement by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course, a positive outlook on the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the verdict of the TIJ on gigantic screens spread across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favour of their country's complaint, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign departure.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot in play in Monday’s sentence.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” the president’s votes were last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even otherwise.
The U.N. body, based in the Netherlands, has no powers to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the TIJ’s sentence is passed just six months after hearing the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have harmed it.
“The question of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric mined some Chilean residual goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision process was unusually fast.
Next Monday it will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility of "ending 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political mule.
“Bolivia will never be deprived of its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to go beyond the past.”
North Korea says there will be no disarmament without the country trusting the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation would never be exempt from its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to keep the promises they made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival countries.
His comments arise when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy in an impasse, more than three months after Singapore’s summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "impossible dream" to consider that the continued sanctions and the US objection to a declaration that puts an end to the Korean war will ever lead the North to kneel.
Washington is afraid to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism as to whether Pyongyang actually intends to reduce an arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion parades in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the passport a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which stunned the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very unpractical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the crossroads.
The most prominent piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a broad tab similar to a feather that flooded the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry-created melons, a wizard hat, and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even at carnival time.
Many of the colorful masks had baked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high seams.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tubes and glasses, while another resembled a melted ice cone.
And if you want to continue this huge fashion affirmation, you are lucky.
Styling observers predict that these huge hats are on the way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent on the path of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm arrow that has been worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very practical hat that spread over social networks sent another great creation to the passers-by: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the bathing suit that carried it.
The raffia bag in burnt orange, decorated with raffia stripes and with a white leather grip, was the highlight of Jacquemus’s spring-summer collection La Riviera 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing large hats and beach bags arrive in stores next summer. Since the designer had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills are Essential for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, with this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for deepening their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of conceiving and implementing a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we talk to him in his own language, we can get into his heart.”
This quote reminds us well that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent exams, we check that the languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of exploitation of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum rating of A.
These data, collected from the 74 schools under the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained the maximum score of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are favoring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now addressed in the same way as STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and more.
A UK Employment and Skills Commission survey in 2014 found that among the reasons for employers’ difficulty filling vacancies, 17% were related to a lack of linguistic skills.
Knowing other languages is therefore increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities requiring knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this one.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit ratio, 15%.
Therefore, investing now in language teaching is important for today’s children.
The multilingual skills, particularly those in developing countries, will give children the best chance of finding a relevant job.
In Scotland, each school is different in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important to the UK for the 2020 horizon, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by specialist teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills necessary for success, whatever the future reserves them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence to young Scots.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is over for fans who want to see LeBron James start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will take part in Sunday’s pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was questioned about his plans for the Lakers six-game schedule in the pre-season.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump's comedy in West Virginia
President Donald Trump starts a round of campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallys scheduled for next week, which include stops at friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the pending conformation vote for his chosen for the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to strengthen support for the interim elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s funeral in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is set for 7 p.m., East Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below on a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s hearings to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The confirmation vote scheduled in the Senate will remain pending for a week as the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main goal of this rally stream is to help Republicans, who are facing difficult elections in November, gain some impetus.
President Trump’s campaign officials said the five next week’s summit aims to “energize volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so fundamental to the president’s agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the tumult of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman said.
Marked for the Wesbank Arena in Wheeling, the late-night rally will be able to attract supporters “from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh area media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday marks the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey in the West Virginia polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates they have the strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday's singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of impetus is a fully invented sporting concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum will come now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so we're looking at this as a bit of impetus, I'd say," said Jordan Spieth as he was leaving the field at the end of the day.
Europe is in advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points in four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those festive screams became louder as the round went on, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt that won the 15th game produced a similar scream, of the kind that reveals that he still believes the American team is still in the competition.
"We just need to focus and worry about our own game," Spieth said.
This is all the rest for each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The European couple, unlikely but adorable, is four out of four and cannot be mistaken.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, it consolidates the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory at sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the speech on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, this morning’s fourball hero, when teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine pushed the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole they were never close to exiting.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has acquired a significant advantage in the final day. However, this foursome session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a kick-off advantage after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday's games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The duel inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods with difficulty reaching the four-point Le Golf National ranking so far.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, struggling to keep the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series by 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two wins, but failed to shorten the draw.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points on Sunday's singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row when he and Molinari, who received the nickname of "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the only duet to win four points in their four Ryder Cup opening matches.
Having smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating a powerless Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more enphatic 5&4.
Woods, who pulled out during two games on Saturday, revealed occasional genius accesses, but has already lost 19 of the matches he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third in the world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a slight breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always bring the best.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of the men's major tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duo won a brave 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team reversed a four-point draw before the singles, although Furyk’s team, who holds the title, only needs to empathize to keep the trophy.
After two days in second place, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea Says 'Don't Think' on Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was aggravating distrust of the United States and there was no way the country could unilaterally suspend its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as the discontinuation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing centre and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
“However, we don’t see any corresponding US response,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we can proceed with our disarmament first.”
Although Ri has recycled known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization approach, within which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, its statements appear to be significant as far as anti-nuclearization is concerned, as they have not previously rejected them.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a U.S. president in exercise and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the North Korean peninsula," while Trump offered Coas security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to coercively achieve its goal, opposing the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the prolongation of the sanctions is aggravating our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party involved in this issue were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was drastically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that steering North Korea’s rockets toward U.S. territory was inevitable after Trump called Kim “the man of rockets” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said there was still much to do and that sanctions would have to continue until denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no calendar for that, saying “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable.”
The Security Council unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006 in an attempt to strangle North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although North Korea later denounced him for “making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States “takes appropriate measures.”
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they were looking for were security guarantees taken by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses that teach them to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep more, an initiative to combat the macho culture of studying in "direct" caffeine-impregnated.
One professor concluded that students at this university at the top of the world rankings often had no idea about the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course came after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to meet me and said, ‘Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?’
She said no one had ever mentioned her the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom where students click on coffee cups, curtains, shoe pads and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to collect in bed.
In another section participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, just as we all have the right to know the health effects of smoking,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in “making straight” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we sleep enough and with quality should be a “secret weapon” of the students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid obesity, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, making them constantly starving.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical biology and chemistry, helped Professor Czeisler conceive the course after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to your expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm for the time to go to bed, as well as to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can de-regulate the circadian rhythm and lead to trouble.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another out-of-home access sadness when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disjointed team a 1-0 defeat at Livingston Stadium.
The Ibrox team tried to record their first win on their track since the 1-0 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team ended up inflicting Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind unbroken Hearts, the leader of the first division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half and the Rangers collective, devoid of inspiration, never seemed to be able to equal.
With the Rangers now descending to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third, and only behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And even more problems may arise for the Rangers after line prosecutor Calum Spence received treatment of a head injury caused by an apparently shot object from the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that surpassed Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, for his part, used the same Livingston eleven that stole a point to the Hearts last week, and will have been delightful in the way his well-wave team suffocated opponents in each game.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have scored soon after two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's ball, but the average wasted his great opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs was to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to finish out towards the second lap.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in his game in the final quarter.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought that he should have been awarded a great quarter-hour penalty with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian appeals.
The Rangers scored only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livingston's goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected of the game's development, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, as much as it is not due to its tenacity.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs’ long-stop ball play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when choosing Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, and this shift almost had an immediate impact when the forward passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to effect the blockage.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long pass after long pass.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor handled well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Ranger's substitute, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a major penalty when he tied himself up at Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request once again.
Almanaque: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our "Sunday Morning" Almanaque: On September 30, 1882, it is now 136 years old and continues CONTAR ... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, Counter Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which improbable cow scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When we put on these headphones, we can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Look, you're really creeping right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention to which he gave the name still persists.
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches Immune System to “See” Harmful Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches Immune System to “See” Harmful Cells and Kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory.
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then re-injected into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2. These cells are then re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancers", including those of the breast, ovary, lungs and also colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and “teaching them” to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a Trump-supporting diatribe enveloping a MAGA hat after his appearance in the SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was cast in the studio on Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, stating that he would run for the 2020 presidential election.
After performing his song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he launched a bravate against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white man and he tells me, 'How can you like Trump? He's racist!'
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star cut off Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it hadn't been broadcast, West's bravata scene was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to change West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They intimidated me in the backyard.
They told me, "Don't go there with that hat."
They've intimidated me!
And then they tell me I’m marginalized,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the marginalization?", saying, "I wore my super-man coat, because that means no one tells me what to do.
Try the love."
Their comments provoked public whims and participants in the SNL appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, having someone on the show told the newspaper: “The whole studio was completely silent.”
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of Perrier's I Love It Bottle Masked song.
West received a demonstration of support from TPUSA conservative group director Candace Turner, who posted the tweet: "To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR ENCOURAGED THE TURBA."
However, interview show host Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying West was simply “being what it is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying their music or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe is hosting and propagating harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And we too,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that it was now "to be previously known as Kanye West."
West is not the first artist to change his name, following the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg has already used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder after smashing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was smashed at a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought to the Belfast Court on Monday.
The allegations will be reviewed by the public ministry.
Star of Thrones War Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, War of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that such roles on the screen make boys often feel like they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the War of the Thrones, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he has a "pretty strong position" as to how to deal with the problem.
“I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men when they’re growing up in terms of the problem we’re seeing now?”
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he said, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because obviously something went very bad for the young people.”
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequels or sequels to the War of the Thrones when the series ends next summer, stating that, for him, the "fighting camps and the horses" ended.
Starting in November, Kit will participate in a reissue of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the War of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmys award-winning fantasy series.
The couple gave the node in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual intercourse, which marks a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies estimated that, due to the country’s conservative values, 70 to 90% of men who had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases derive from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leak of information about Republican senators by a colleague and attacks “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information from three members of the U.S. Senate on legislators’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the accusations were being promoted by opinion leaders and “ultraright” websites.
"Lies, lies, and more detestable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes addresses and phone numbers of Utah Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The information leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and published data from a Waters staff member, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised under these fraudulent and false allegations, has no responsibility for this information leak.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly attracted online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is cholera," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they cannot be angry.
You can't have a challenging attitude.
You can't question the prosecutor's motives.
It has to reveal calm and serenity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will contest Waters' place in the interim elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his cabinet had alerted "competent authorities" to these fraudulent allegations.
"We assure that the culprits will be disclosed, and will be legally held accountable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Johnny English Review Back to Attack - Weak Parody of Spy Film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British flavor, and such seems in fact to apply to the new edition in the comedy and action film series Johnny English, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-sacrifice on the theme of being so bad the new export opportunity to the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes shuffled and an excessively elastic expression obtained his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than anything, that it is a comprehensive comic creation intended for non-Anglophone cinematographers.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean and something of that slut who contributed with a single note to the theme of the film "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in Barclaycard's TV ads, which left chaos in his tracks.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene in which Johnny English approaches a helicopter sweeping a medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a carriage noise against the helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for comedy is obvious, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that “serious” films such as the 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We have the idea that humor is aimed at children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s bizarre misfortunes are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film numbers on Bean’s character.
Now, the always current premise is that Britain is in grave danger.
A computer pirate infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground for consternation of the service agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a prime minister who incarnate a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering a total breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that makes her look like Theresa May’s character, but the argument doesn’t give much material for big flights.
Her secret service advisers tell her that once all the agents on the asset have been compromised, she will have to pull someone out of the retreat.
And this one is the disastrous Johnny English, now working as a teacher at a chic school, but giving unofficial lessons on how to be an infiltrated spy: here are some interesting numbers, as English offers us a spy academy in the style of the film "Rock School".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoin his suffering auxiliary Bough, the role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to a submarine commander, a melting character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the Catastrophe in His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the deadly beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova, the role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously enchanted by the charismatic billionaire technology he claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, performed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd disastrous acts: disguised as desk employees, set fire to a lively French restaurant, create confusion by penetrating like clandestines in the luxurious yacht of Volta, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use inside glasses of virtual reality to make himself familiar.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but no matter how nice and stormy, the set has plenty of children's TV.
The result is quite medium.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but question: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to her talent?
Workers denounce that they are generating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day week of work, but with five days of pay.
Reports suggest that the party wants employers to pass on savings with the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers, giving them an additional day off.
Workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping the order.
Sources say the idea "would be adjusted" to the party's economic program, which reorients the country in favour of the workers.
The passage to a four-day work week gained the favourable opinion of the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: “We look forward to announcing a policy review by the end of the year.
“It won’t happen from one day to the next, but a four-day week of work is an aspiration tailored to the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the party’s overall strategy for the industrial sector.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative election.
However, this aspiration is not favoured at this time by the whole Labour Party.
A party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy and we are not considering it.”
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the hands of “faceless directors” and “speculators” of basic service companies.
Their plans also include not recovering the full share of current shareholders of water companies, since the Labour Party may make “deductions” based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place employees on the company’s boards and create inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the private companies’ share to employees, which could envelope dividends that may amount to as much as <0xC2><0xA3>500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh can make them or not change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would change their minds.
Kennedy proved to be more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said when I was going to the hearing,” he said, “I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this claim appeared, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems immutable.
“I’m as determined as Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be needed,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vivid denial," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentioned was unable to confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars that will act on an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people at Central Park’s Great Grass, not only to attend performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the true goal of the event: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a defence group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to perform a number of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a target call, or any other significant ways to contribute to the increase of fidelity.
However, what was the success rate of Global Citizen over the past 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading them to demand action, or is this just another case of "clickism" - do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have put pressure on it to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, contributed to global leaders announcing commitments and policies valued at more than <0x24>37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements from its actions, with at least <0x24>10 billion for them already being disbursed or hired.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership that brings together investors and implementers committed to “help children reach their full potential,” which promised to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make social injustice of undernutrition a footnote of history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd in London in a live concert.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions of pressure on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced it would fund a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the site’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replies: “It was a long and tortuous journey – sometimes we fell and failed.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy as "blocking" to put an end to Russia's energy exports
"If necessary," Washington may use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, notably where the legitimate government’s invitation intervenes, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they intend to intermediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the governor, there are ways and means to stop it.
“The United States has the capacity, with its navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to make blockades to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called "the energy consumer's voice" in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “magic of one trick” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration’s authorities, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the Nord Stream pipeline, budgeted at <0x24>11 billion, aims to double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic reasons, being an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers,” Russia’s energy minister Aleksandr Novak said in a meeting with U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow.
The US position motivated a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, chief executive of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “deeply analyze” the possibility of running for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "deeply analyze" the possibility of running for president following the interim elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the highest responsible,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will consider in-depth the possibility of running for president.”
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, stating that he was “guiding the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and his nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “It’s clear that we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s constituents themselves are not in the opinion that she should run for president in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll from the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Policy Research Center.
32% gave their support to their nomination.
The poll revealed greater support for a candidate from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidate and 48% against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated regarding a potential 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's post-traumatic stress at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq following his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what’s going on after he’s back, I can identify with other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers are actually coming back with,” he told a panel in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the detention "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "go back a little different, go back hardened, go back to investigate whether there is such respect for what his comrades soldiers and aviators, and all other members of the armed forces, gave the country."
Track Palin was detained on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and gun possession while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support opposition to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are giving their support to a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts sent a statement amicus curiae (court friends) Friday in support of an asylum seeker who is contesting this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in Grace vs. Sessions trial that the American Civil Liberties Union intervened in August against the policy was not revealed.
The person claimed that her partner "and her children, members of a violent gang", abused her, but U.S. officials dismissed her asylum application on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
The public ministries that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing widespread gang-related problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 Immigrant Resources Council decision allowing fugitives without documents of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international laws.”
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle," the statement reads.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the police ban on immigrants from entering negatively affects the U.S. economy, citing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “dispose of the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion,” Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been destined to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of dead doubles in a counterclockwise to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, 35, the mother of a febrile male baby, while comforting him at an evacuation center in the ravaged city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their water-soaked belongings.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who broke his ribs and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated abroad due to the strong replicas that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he reported how he felt when the violent earthquake struck him in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I got stuck in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then, silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Intimidation' with 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid supplement on the Des Moines Register, the most outspoken newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, a charge denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked the beginning of what U.S. officials, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it’s normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently ending an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides impose tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliation tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion paper in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now putting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press.”
“With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is harnessing the acrimonious American tradition of freedom of expression and the press by publishing a paid ad on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
“In contrast, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissident voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of opinions that the Chinese may have of their country’s worrying economic trajectory, as the media is under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not mention which.
Republicans alienate female voters before interim elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
At a time when many prominent Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against the various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this could spark a negative reaction, particularly women, during the interim elections to take place soon.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and the majority of Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move forward for a vote.
These things don't have a backlash," he told The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Republican) to carry out an FBI investigation would be enough to soothe rebel voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the MoveOn group, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is at the door!" as they protested in the Senate hall, as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will break all records,” political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news website.
“People say it’s already high; it’s true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among indecisive voters in suburban areas and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the nominee to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans advance with the confirmation.
"This has become a joke for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as judge, it’s also about how Republicans handled the matter and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about whom to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new YouGov survey revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they considered that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s proposal, the FBI began an investigation into Ford’s allegations, as well as another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford cited under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually harassed her while she was alcoholic when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee for the Supreme Court exposed his genitals when the two attended a party during the period when they both studied in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web aims to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the underlying intention of Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data warehouse,” or POD.
This may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available in one browser and simultaneously.
What is unique about the online personal data warehouse is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data".
Inrupt’s idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to provide the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech makers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a complete change in which all of his business models are turned from one day to the next.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a press release on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Honoring a Clergyman Decorated with the Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only Church of England clergyman to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in his 100-year-old hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the condecoration on 29 September 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a franco-shooter four days later and never knew he was given the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren closed a memorial plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the event that gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion at the crossing of the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable weapons and machine guns".
He then ran to the fire line and, "with the greatest courage," led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and killing three troops from the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German franco-tirer on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never equal, but also a lesson in humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the stop, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honoured to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of mixed martial arts awakened all night to watch Bellator 206 watch Porca Peppa instead
Imagine this: you get up all night to see the Bellator 206, full of candlesticks and in the end, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San José series included 13 fights, with six from the main group, and was being shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At six o’clock in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, viewers in the UK were shocked when the cover changed to Porca Peppa.
Some weren’t impressed after they had been awake until morning especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad taste joke.”
"Government regulation says the content is not suitable for six in the morning, so they had to switch to another programming," said Dave Schwartz, director with the marketing and communications hub, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pussy Peppa, yes."
Bellator’s president Scott Coker said the company will rectify the schedule of broadcasts to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem,” Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on Sunday and we can't solve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I’m not lying when I say that when the schedule changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and none very nice.
We're trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it was not: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to exceed the expectations of the fans and we exaggerated.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels “Lower” About His Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that that gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she expressed support for gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also claimed that becoming a father made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The program’s long-time regular host, Kirsty Young, took a several-month leave due to illness.
Appearing as a paria on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "lower" than everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
In his words, “to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me the power and strength to achieve success.”
His goal was to prove that he was “someone,” he said, not to disappoint everyone when they discovered his sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “has caught me by surprise.”
Daley was married last year to the 20-year-old Oscar winner, though he said the age difference never posed a problem.
"When we go through so when we're so young" - his first participation in the Olympics was at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar highs and lows.
The couple had a son last year, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "everything from his perspective" had changed.
“If they asked me last year, all I mattered was to win a gold medal,” he said.
"But you know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact of going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to the London Games in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be around to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding him no hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: dive in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics ... there was no better feeling,” he said.
All this was also the inspiration for her first choice of song - Proud, by Heather Small - with which she had identified herself during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives her chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 British Summer Time.
Mickelson down on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Saturday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to regain his form to prevent the mark from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial event for the 12th time, a record of stakes, was sent to the bank by captain Jim Furyk at Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often been in the U.S. teams, the five-time winner of the men's major championships split the day between the role of supporter and the work in his field game, hoping to rectify what afflicts him.
Never having given the most straight kicks even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the Le Golf National field, where the long rough usually punishes the wrong kicks.
And if the field alone wasn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, will face precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four games played by them this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point draw to start the 12 singles matches, make a good start, Mickelson's match can prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could affirm much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a palm on my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He’s a respected champion who has given a lot to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn't seen him play two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we'd have to go on.
He wants to be in the game, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never equaled the successes of your individual curriculum.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
“He’s sarcastic, funny and spirited, he likes to play with people and he’s an excellent person to have in the team room,” he said.
“I think the youngest players had fun getting into it this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives more than just playing.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn Knows That His Great Advantage May Disappear
“Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows by experience that his lead when entering the last day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily become an accidental ride.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the goal line with the narrowest of the margins, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We always try to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by little," Bjorn said in the image, after watching the 2018 Tournament victory by 5-3, both on Friday and Thursday.
So the story has shown to me and to everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, do your best.
Go in there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should remain.
I’ve always said I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of who’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted by the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself in that.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is individual performance and this involves a different task.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we’re there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the fullest.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: tomorrow, do your best.
Now they’re going to leave the partner and he has to go and give the best of himself as well.”
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players perform better individually than as partners, with the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these big turns on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe pulled the "Miracle in Medinah" out of the card.
"I remember all the words," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this impetus turns to one side, the pressure is too high in these middle games.
We arranged our staff accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we will try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counterattack, confronts Rory McIlroy in the main game, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the run.
"I chose this group of players for this order because I think it covers the entire route," Bjorn said of his choices for singles.
New German Warship Delayed Again
The most recent German navy fragata should have entered service in 2014 to replace Cold War-time warships. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to failure and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
Admission to the service of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the command ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the navy in 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy had ordered in 2007 will be used to replace the aged Bremen-class fragatas.
They are known to be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-ships, as well as some stealth technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include extended periods between maintenance, which would allow sending the latest fragatas on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuous delays have made that with the latest-generation warships, considered a way for Germany to project power across borders, they will already be out of date when they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The unfortunate F125 made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it into service, having returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cite a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the contingent needed in the oldest Bremen class fragatas.
It was also known that the ship is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to install additional features in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, an increase from the 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems facing the latest frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliamentary defence committee, recognized that the navy is currently without ships capable of being used.
The politician claimed that the problem grew exponentially over time, as older ships were put out of service without any boats to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the navy.
The National Trust spies the secret life of the bats
New research is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing how bats use the landscape to look for food.
The results are expected to give some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit marshmallows, as well as the long-eared browns and the Daubenton marshmallows at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered throughout the property to follow the activities of the bats throughout the season.
Mobile studies will also be conducted by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
The analysis by experts of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of the call of the bats and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviors on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation adviser, expects the results to reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as farming, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development work that affect the bedrooms and make habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning strikes also pose a threat, along with flywheel papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
In fact, the bats are not blind.
However, given your night hunting habits, your ears are more useful than your eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
It is used by them a sophisticated echo location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes the bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct studies, inspections to the dorms and sometimes rescues.
It also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to hawks, on the Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish hawks.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says that the same is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there’s still a lot more about the bitches we don’t know, so the work we’re doing here and in the other properties will help us know more about what they need to bloom.”
He stressed the importance of checking if there are bites before making maintenance on the property, as the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dormitory can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Moths are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them, or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply don’t know how their populations are revenging.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as his lawyers prepare to prosecute German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” claiming that people “wanted to promote themselves” using his name.
Their lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The forward of the Portuguese and Juventus teams has been accused of raping an American woman identified as Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have then paid <0x24>375,000 to keep the alleged victim silent about the accident, reads Friday's Der Spiegel.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the allegations, 33-year-old Ronaldo described the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the winner of five Golden Balls said.
“We want to promote ourselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the profession.
I’m a happy man and it’s all right,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel on the allegations, which they described as “an unacceptable report of suspicions in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would demand compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player’s room, where he has raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99%" "a good guy", damaged by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she addressed police and had photographs of her injuries taken at a hospital, but that she would later agree to enter into an extrajudicial deal because she felt "terrorized by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now claims she wants to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, out of Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would regret forever' losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent forever" if it lost its world leader status in car manufacturing after Brexit, Secretary for Business Greg Clark said.
Clark also noted that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU messy at the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have expressed concerns about exiting the EU without an agreement on the level of operation of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are about what manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is managed on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU, for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there could be disturbances at the border, which the sector says could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stock in its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s “Chequers Plan” for future EU relations was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We need to have an agreement, we want to have the best deal that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the use by us of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers indicates that we absolutely need to be able to proceed with what has been a highly successful supply chain set.”
Although it has not been able to give an estimate of the downtime, Toyota said that in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and could, sooner or later, lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the Unite trade union at the site, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never return.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “added another week” given there is still no understanding as to what Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
The fact that Trump could be preparing for the deputy prosecutor’s deployment, putting Mueller’s independence at risk has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording talks with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with information that he would be about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would “prefer not to fire” Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Justice Commission hearing in which Kavanaugh witnessed and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press adviser, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not yet been marked, it may be this week but it may also be postponed another week, given everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with such a statement: Sanders has not organized a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not due to an aversion to TV reporters’ “protagonism,” though he said: “I wouldn’t disagree with the fact that they like protagonism.”
He then made it clear that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president makes more sessions of questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding any evidence: "We analyzed these numbers."
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We tried to do this often, and they saw that we have done it in the last few weeks, and the fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences, when he receives foreign representatives.
Press conferences on the ground are rare.
This week the president showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way in front of the journalists present.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service on Brexit fears
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to costing applications for the status of resident EU citizens working in the decentralised public services of the country.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have continued, and decisions are expected for this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without an agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationalities.
Colleagues from across the EU and from other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want it to continue here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers' defense, Christion Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of the Tigers reported.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He approached the side line and practically fainted," Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff put Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before laying it on a maca and transporting it to a more in-depth assessment.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/severity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended his studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five scorings on Saturday before leaving the game, raising his total of the season to 18 scorings.
Higher seal tax will be charged to foreign buyers when purchasing properties in the UK
The Conservative Party has announced plans to levy a higher seal tax on foreign buyers buying properties in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in aid to homeless people.
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract the youngest electorate
The increase in seal tax will affect buyers who are not taxed in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
A higher seal tax will be charged to foreign buyers who purchase properties in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in aiding homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises to provide more affordable housing and tax the higher incomes.
The increase in the seal tax will affect people and businesses who are not taxed in the UK, with additional revenue boosting the government’s campaign to offer a roof to homeless people.
The surcharge - added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second housing and rental purchases - could rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to allow up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, causing price rises and making it difficult for buyers of the first home to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "fantastic cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a seal tax cut to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping property prices high by embarking on land they don’t use, demanding that Mrs May abandon the quotas on affordable housing to solve the “unhappiness of housing” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a call for a set of housing reform proposals, including income controls and the end of "unjustified" evictions.
He also wants to give the municipalities extended powers for the construction of new homes.
“Last year I stated that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy a home for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as for UK residents.
For too many people, the dream of being the owner of your home has become too far away and the shame of those who sleep in the slumber continues to be too real.
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his "stop ambition" is to become Scotland's picker.
The 42-year-old Scottish has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the northeastern club, currently ranked third in the First League, at three leading points.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got an internationalization B," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if it succeeds in managing clubs.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he felt no fear of successing such dedicated names in such a big club, after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, at the moment, success is summarized as 'Can I get the club back to the Premier League?'
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League."
"It will not be easy to get the club back, but I will only consider that I was successful here when I reached that goal."
Ross’s career as a coach is only three years old, after a period as a deputy coach for Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of de-promotion to the championship title in the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crossroads," he recalls.
“I’ve always seen myself more as a coach than a player.
It sounds strange because it went well, I earned my life as a player and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and pressure from the job, but I feel very well as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I’ve ever felt throughout my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a study
The summer heatwave filled the British pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Restoration groups recorded a 2.7% growth in sales in July, but the occupancy of restaurants declined 4.8%, statistics show.
Peter Martin, CGA consultant, who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of England's good weather and career in the Football World Cup, longer than expected, led to the pattern of June, in which the pubs recorded a 2.8% growth, but with a rebound in sales, they reopened in July.
The 1.8% drop in restoration sales in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the beverage-based business had by far the best performance, with a similar growth that more than offsets the decline of restaurants.
The pubs with the meal-based business also faced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the restoration operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In directly managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6% over the month, with meals dropping 3%.
Paul Newman, analyst for the RSM recreation and restoration sectors, said: “These results extend the trend we’ve been recording since the end of April.
Meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors influencing the market’s sales of out-of-home food.
It is no surprise that the restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is especially damaging when added to the prolongation of cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not come at a worse time for operators with the business based on meals. Only the weather will tell if the mildest temperatures we know in August will provide such desired relief."
The growth in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launch.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of the sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, being recognized as the industry benchmark.
One in five children hide secret accounts from their parents on social media
One in five children - some just 11 years old - have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, a study revealed.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of “fake” pages on Instagram
News aggravates fears about publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children – some just 11 years old – create accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake” accounts on Instagram’s photo-sharing site.
The news aggravated fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they had an innocuous “principal” account to show to their parents, while also holding private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found that the teenage girl was encouraging others to “violete her.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors Conference (HMC), revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers feel tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the annual General Assembly of the regulator.
President Ian Beattie described the nomination as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have a lot to do with their presence on the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be able to act as the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute to help guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter run at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, stopped running after suffering a transient vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: “It’s been a month since I’ve had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would say if it could recover and to what extent.
It has been a difficult job but I have achieved a total recovery, I have re-learned walking and I already do agility exercises!
Thank you for your message of encouragement!”
Milk extraction pump ad compares mothers to cows, sharing online reviews
A dairy pump company shared the opinions online with an ad that compares mothers who are breastfeeding cows in the herd.
To mark the release of what is described as the “first portable silent milk extraction pump,” consumer technology company Elvie released an ironic ad inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom conferred by the new pump to milk-extracting mothers.
Four mothers dance in an empty hollow to the sound of a song that includes verses like, “Yes, I’m ordering myself but I don’t have a tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, I don’t have tits, these are my breasts.”
The saying goes, "Bomb, bob, baby food, bob, bob, I'm ordering my girls."
However, the ad posted on the company’s Facebook page generated controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it alleviates the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a sad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only that their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born,” a spectator wrote.

Another commented: “It is understandably traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise an extraction pump for mothers who can stay with their babies?”
Someone said, "An ad with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, as a woman who admitted to finding the song "smiling".
"I think that's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but it makes sense.
This product is great,” one of the women wrote.
Another commented, “It’s a fun ad for mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or at work) and feel like “vaccines.”
It’s not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video the group of women reveal that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the information that many women who extract milk with pumps claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, pick up their babies, and even get out of the house while extracting milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between milk-extracting women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk-extracting, while presenting in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new pump.
It wasn't the first time Elvie's bomb was a badge.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded on the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children displaced discreetly to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has peaked, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be mated.
Traditionally, most of the "patterns" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to nurse a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential patrons and other adults who integrate their family aggregates would have to register their fingerprints, with the data being shared with the authorities regulating immigration.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior employee of the Immigration and Customs Control Service, testified before Congress that the service detained dozens of people who had applied to nursing unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal background.
Nearly 80% of the patrons or members of their family aggregates are illegal in the country, many of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That’s why we’re going to continue chasing these individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, employees introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, rather than 60 days, the previous rule, according to staff at the reception centres.
Many are present by videoconferencing, not in person, to defend their application for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid will be promptly deported.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to access to violence or attempted escape, according to the staff at the hospitals and with reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as those in Tornillo, where the large dimension contributes to ignoring signs of child disturbance.
They add that the transfer of the children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma that many are already debating.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupation forces"
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees home, despite the war in the country being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they "will be treated as such".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that left millions of displaced people.
Damascus said it would continue to "run this sacred battle until we liberate all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
As for the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions for his return were secured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led refugees to stay abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to Syria’s reconstruction until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement sets "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including Al-Nusra Front fighters associated with al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, the impeachment and scandals end his presidency in advance.
In the one that would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic final of a presidency of all time"!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue from viewers.
Since 2014, nobility-time audiences have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in noble hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a strong call to people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor" program, about a cabinet chief who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
Remember once you called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he was voting for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, “Because he makes me laugh,” Scovell told me.
Chaos is worth entertaining.
Naturally, unlike television shows, stories from Washington can determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunion of immigrants, and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can give themselves.
And yet, it’s more than just being an informed citizen when we’re watching the sixth hour of an expert debate about Bob Woodward’s use of sources “with deep knowledge” in his book “Fear,” the <0x24>15,000 ostrich leather blouse from President Paul Manafort’s Posts (“a piece of clothing from the Washington Manafort,” and Daniel’s reference to the sunshine-filled Stormy).
For my part, I will never face Super Mario again the same way.
"Part of what he's done looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump's dynamic cast and the daily turns of the plot (to be antagonized with the NFL, to praise Kim-Ung.

He was not distracted by television as Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I still remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people were saying, this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right after all."

Significant external funding in the interim elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th Circle of Pennsylvania is experiencing an influx of funding, thanks to a realignment of the electoral circles that left two titles in the race for the same place.
The recent restructuring of the Pittsburgh suburban circles put Democrat Conor Lamb in the race, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb runs against another contender, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th Circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th Circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former circles unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
The race for the 17th Circle sparked a fierce dispute over the funding of the campaign between the financial arms of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the extremely disputed March extraordinary elections for the 18th congressional constituency.
This place was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to Democrats.
U.S. considers to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, retreating
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization from the management.
State Department representatives have decided to call the leaders of U.S. diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug trafficking control, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific restrictions on visas, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
With the continuation of internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three U.S. representatives discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations under cover of anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Studying the History
The next bomb to be dropped may be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller is alleged to be guiding his investigation in order to ascertain whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to attack the elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability on the part of that body, while preparing to appear again to voters and perhaps to be judged by his peers.
There are many chances and I don’t want to suggest that Mr Trump’s fall is inevitable – not even that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices we have to make from both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup d'état, as long as the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We missed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around turning points like this, where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or blocked.
The Americans are currently facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested recording the President in secret, speculating about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the Times news is wrong.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she told me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With a legacy of these, how could he not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game with the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers will receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive scoring in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, will leave them in a good position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season until the two-goal draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a trampoline for higher flights.
"It was a well-earned point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
“We tackled the game with a positive mindset and we won a point.
Maybe we could have won near the end, but globally, the draw was probably the most fair result.
They were probably better in the first part but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but with the support of the public, I am sure we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year has been very tough, with all my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training runs well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past season and achieve success.”
Women are losing sleep with fear of this savings-reform account
Despite the fact that the survey participants have a clear idea of the type of care they intend to enjoy, few people have spoken to their family members about the matter.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continued care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same topic.
“People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they’re not having this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide life insurance.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You will not be able to prepare your family for care unless you give them your wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Engage your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your continued care financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary valuation to help cover these expenses, or financing using your own savings, as long as you have these values available.
Prepare the legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care prosecutor, choosing a person you trust to supervise your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the constitution of a prosecution about your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent suffers a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“Not only are financial issues at stake, but who are the doctors?” he asked.
"What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan.”
Man targeted multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was targeted several times with air pressure when returning home after a night in the city.
The victim, at the 40-year-old home, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries were not life-threatening and the police requested witnesses.
earthquake and tsunami in indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, expecting the death toll to increase.
With the communications interrupted, the rescue workers were unable to obtain any information from the region of Donggala, a zone north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Central Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that extends over more than 300 km of coastline, in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status less than one province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Sulawesi Central province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but mainly concentrates on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Earthquake Fire Ring, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, derailing a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died buried under the debris of the buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, a 29-year-old resident of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin is detained in a pre-trial detention centre in Mat-Su, subject to a <0x24>500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent", the station reported.
Palin faces charges for three Class A crimes, which means he can be sentenced to up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B crime, punishable by a day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the denunciation of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a gun under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of smearing her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran associations after associating her child’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died as a result of an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks were cut, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake hit the Sulawesi Central region, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
State Department rarely demands capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The New York State Department is demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city – a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state by a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October on a cycling trail on West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, sweeping pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and inflicted "intentionally" serious injuries, according to the notification calling for the death penalty, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder at the service of organized crime, normally used by the Public Prosecutor's Office in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “considerable planning and premeditation,” the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed it as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", refers the notification.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago, the New York South Zone did not ask for the death penalty for an indictment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the sentence was changed to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit acts of espionage in favor of the Soviet Union, two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court’s documentation, Saipov, a natural of Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the accusation.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He declared himself innocent of all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s defense lawyers, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the decision.
“We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today pledged to “mobilize the popular army” during a protest at the Conservatives’ congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, while one of May's MPs suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said in a Birmingham demonstration that the UK would have “already left” if Farage were Brexit minister.
But the challenge faced by Ms May to reconcile her deeply divided correligionaries was underlined by the conservatives who defended the stay, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has been debating to maintain her commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit supporters, permanence advocates and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave committee in Solihull that he intended to "end the Plan."
Mr Bone suggested that responsibilities should have been assigned to Farage in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were the one responsible, we would have left,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan.”
Strengthening his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is totally untrue.”
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, stating to journalists: “I’m simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular with our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening.”
In a message to Ms. May, she added: “Only the prime ministers who know how to keep their promises keep their jobs.”
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should “feel pressure” if they rush to betray the decision to leave the 2016 referendum.
“This has become a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them they’re not going to get out of it.”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to pressure our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
“We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city center.
A crowd of activists slammed the banner with the message “Conservatives against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
The Labour representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with an application of the party at the opening of the congress.
"It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology ready for 'More Canada', for the friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete joke.
There is no good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren Plans to 'Seriously Consider' Possible Presidential Candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously weigh the presidential nomination” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican MP Geoff Diehl, co-mandator of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that he could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump’s takeover.
One of the participants asked him if he was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it’s time “women go to Washington to fix our government’s problems and that includes a woman at the top.”
Detention in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police on Saturday announced the arrest of a suspect in the case of the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
Sims, 20, was shot down near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot in the head, after which he ended up dying," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wayde defended a friend and was targeted by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted his presence on the site, punching a gun, recognizing that he had targeted Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police squad.
Sims, a 1.98-metre junior created at Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was titled 10 times last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind by defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first at the boxing and made Hamilton have to face the end of the peloton traffic, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes went to the boxing a lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton surpassed him after a blurred squad, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the track free, at risk of disqualification after a double track correction to defend himself in the third lap.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, switching tyres too late, which would allow him to be quick in the final, aiming to beat Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He finished boxing in the 44th lap but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, allowing Raikkonen to finish fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me get over it.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions,” Hamilton said.
Poor body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a hearing on Saturday due to her insistence that she had not revealed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a hearing in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Justice Commission, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “more, more malicious and false.”
“See the beautiful thing that’s happening in the Senate these last few days, see the anger, see how bad, malicious and fake people are,” Trump said.
“When we see the leaks and the communications and when they say ‘oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you run away?
Do you remember her answer-- did you disclose the document? - 'Oh, what, what?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't leave me."
Well, wait there.
“The escape came from us... No, it wasn’t us,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the flight occurred in early September, but denied the flight had left his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t reveal his story,” Feinstein told the Commission.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented during the Saturday night rally: "You know what else, that was very bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the nominee to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that Democrats would use the charges in their favor.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
We see evil, evil, no matter who can hit, who has to step up to take power and control,” the president said.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat the Belfast Giants by 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from Friday's defeat in the First Division game against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand by 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants scored an initial two-goal lead with finishes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie embarked on the home team before Dwyer re-placed the Giants.
François Bouchard scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald’s two goals guaranteed the team’s victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had made a turn on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee by 2-1.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giants defeating the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal emerged in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the lead four minutes later.
In a first frenetic period, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided Cownie with the draw at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants reached the first interval in the lead, scoring their second night goal at the end of the first period.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard scored again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, guaranteeing victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, will receive Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape from earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has been hailed as a hero after his death by ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many remain missing after a strong earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to suffocate the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post as the control tower blossomed violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained concentrated to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the track, landed safely.
He then jumped from the control tower, facing the eminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television channel ABC News reported.
We sent a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to evacuate him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We were devastated by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, noting the country’s disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried by the rubble that we have not yet managed to rescue,” Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are carrying aid and maintenance to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
Lack of drinking water.
Minimarkets are being plundered all over the place.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesia’s Red Cross is in a race against time to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces on the site and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini now reports a missing man after plane crash in lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that unloaded in a lagoon in the Micronesia Pacific, now reports that there is a missing man after reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the plane to sink.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that, since Saturday afternoon, it could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The area company said it was collaborating with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for disclosure of more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane landed in the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
It is not yet known exactly what caused the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in claiming that the plane failed to reach the track and fell in love with the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had left the tracks.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming too low.
“It was the best thing that happened,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other people had managed to drag themselves with the water through the waist and reach the emergency exits of the plane sinking.
He said that the onboard assistants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working on an improvement work on a nearby mud also helped in the rescue by resorting to an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sinks at 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline crashes, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday in a new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to reconstitute the movements of 20-year-old archbishop Quintom Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from various phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had made earlier.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by affirming that he was in his truck that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the truck was in Nashville.
Another incongruence in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
The cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett claimed that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis erased Chambers' SMS messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"You paid her for your life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin filing its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to begin being reviewed by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling your music with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed group claims that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to return to these roots and restore popularity to conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent rebirth in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York lover sues couple for firing via "racist" SMS
A New York midwife is prosecuting a couple for discriminatory dismissal after they have mistakenly received a text message from their mother complaining that she was "another black woman."
The couple denied the allegations of racism, claiming that the trial was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed some fear when she discovered that the new lover Giselle Maurice was black when she introduced herself for her first working day in 2016.
"I can't believe... no more a black woman," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she was spotted from her gaze, a "shout" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the poor performance of the former African-American mistress and who was expecting a Filipino mistress.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only working day and sent home to Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is prosecuting the couple and requesting a dismissal compensation of <0x24>350/day relative to the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
"I want to show them that they cannot be impuned," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical since they feared they could not trust her after being offended.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t actually want to say.
He's not racist.
We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would your children trust someone who had treated them badly, even by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe it."
Calling the process of "extortion," Plasco said his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
“Are you going to chase someone like that?
It’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the legal process progresses, the court of public opinion was quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Editors Fear Readers Could Not Identify a Speaking Bear
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: “It’s hard to get into the skin of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very fun to know this now, after Paddington has been so successful.”
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a little bear to play to write the children’s book, would not have taken it to heart if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication had a bitter taste given his past year’s speech.
About Paddington, who described him as "a very important member of our family," he said his father was very proud of the success he had achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to the Gabarolice," he said.
"But as Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we're proud even when the fact isn't ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being a product of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on my phone
Shortly after landing, the daughter had been taken emergencyly to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
“Nad called often to say that the situation was really bad and there was no chance of survival,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“So Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
He said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications that doctors had given him to keep the heart functioning were slowly stopping and getting out of his system.
He had died a while ago and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stop myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other alien passengers to the test that she was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
“I’ve always had a low head.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a great deal of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.”
Lamented Women Put Cards on Bridge to Prevent Suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide struggle to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, Sharon Davis's son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any father to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Sharon Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said the son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said he was lighting the room.”
However, he quit his job before he died because he had "dipped in the dark".
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible repercussions."
Sharon Davis created the posters “so that they know there are people who are available to help and with whom they can talk, not even being a friend.
Don't lock yourself in. You have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, a longtime friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after the death of her sister-in-law.
“I didn’t say I was sad or depressed,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, there was a trap. When the kids opened the presents, you didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Destroy a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to continue to live and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake with the start of FBI investigation
"I thought that in terms of what I asked for - an investigation with time and scope defined - we could be more united," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, advancing that he feared the commission would "destroy" in the face of a rooted partisan impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is a mere temporary matter.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, Republicans have poor results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the Supreme Court frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted senators to push them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the vote of dismissal and confirm his seat in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of deserters decreases during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean deserters for North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un’s rise to power seven years ago.
Citing data from the Ministry of Unification of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1,127 desertions occurred last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the more stringent border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that people smugglers ask for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public statements.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean deserters.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants and non-refugees, and it is frequent to repatriate them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are in an impasse.
The talks took place after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general, to collaborate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, a minority leader in the House, said Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temperamentally inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse allegations to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
Kavanaugh made an emotional opening statement, sometimes in a strident and reluctant voice, when talking about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly accused the commission’s Democrats, calling the allegations made against him “a grotesque and conspiratorial assassination” organized by liberals angry by Hillary Clinton to have lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proves he has no conditions to serve in the Supreme Court given his prejudiced behavior against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats,” he said.
When asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's effective appointment and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“What I can say is that lying to Congress or the FBI doesn’t meet the conditions for being in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in its current court,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge in the D.C. Circuit Relationship Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he feared potential Kavanaugh’s views against the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs. Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions about the possibility of revoking certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced for the Supreme Court and hope that we will be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to control emotions.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and it can’t unravel without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
A woman with an executive position in any company helped me immensely. She told me that she was also crying when she got angry, but she had created a technique. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it continued.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly well that, in an old job in an office dominated by men in which I was crying with inexpressible rage, being held by the necks of an older woman—a nothing-friendly manager who scared me a little bit—and literally dragged down the stairs to hear her say it.
"Never let them see you crying."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy they’ve managed to hurt you.”
Patricia Schroeder, at the time Democratic Congresswoman of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential nomination.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship aboard a boat called Monkey Business and quit applying, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder didn’t see why she couldn’t run for president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he said laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone calling the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given its late entry, the fundraising was less than desirable and swore that it would only enter the race if it managed to raise <0x24>2 million.
A battle condemned to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him <0x24>250, although they had given <0x24>1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When she announced that she was not going to enter a formal campaign, the emotions came to the fore – gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and bring the message to voters, instead of delegates, and anger against sexism – and the tears surge.
“It even seemed like I was depressed,” Patricia Schroeder recalled when talking about the media’s reaction.
“I would have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you write in my epitaph?
"She was crying?"
How the trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The first salvage of the trade war between the U.S. and China was deaf, and although the end of the conflict is not seen, from the perspective of experts, the departure of the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese imports that include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week was the scene of a significant aggravation of the situation with the new tariffs affecting goods worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing in reality half of all goods sent by China to the U.S.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 to 10 percent for U.S. goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has pledged to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will grow in the near future.
Making Washington back would mean succumbing to demands, but showing public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its trunks, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. can positively sustain China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In fact, the fact that a timeless political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to the study from Asia at the Center for New American Security, a reflection group.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is Ready for the Return of Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country’s conditions are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have left due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly receive aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or help from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the vicinity of Paris, France.
The U.S. now accumulates six consecutive defeats in European soil since the last time they won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is again crowned victorious after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
