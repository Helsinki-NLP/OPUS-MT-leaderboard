In my view, the literature program was formed by ladies of the Balzac age based on their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century we preferred Daniel and Volkonsky.
They wrote Belletristics, of course, from the point of view of the very women of the Balzac age.
And the psychology and torture of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev for teenagers is not so interesting.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Model "Micropack Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different hardness of the sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by latexed coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft – natural latex plate.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "gamack" effect.
Among the advantages of the model is to highlight breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for air permeability, is perfectly ventilated in a natural way, like coconut shell.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping place is maintained.
There is also an extended warranty period for the mattress.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact the service life of the mattress is longer.
Dust and pollution protection is applied to a removable case made of jacquard supplied in the kit.
Buy an orthopedic pillow in pair with a mattress – it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the appointment of the sides – coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

I remember with horror these chairs and the guests at the parents' house.
Guests on the threshold, and on the plate are still cobbled up, the mother inclined to house the floor.
Oh, my God, he's already sitting at the table with no strength.
And then wash the dishes, remove the house.

What about the guests?
They're fine, even the cakes must be with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays, guests.

And I cook them spices, baking very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth Coronavirus Vaccine Inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with a new force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will probably not be enough for full protection.
This is convinced by the head of the Association of General Practice Physicians Ulrich Weigoldt.
This is reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
“We expect that the fourth vaccination will be needed in the summer, at the latest in the fall,” the expert said.
In addition, Wygeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be carried out "in combination with influenza vaccination".
This will help you achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help fight the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron".
And the new version is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than with Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer found that at two doses of the vaccine the efficacy was significantly lower: “the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.”
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron strain infection," said BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of shortening the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Furthermore, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an effect on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“Israel’s experience shows this very convincingly,” the expert stressed.
Vobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21<0xC2><0xAE>.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created with the use for sub-ice fishing, not just for catching bubbles.
These vibrations have a greater weight than those of close analogues in size, which undoubtedly positively affects the nuances of the application of these interesting antics.
Another recognizable feature is the upper float made of durable and resilient plastic, creating additional vibration shades with vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when caught against Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the thumbnail up and down almost without pauses.
When planning the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when catching in a limited space, blocked by underwater vegetation, roots and other obstacles for which it is possible to pull.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when catching a winter squirrel and a large squirrel, and especially in the middle of winter, when a punctual and aggressive supply of squirrels is required.
After reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly spins and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is not less successful for winter fishing.
To satisfy its caprice, you can choose from two modifications: with or without the NanoSound (NS) sound capsule (SL) silent.
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib play in relapse is able to irritate a passive sting that does not even react to the nerve.
When hunting, the Bet-A-Vib jumper shows range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not caprice, it is well combined with wood and knitted ropes even of large diameters.
For the catch, the squirrel, the squirrel, the fox or the dwarf is evenly relevant and "step", sometimes with a "squirrel" at the bottom.
If you catch in crowded places, you can change the front triangle to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of draws.
Among the predators of its Bet-A-Vib class is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchable.
It can be used with the same success in both relatively small and relatively deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

7,000 Russian mercenaries have been declared in Libya
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries in Libya of the private military company Vagner.
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the President of the Supreme State Council of the Republic of Khaled al-Misri.
"There are currently more than 7,000 mercenaries of Vagner CPC in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also produce tranches in Sirte and Kufr.
They have 30 jets at the airbase of Gardabia (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte), "- says the agency Anadolu.
Khaled al-Mishri also said Russian mercenaries were “trying to capture” the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after “bringing their people to power” in the Central African Republic.
Save the Presence
According to the interviewer, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located in Libya".
Vagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and a port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufa, the agency said in a statement.
The Russian authorities have officially denied that the Vagner Kremlin has been supported.
Where can there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Vagner is believed to operate in nine countries in Africa - the CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training of the local forces, personal protection of the leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Vagner’s subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of mineral and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries,” the article said.
According to the media, the "Wagners" allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is neither in the military nor in the registry of the judiciary, and its fighters are absent from the formal lists of staff.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Earlier, the 27 countries of the EU approved restrictions against Vagner.
This decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
Libya’s Supreme Council of State is de facto the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions with the predominant Islamists in it, TASS writes.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting in the elections of MPs and heads of state from December 24 to February 2022 at least.
“There is less than two weeks left before the election, and the chances of it going on in time are rapidly diminishing,” the report said.
Against this background, the Libyan Supreme Electoral Commission has postponed for an indefinite period the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign Policy in the Eyes of the Russians
38% of Russians see more success in the country’s foreign policy than failure, 29% believe that failure prevails.
"The examples of success - "in Syria defended, restored the world there," "the decision on the North Stream 2", "the whole world frightened that cool weapons," "Crime we regretted."
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world," the study of the Public Opinion Foundation says.
The Government of Dubai has completely abandoned paper production – all government services have become digital as well.
The Government of Dubai has reported a complete rejection of paper production and the transition to digital technology.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirate information agency WAM.
“Today marked the beginning of a new digitalization phase of all aspects of Dubai’s life – we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government,” said the Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Board of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed.
The internal and external document circulations in all Dubai state institutions will now be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected everything without exception the industry: health care, HR, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. The initiative of the government also joined many commercial structures.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document circulation began in Dubai since 2018.
During this time, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, amounting to 14 million hours of human labor and <0x24>353.8 million in cash equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey’s car production and exports fell below 2020 level
Turkey’s car production and exports declined sharply in November against the backdrop of depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry’s 11-month results were worse than last year’s, Bloomberg reported, referring to data from the Association of Automotive Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were released from the factories in Turkey, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
Approximately 75,9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year.
And if after the results of the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector in Turkey showed a positive trend to last year, then by the results of the 11 months of 2021 the car production was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for this decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November declined by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs have been deferred on credit payments in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov spoke about the situation on the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform".
"According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on regulation and development of the financial market, in this year in compliance with the order of the Head of State from 1 April 2021 accepted the order of the President of the Agency from 9 April 2021 "Responsibility of Proceedings of Proceedings of Proceedings".
He recalled that the procedure for granting the deferral of loan payments provided for the granting by banks and microfinance undertakings of the deferral of payments on loans issued before 1 April 2021 to entities of SMEs, including 1 April 2021.
The period of delay was from 30 to 90 days after the selection of the subject of SMEs.
The borrower’s application could have indicated a different term of payment delay.
During the period of delay with respect to the borrower, the claim-request work was suspended, the notification of the need for repayment of the late debt, as well as the borrower's collection of commissions and other payments," - the prime minister noted.
For 2021, banks of the second level have submitted applications for a delay in payments on loans of 603 SME lenders, of which 553 SME entities received a delay in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
The IFM submitted applications for a deferral of 131 subjects of the SME, of which the deferral was granted to 95 subjects of the amount of 105.8 million tenge," - concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily carry the strain "ocmyron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective response of the body.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "ocmiron" can be dangerous.
The reason is to look for in the conditions of the virus.
Scientists believe that "ocmyron" was born in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficiency sufferer.
That is, during the mutation, he did not encounter any resistance from immunity.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Because there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spikes, spikes, can be more than placed, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate ocmirone more easily than those who have a strong protective response of the body.
It turns out that the body’s strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is the case with pneumococcal infections, when a 30-year-old dies, and a 60-year-old in the form of a chiche bears it.
The immune response is angry with the young man, he is completely inadequate: where it was possible to only threaten with a finger, he hits like a gun on the prey, - concluded Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to cure only the symptoms - all the hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - it is temperature, weakness, discomfort.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, coughing in the throat, coughing.
Pain to the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
In the meantime, in Russia until the end of the year, the growing generation can begin to vaccinate from 12 to 18 years old.
The virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of MFTI Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from covid.
In teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts is as high as possible.
It is the most socially active layer, as well as the kindergarten teachers, - said "Moscow 24" Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the IFTI genomic engineering laboratory.

Immunologists have hypothesized why people with obesity become victims of covid
The authors studied the fat tissue left by bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells known as adipocytes could be infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in fatty tissue, macrophages, have also been infected, showing a strong inflammatory reaction.
The researchers also examined the fat tissue of patients who died from covid and found the coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding the various organs.
HIV and influenza viruses are known to hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid immune system response.
SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of this.
The biologist explains the causes of dementia
Biological sciences candidate Semen Golosheykin named the causes of dementia and talked about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
Syndrome manifests a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person with difficulty is oriented even in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a deficiency of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of such factors as social isolation and the lack of active cognitive activity is possible,” he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders, and an immobile lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the occurrence of the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical exercise, training the cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.

Egypt returns about 30,000 illegally exported artifacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return some 30,000 artifacts that have been illegally exported from the country by smuggling.
Al-Hayat, head inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, reported on Saturday, 11 December.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has recovered 29,300 artifacts.
“Only this year in the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered,” he said.
Abdel Gaud clarified that all the artifacts exported by smuggling were recorded in the archives.
The Department is currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts “track auctions around the world and online sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that upon return, cultural values are restored, and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was found in Belgium an ancient human skeleton, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
Christie's auction house on July 4 held auctions on which busts aged more than 3,000 years were sold for <0x24>5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Ammon, was kept in a private collection and has not been auctioned since 1985.
How the relics arrived in Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking repatriation of illegally expulsed monuments from the country at different times.
According to authorities, 95% of smuggling antiquities are the result of archaeological searches of "black excavators".
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazanians) live in the Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkish language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees’ personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communications devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under the current rules, a bank may view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to deal with business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank exercises the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases – for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client that has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote working mode, the bank wants to spread this rule to all devices that have been used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set the deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
There is no official comment on the new requirement in Credit Suisse.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the earthly being of the poet and his "ego".
He is already out of any literary associations, he is distracted by imagery, he is in himself, but is well-known, demanding, sometimes strongly criticized by critics, even evil, but the reader is ready to carry it on his hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them - real masterpieces, completed the cycle "Persian motifs", written the poem "Anna Snegina", published 8 books, a collection "Russian Soviet".
And the main success - at the end of June 25 of the year, the State signed with Esseni a contract for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the modern poets Sergei Aleksandrovich received such honor, he was the first!
In addition, it was very good money - according to the contract the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles. per month, the engineer - 200).
The funds were needed in that year as never before.
Esenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy Sophie Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange the family life, to hold the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
It looks like life is set, there is something to be happy about, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark tones, as if a nightmare materialized from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Essenin):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is the wind whispering
In a deserted and uninhabited land,
As I grow up in September,
It inflates the brain with alcohol.
Many acquaintances have noted that Essenin gave up heavily, looks bad, clearly ill.
There are more and more recurrences of throbbing, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, probably, is not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergei Aleksandrovich was put on someone, there are no credible documents left.
Let's say those relating to May 1923, when Esenin, on the insistence of his fourth wife, the Americans Isadora Duncan improved health at the clinic under Paris with Professor Peter Hannushkin (Esenin will come to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But here's the evidence of the poet's praises, the scandals on this ground, the drives to the militia are enough - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the fearsome novel of a poet with a green snake has evolved rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin settled for a short time with a friend, the imager Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, with his very good income, Esenin never had his home in Moscow or in Peter, he found himself in removable apartments, in hotels or in acquaintances.
The Elders remember:
“I only came overnight, and in most cases in an impenetrable, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Esenin fell on the staircase...
He fell, shaved his face and snorted.
After a while, he began to cough continuously, sprinkling the whole bed with blood...”
Yes, and Essenin himself, after a warrior in Europe and the United States (in the United States there was a dry law at the time, but Duncan took with him a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there except the cabbages and the street...
I'm done and people don't remember...
Well, and drinking, of course...
And I drank because the toast was rotten.”

Poland’s foreign minister believes Belarus is using migrants as “weapons” against the EU
Poland’s Foreign Ministry Says Belarus Uses Migrants as “Weapon”
Poland’s Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Yablonsky has expressed the view that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intends to return to such an “operation” next year.
The Deputy Foreign Minister’s statement was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus "temporarily stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new ways".
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons "in many parts of the world".
According to the website kp.ru, the European Union had previously put in place a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they said they were willing to continue to extend restrictive measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a broad list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by the Hat Snake": when a barhat jacket makes a man ridiculous
At the world events of 2021, barhat jackets were dominated.
Perhaps the first person to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
In September, on the premiere of the film "Not Time to Die", he appeared in a barhat raspberry jacket and a traditional "bond" butterfly.
Following his example twice, Prince William, who first assigned to the The Earthshot Prize for an eco-premium ceremony an unsuitable royal dress code green beard jacket, and then chose a more classic version for the event in support of the Royal Charity.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend proved itself and Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh "Golden Ball" in the Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already noting the growing demand for men’s jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, who entered the "Gazeta.Ru", they started to buy them 1.4 times more often.
The most popular warm berth jackets with a lining and a silhouette, the main colors - dark-beige, embroidery, dark-blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models - from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - kits of berth suits they choose less.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, the bargain jackets of this season are featured in almost all brands - both Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which came out for one of the premieres of the film "Home Gucci" brand ambassador Jared Leto.
Choosing expensive branded jackets, you can be sure that the barhat is made of silk.
Thanks to the special yarn weaving technology, a dense fabric with a velvety outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but and, accordingly, serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Wakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not his model or fashion, but suitability.
“The bargain requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you’re going to a party or a festive event,” explains Wahoshkin. “It’s also suitable if the dress code “Black Tie” or “Creative Black Tie” is indicated in the invitation.
Another important criterion, the compliance of which allows you to make a choice in favor of a berthed jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should be equipped with the right advanced hike with enough," believe the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Beautiful Brammell". - The owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the people.
They are simply invited to secular events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Wahoshkin proposes to combine a jacket from the bar with the same suits: classic pants with arrows, single-coloured shirts, silk ties, loppers with brushes, ties.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from "Beautiful Brammell" are confident: it will also be inappropriate to appear in the barhat jacket of a regular employee at the corporation, but if it is about a "manager among those who manage this event, then - "yes" to those who know it.
If the employee ranks lower, and his goal is to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to kick out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a barge jacket.
The guide will accurately evaluate this by the phrase "not by the Snake of the Hat", - think the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous sensations from the voice.
It's an unnatural temp, it's so exhausting.

It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbyed, that is, paid off.

Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy is also not in stock - both gas, and oil, and coal bought cheaper than they are now sold.
Wild demand for fuel.

Who's on the flight then?

I didn’t see a single beautiful person in the photos in the article.
It’s just the average of average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole wagon, then they will not be able to do so, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such “beautiful” people, but not precisely because of their appearance.

Immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of the coronavirus "omicron"
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron".
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccine six months later, given the emergence of a new strain, "a very large period"
“For previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases in four,” the expert said, calling in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to do the revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person has been given two vaccines and a booster, or he has been over-vaccinated, or vaccinated and over-diseased, then he has been given a ‘hybrid immunity’, that is, antibodies many and neutralizing enough,” the expert said.
"Big Seven" warns Russia about "large-scale consequences" in case of invasion of Ukraine
The countries of the Great Seven (UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of the Heads of Foreign Affairs in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia’s “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow expensively”, but the specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's growing military power and aggressive rhetoric," he said.
The ministers further call on Russia “to weaken the escalation, to use diplomatic channels and to comply with its international commitments regarding the transparency of military activity,” as U.S. President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the foreign ministers said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
“Russia must not doubt that the further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response,” they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome the conservative position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation in terms of our overall and comprehensive response," the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Trass, said that Russia would be subjected to “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting showed “one vote of the Big Seven countries, which account for 50% of the world’s GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia.”
Pfizer vaccine is 32 times less effective than omicron strain
The efficacy of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower than other types of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on an antiviral activity study in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
“We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against omicron variety,” said Professor Malik Pairis.
At the same time, the researchers stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way of protecting against the severe course of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic due to the impact of the Omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if no additional measures were taken.
The head of the defense ministry of Ukraine accuses the Russian Federation of blocking NATO arms supplies to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition of lethal weapons by Kiev within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov reminded that last month Germany imposed a veto on Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifle to defeat drones.
At the same time, it is noted that Berlin later softened its position on guns, recognizing them as a non-lethal weapon.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons in the framework of bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, it concerns the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholtz on the permit of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the ambassador of Ukraine to Germany, Andrei Melnik, expressed the view that Kiev should not be expected from Berlin for arms supplies with Chancellor Sholce.
According to him, the previous German leadership explained its refusal to provide weapons with the risk of a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the “Russia occupation” of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, will be maintained by Germany with the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in the equipment of the navy.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chair of the “green” party of the Federal Republican Party, Robert Habek, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

G7 Warns Russia of Responsibility for Invasion of Ukraine
The G7 foreign ministers warned of “serious consequences” for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, the parties’ final statement said.
Participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
“Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs,” the statement said on the UK government’s website.
The ministers of the G7 countries and the EU's top representative noted that "they are united in their condemnation of Russia's armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine".
Britain’s Foreign Minister Elizabeth Trass warned at a press conference in Liverpool about “greater consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to give up its aggression against Ukraine,” she said.
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the growth of Russian troops at the border with Ukraine, the parties must return to the negotiating table.
It was about negotiations in the Normandy format.
The North Atlantic Alliance was also in favour of dialogue on Ukraine in the "Norman format".
Russian Foreign Minister Maria Zakharova said that, calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "were unable to take responsibility for their own mistakes".

Ways to Recover Money Stolen via Online Stores
There are several ways to return money stolen through online stores and not to become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of major losses when entering bank card data into the hands of the attackers, it is recommended to store the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
Part of the accumulations can be postponed to a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend creating a separate card for online purchases.
If money has been stolen from purchases in stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, you can start the refund procedure.
“In the framework of the rules established by payment systems for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility is placed on the participant in the settlement chain who does not use this service,” - said a spokesman of Promsvizbank.
Expert from international payment provider Ecompay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to apply to the bank for a dispute over the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be contested and refunded.
It should be noted that in some cases online stores themselves return the funds to the customer, if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the House of Commons, Ekaterina Mizulina, director of the Safe Internet League, said that only in 2021, 11,000 requests for various cases of fraud were received: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under current circumstances could be to create a single window for online fraudsters’ complaints.
Scholtz arrived in Poland to discuss "Northern Stream-2" and EU legislation
The newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz has arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the growth of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with Russia.
Although Scholtz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Moravecki said he would call on Sholz to oppose the "Northern Stream 2", which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany to circumvent Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland’s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has said it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving the crisis.
Poland’s judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the disagreement.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, stating that judicial reforms undertaken by the right-wing party “Justice and Law” violate EU law.
Poland has refused to pay a fine, and its Supreme Court has ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new German government, which was sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to stop the work of the “Northern Stream 2” in the event of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they had reached an agreement with Germany on stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. Congress official said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholtz warned on Wednesday about the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the "Big Seven".

The money found in the wall of the church sanitary equipment will be paid <0x24>20,000
A Santtechnician, who found money in a church wall in the U.S. state of Texas, will be rewarded.
This is reported in a press release by the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in the large evangelical church of Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians await wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, sanitary technician Justin Cowley repaired one of the church toilets and discovered under thermal insulation thousands of packets of money and cheques.
He handed over the find of the church and, according to him, did not even receive gratitude from Austin.
“I wanted to hear him say, ‘You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you have done and what you could have done,” KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
Apparently, the discovery is related to the theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
There were about <0x24>200,000 in cash and <0x24>400,000 in checks that were stored in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, for information about the criminals, they announced a reward of <0x24>25,000.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount, as the prize has already expired.
Despite this, the nonprofit Crime Stoppers of Houston, at the time allocating <0x24>5,000 to the prize and later receiving another <0x24>20,000 as a gift from the Church of Lakewood, decided to reward the honesty of the sanitary system.
He'll get <0x24>20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of the Church of Lakewood.
Tanya, her statements, her actions are her characteristic of "as a real person".
Therefore, the attitude towards her is so negative.
And it’s not that “it’s financially significantly richer than all the letters,” as it’s written here.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves as rudely, as provocatively as this lady.

In Brazil, they were obliged to demand from those entering the territory of a covid passport state, the relevant decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Robert Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from the presentation of the certificate of vaccination.
Also included in the list of exceptions are persons coming from countries where the absence of the vaccine has been proven.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year’s, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other activities, which implies an increase in the tour flow,” Barroso said.
Previously, Brazil’s authorities obliged tourists not vaccinated against the coronavirus to comply with a five-day quarantine.
Unveiled full protection scheme against COVID-19
A virologist, a doctor of medical sciences, deserved Russian scientist Anatoly Altstein in a conversation with Ura.ru unveiled a complete scheme of protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and using the nasal vaccine.
When used internally, a large amount of immunoglobulin A is formed. When the vaccine is administered by injection, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you inject both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is still no decision on double vaccination,” the doctor said.
The chief prophylacticist of UrFO, doctor of medical sciences Sergei Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help in that in that case, the protection of the body is supposed to be the maximum.
Previously, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseynov, said that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, it is this picture that is seen in other countries, where another wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, um...
I talked to the cable (deceased a long time ago) like this - if you're ready to change the warm house, the feeder, the grace, the love and the game for the fluffy bitch, then go ahead.
But the sand was trained and clever at all.
I chose my company and went home.
The video is a way that works in 90% of cases.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I hampered many owners not to run after the dog, even though they assumed that there were 200,000 (German) running away, took my hand and took it to the other side.
In the end, "200,000" chose the host, not the dog that ran somewhere.
Mass Protests Against Vaccination Don’t Stop in Europe
More than 40,000 protesters took to the streets in the Austrian capital, Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans by the authorities to make vaccination against Covid compulsory.
As of February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held in their hands posters with the inscription "It's a fake pandemic," "I won't be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the Covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, homes of the elderly and night entertainment establishments.
The decision on the introduction of sanitary passports by the authorities in a number of regions of the country has been taken against the background of the increasing number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The campaign began peacefully, but then grew into clashes with the guards of the order.
A group of protesters began to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officials used watermelons.
Nicholas S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.

WHO has discovered “omicron” already in six dozen states
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the new strain of the coronavirus “omicron” has already been identified in 63 countries.
Some experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have disastrous consequences.
The rate of dissemination of the strain was reported by the WHO.
As of December 9, the strain has been identified in 63 countries, in all six regions of the WHO.
This is because it has only been actively spreading since the end of November.
WHO also expressed concern at the high rate of the spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts have expressed concern that the new strain could bypass the prevalence of the delta strain, the same Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all countries absolutely without exception.
Tedros Adhan Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, said the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions have also been reached in the UK.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the omicron will push the delta out in the coming months.
And the number of sick people in the UK alone will be about 1 million. This is with the fact that the official "omicron" at the moment in the Kingdom several hundred people are sick, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the Omicron strain, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals on a daily basis.
What the British health system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain is 32 times lower than other types of the disease.
About how the Russian "Sputnik V" reacts to the "omicron" is not yet known - it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The name center Gamalei has only begun testing the Russian vaccine on the strain "omicron".

Russians warn of new scheme of fraudsters
The hackers have started looking for new maneuvers for fraud in video messaging.
This is what Izvestia writes with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon product director Zaura Abutalimova, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communications means is diphtheics.
In this case, the scammers create a fake video based on real-life recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this, neuroses are able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of one person or another.
Abutalimov added that using a dipfeek, the attackers can call the victims familiar on video communication or create a video with a copy of the person involved for mailing for the purpose of blackmail.
“Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, as an undercover attacker can place people in absurd, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenes,” the expert said.
Varonis Vetkol, a leading system engineer, noted that psychological people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to video-based technologies.

Here are five actions that will help prevent diabetes mellitus.
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
Some, however, do not give much importance to it, and see.
Diabetes mellitus can lead to severe complications and even death over time.
Preventive activities play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regimen - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to conventional water positively affects metabolism.
Sweet foods increase blood sugar levels to a dangerous indicator when consumed in excess amounts.
Therefore, the first step on the path to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The occurrence of the disease is affected not only by incorrect nutrition, but also habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise to adhere to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but will also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Food fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to the appearance of a sense of satiety, secretion of digestive juices and increased food absorption.

Dr. Pavlova told about "weekend migraines" in workers
Deterioration in health over the weekend can lead to several factors.
The cause of deterioration of well-being after workdays is often "weekend-day migraine," said a well-known endocrinologist, a candidate in medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of MGU, the scientific director of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine.
According to her, this is especially common among workers who suffer from headaches, discomfort and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue for the week there are enough objective causes of the body’s negative reaction to the change of conditions.
During the weekend, our lives change radically.
“We sleep for a long time, we lie on the couch all day, we probably eat more and drink less,” the doctor argued.
Due to overeating and lack of water - gravity and fragmentation."
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in deteriorating well-being, Pavlova recommended that you track what changes most during the weekend.

South African Scientists Say Low Efficiency of Pfizer Vaccine Against Omicron
In South Africa declared low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
Scientists from the South African Republic conducted a study and reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of the "omicron") corresponds (the level) of the vaccine's effectiveness in 22.5% against infection with symptoms, due to which... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is questioned, - says the text of the study published on Medvxi.
At the same time, the specialists clarified that the drug can save from the severe course of the disease.
Earlier at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Omicron strain of the coronavirus could trigger a new wave of pandemic with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much sugar is hidden in conventional foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under the unknown word in the composition of the product can be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie, composition and glycemic index.
On the label can be presented several dozen names, essentially denoting sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other saturated sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), leulose (fruit sugar), melassa (black duck), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctoral sausage, bread, etc.
As stated in Roskachevo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as pay attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
The different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the ingredient in the composition of the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be considerably higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholtz: Gas will lose importance to Germany in 25 years
German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz said that gas imports are losing importance to Germany as the country continues to decarbonize the economy.
According to him, by 2045, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate-neutral country.
“In 25 years, the world will be such that the issue of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role,” the chancellor said.
Scholts noted that Germany continues to maintain its commitment to Ukraine’s transportation of Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement that recorded Berlin’s support for the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annanna Berbock said that the process of certification of the North Stream 2 gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, in the framework of the coalition negotiations and negotiations of the coalition treaty, it was stated that energy projects should apply European energy law.
The diplomat also said that the pipeline "does not comply with the regulations" of the European Union.

Hackers hacked India's Prime Minister's Twitter
Hackers hacked India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Twitter account.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal means of payment, as well as that the country had already purchased cryptocurrency.
In the Modi office they were asked to ignore new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter quickly reacted - access to the account was restored.
India’s prime minister’s country was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to be made to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a New Caledonian referendum, the majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted against the independence of their territory during the referendum.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, New Caledonia's independence from France was 3.51% (2,755 people) of the voters, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "no".
The number was 43.90%, in total, more than 80,000 New Caledonian residents participated in the elections.
As France-Presse comments on the interim results, “the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt” as independence supporters urged voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed it on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full and "honest" election campaign.
This non-participation thus paved the way for the third victory of the French New Caledonian supporters, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
As the separatists said, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Palace of Elisée, French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to speak on the outcome of this referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia’s independence has largely revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have expressed their support for the territory to remain in France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must remain French," said Erik Zemmour on several occasions.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecheress, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
Emmanuel Macron, for his part, announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it’s not his responsibility.”
However, the president added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia.”
Prime Minister Jean-Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France."

WSJ readers criticized the article on relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell’s article in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and has made a number of offensive statements to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to “take a united front against Russia.”
The readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti comments one of the readers.
“Europe is not ours to ‘lose’ it, and Ukraine is not our land.
“The United States and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine,” he said.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near Chicotan's chicken island.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km northeast of the city of North Kurilsk.
Ochag flew to a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Peru, in which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation of reactive drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create reactive unmanned aircraft (BPLA) type ANKA.
On December 11, the independent advisor to the head of the office of the Ukrainian president Alexei Arrestovich said.
That is, they are able to act against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish aircraft: the body and the like,” - quotes his Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA devices, Arrestovich said that these are reactive, not piston UAVs.
According to him, it is the new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed him "in all its characteristics".
The first batch of BPLA should be produced by the factory at the end of next year, Arrestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish aerospace agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
Earlier, the Ukrainian General Staff secreted data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile complexes during the military operations of the United Forces in Donbass.
On December 6, the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky announced that the construction of a factory for the production of modern military drones in the country began.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence concluded an agreement on the construction in the Kyiv region of the center, in which the personnel will be trained, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish BPLs Bayraktar.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a great real step forward".
Two lions fled to the airport from the container.
The lions fled to Singapore's Changi airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions arriving on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the running lions lay on the roof of the container.
The beasts could not stay away from it because of the row of protective nets installed.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of the staff of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which runs all of Singapore’s zoos.
They demobilized the lions using drugs with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to the quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion had fled from the owner and wandered the streets of the city.
On the same day the beast voluntarily returned home, the people were not hurt.
Experts Warn of Cancer Threat due to Vitamin B9
Studies suggest that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is considerable evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less at risk of developing certain types of cancer, in particular colorectal.
However, exceeding the required dose, on the contrary, contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
A professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if it significantly deviates from this figure in the greater or lesser way.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without the advice of a doctor, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid chicks with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, contained in avocados, Fine recommended men after 50 years to eat this fruit more often.
In the UK by April, about 75,000 people may die from omicron strain
Forecasts by British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus in the UK in the next five months, up to 75,000 people may die if the restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, referring to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergency Situations at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022 at least 25,000 patients will be diagnosed in the country.
At the peak of morbidity, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected daily.
“Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to prevent the National Health Service from overloading if the omicron strain is more contagious than the delta variant, and the current vaccines will not be able to eliminate infections,” said L. Barzana mathematician L.
Earlier, the UK’s Health Safety Agency reported that if the rate of spread of omicron strains remains at its current level, around 1 million cases of infections will be detected by the end of the year.
By mid-December, omicron strains could become dominant in the UK.
Currently, 1,898 cases of omicron strain coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the last day.
On December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, said that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

Richard Cry, by the way, the thoughts you express are not very accessible to the majority.
What do you mean, those who are on instagrams are pretending, or they're doing it, because it's not worth pretending?
It's like a material leak, everything that didn't break out in its time is here.
If you set a goal and dig nicely, then you can find something tangible in the mud.
You just have to be patient and understand clearly what you are looking for.
The demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter in the world.
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year hit all the world records, despite calls to cut the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of yachts ordered was 1,200 - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of combating the effects of climate change for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress of <0xC2><0xA3>50 million or more will not decrease.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous one.
Brokers say there hasn’t been such an update on the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of contamination on the ground and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If all these people used to go to the office and meet with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are on the go.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyards are accepting orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, only if their yacht was ready at least a year or two earlier.
“People just want freedom, and the super-rich could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of lack of space travel, life on yachts or flights on their own planes are annoying in society, as the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with all the rest of humanity.
Economists call on governments to act and propose to introduce new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of super-yachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a length of feed above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-metre REV Ocean yacht.
After landing, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool", as well as a submarine, designed to study the sea depths.
On the existing super yachts are not conventional steel fields for helicopters, cinemas in the open air, and on some of them, such as on the yacht of the fighter McGregor - a platform for the fights.The professor of economic anthropology is a co-founder, a professor of economic anthropology from the American University of Rydney.
But it is symbolic, given that there are a little over 2,000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of the overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission mark of billionaires is a thousand times the mark of the average resident of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the world’s largest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail landed on his 162.5-metre-long Eclipse yacht.
Even if the yacht owner is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to take the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
The owners of the superyacht do not cause sympathy for other people when they, as Australia’s richest woman, Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that their giant ships have no room for floating.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build a marina for ships with a mass of 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol that leads to the development of bowel cancer
American scientists have determined what amount of alcohol per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts concluded that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
In addition, moderately drunk men have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
The exact cause of the development of such a type of oncology scientists cannot determine, only noting that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old
Many, and more specifically all dog lovers, are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But they don’t even guess how much four-legged pets actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have carried out various experiments to be sure how intelligent animals evolve.
Although the vocabulary of a dog is not as extensive as human, a new study shows that a dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or write poems, they have no meaning in politics, economics and arts, while they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet enough.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of their ability to learn do not subordinate to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine prepares for trade between the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will “negotiate” about Ukraine’s entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for the publication “Glavred”.
According to him, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on U.S. guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite U.S. leader Joe Biden’s words about the country’s right to “get anywhere.”
If you are offered something deliberately unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not be trading, but simply send the offerer.
And with regard to Ukraine, the auction is planned,” the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks to dialogue with Kiev.
“The preparations are carried out in secret, quickly and immediately proceed to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the group to be detected and deployed,” he noted.
China Stimulates Development of Rail Transport Industry
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transportation and Equipment Exhibition, held in Zhejiang, China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said a spokesman for the company, Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into service earlier this month, are already equipped with data technology, which will ensure increased reliability and operational capacity of the mobile team.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its rail vehicle exports, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “China’s speed.”
In May of this year, the CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd production line saw the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China designed for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the subway train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will move along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city’s airport.
Movement along this metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
“China’s railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Yaosian, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Trade/International Committee.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of China’s high-end equipment production in the world market,” said Feng Yaosian.
After more than 60 years of hard work, conducting a number of independent research and development, China has developed an advanced production system for rail transport equipment, with a full set of auxiliary equipment and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosian, the country ranks first in terms of the level of electrification of railways and in the operational run on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Biological sciences candidate Semen Golosheykin in an interview with Sputnik radio listed early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, plan, decreased levels of abstract thinking.
It is currently being discussed that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheykin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in a timely manner.
According to him, reducing the risk of developing dementia will help to learn foreign languages and active communication.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical exercise, regularly training cognitive skills with games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking.
“There are recommendations on the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and applicability are still discussed in the scientific community,” Golosheykin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical exercise, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thought,” said Golosheykin.
Earlier, a UK-based charity for dementia research said that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered vision problems, due to which the patient acquires difficulty in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing weakness has been called aphasia - a condition where a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent to treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili needs psycho-nervical treatment and rehabilitation abroad, journalists were told by neuroscientist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical council created by the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," - said the specialist, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psycho-nervical rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage medical care after prison officials subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
Georgian politics were able to quickly abolish punishment and restore themselves to former rights.

Protests against COVID passports have taken place in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, there have been protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate, according to the agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for a trip to bars, restaurants, gyms, homes for the elderly and night entertainment establishments.
Many protesters came to the action without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, a passport for vaccination will also be required for admission to entertainment establishments and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city declared a medical dictatorship, and called the vaccination an experiment.
More than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus have been identified in Spain since the pandemic, with more than 88,000 deaths.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions on unvaccinated people.
Bills on a single system of QR codes were submitted by the government to the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit the places of mass events, cultural institutions, public food facilities and retail with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a transmitted disease, or a honeycomb from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel on trains and planes.

The Great Rise: How Chinese Become Mountaineers
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help create international-level resorts in the country.
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will raise President Xi Jinping’s designated 1 trillion yuan, but also contribute to the economic development of remote provinces.
Taiwan's ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the venue of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greening works are carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task in the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become perpetual.
However, it is still a long way off.
Games advisor Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed to unrecognizable.
Every year, more and more Chinese people go to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agriculture and mining areas.
These regions still have to be actively developed and the infrastructure needed to rest there.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, not far from the venues of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was run from Beijing to Chunli, and now none of the locals suffer without work.
More and more shops are opening in the country, selling clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes open points of common food with dishes of national cuisine.
There is now even a testing station for COVID-19 in Taiwan.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should be leaders in the biggest international competitions, and resorts and equipment - to reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people in the world can be put into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has hampered humanity’s progress in universal access to health care, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In connection with the International Day for the Universal Coverage of Health Services on 12 December, WHO and the World Health Organization (WHO) have published two complementary reports.
In them, they found that the pandemic led to failures in the provision of medical services, caused excessive tension in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, population coverage has decreased by immunization, the mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) stressed that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, which made it harder for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services from their pockets.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has engulfed more than 100 million people in poverty, and more than four billion people have virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese Minister Disabled From Broadcasting at “Democracy Summit” at the request of the White House
Taiwan's digital technology minister Audrey Tan's speech at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized "Democracy Summit" was translated into video-free mode, a YouTube video of the summit shows.
Reuters, citing sources, said the image had been deactivated at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was distinguished in a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island to be its territory.
The map, shown by Ms. Tan, was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan has been identified as green as "free" and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam as red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced with a screenshot noting that the views of the participants of the discussion “do not necessarily express the position of the U.S. government.”
China was not invited to the “Democracy Summit”.
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister may have been inconsistent with the policy of “one China” that Washington holds.
One of the agency’s sources said that after demonstrating the map, the U.S. National Security Council contacted the State Department furiously, accusing him of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington Summit for Democracy was held from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” summit, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the editor-in-chief of the “New Newspaper” Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be devoted to charity.
Earlier today, the deputy secretary of the Soviet Union Yuri Averyanov said that the summit took place "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke about the "delicate withdrawal" in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestiam assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of cooperation led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but in some aspect of the prospect of improving relationships, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion as a result of the long journey we have taken with the current administration, with both Trump and Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday,” the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the U.S.’s desire to impose approaches on Russia on many issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts on the prospects of improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington’s position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there is no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and that the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow is ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
Virusologist warns about the dangers of vaccination with COVID nasal drug outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may be allergic and need medical assistance, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping malls.
This was reported by TASS virologist, member-correspondent of the RAN, the Laboratory of Bionotechnology, Microbiology and Virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergei Netesov.
Organizing nasal vaccine vaccination points at airports and shopping malls is easier, but I would do it at first only in medical facilities.
The fact is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but it is desirable that the person then sits next to the doctor’s office.
Doctors have special sets of antiallergic drugs that act literally within a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary,” Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it is possible to think about vaccination in shopping malls when experience in the use of the drug is accumulated.
He also stressed that when using the nasal vaccine, it is important that it hits the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach the destination if the person vaccinated with a nose lining swells after injection.

Sandkov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Russian President Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the territory of the country.
"What kind of restrictions to impose against Russia and not to experience suffering on its own - it is impossible," a Kremlin official said on the TV channel "Russia 1".
Sandow says it is “understood by everyone in the world.”
Earlier it was reported that the US is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions on energy as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars with respect to Russian banks and the Russian direct investment fund.
Sberbank chief Hermann Graf is sure that this is not possible.

Independence from France was supported by 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
Cancelled the results of 2.99% of the bulletin.
The voting rate on that day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the sites.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris has refused to postpone the referendum.

A referendum on independence was held in the region in 2018.
Most of the inhabitants supported the founding of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.

WHO Preliminaryly Considers “Omicron” Less Dangerous Than “Delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminary considers the omicron to be less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a reduction in vaccine efficacy in the new variant of COVID-19.
On December 9, Omicron was registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly modified antigenic profile of the Omicron strain protein suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it ("the severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than with "delta", the WHO technical report says.
The organization notes that, so far, all cases of omicron infection in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
However, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster "delta".
In Russia, two cases of omicron strain infection have been recorded.
They were “previously immunized,” the Gamalei Center said.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popov, said there is no credible evidence yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than others.

In Ukraine named four scenarios for Zelensky
The former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
In his view, the head of state could remain without the support of the West, as well as possibly compromise on the Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told about this in the publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called the "ideal storm", suggests that Ukraine will stop supporting key Western countries by reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
“In parallel, there is a decline in the prices of key commodities that we traditionally export . . . domestic protests and the opposition of power to key FPG (financial-industrial groups),” the former parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will happen in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the leadership of Ukraine may come to compromises on the Donbass, resulting in a possible confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky’s position will weaken, the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former Nardep, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of people who disagree with the Green Group and the president, which is why it is likely to take control of the power bloc and implement "popular initiatives".
In the course of such a variant of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "transforming power", Denisenko added.
Another scenario - Zelensky's transformation into the "father of the nation".
This can lead to an event that will be a great shock to society.
“The event must be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine,” Denisenko said.
Such a variant of the development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technogenic disaster or the aggressive actions of Russia, the former deputy considers.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly denied any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the US that are increasing military activity at Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from the survey of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest rate since he was elected head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the case of the next presidential election of Ukraine, they would vote for Zelensky only 21.8%, while for the country's former president Petro Poroshenko - 14.5%.
Of all the respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Arrested for action on Red Square the poet: "For the quote Yevtushenko is given 10 days, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, the 21-year-old poet Alexander Volkchenkov was arrested for ten days.
The student was detained on Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtag <0x23>PoetvrossyBig Poet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol on the administrative article on the repeated violation of the order of public action was drawn up in Alexandria.
He was detained for the first time on January 23 at Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to attract attention to poetry as a whole, now the interest in it is unfortunately lost, to the decline of the common culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," - explains Aleksan.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal the message of his message in more detail.
How did the police treat you this time and before when you were arrested?
What did you ask in the department, how did you comment on your action?
This time the staff were more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, no matter how funny it sounds in some context of the word.

They asked me about the motives.
When they hear, in principle, they look, if they do not approve, then they understand.

And if after the action under this hashtag they start writing their own poems, at least a few people, I'm not going to postpone these 10 days.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak alone, even in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events they speak in the language of the surroundings, so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in the native language through a translator.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks well in Russian and still resorts to the help of a translator.
And even at official events, a stenogram is carried out by an old author, and the stenographer is not obliged to know several languages.

Due to the high content of the pineapple, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to squeeze or boil, rather than boil on oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics as well as other high-glycemic foods.
These are carbohydrate-containing foods that quickly break down into sugar, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper Kommersant warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in its production in private households and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment will be able to replace only imports.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex
Candidates for Exit
In 2015, rights holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites of the runnet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazarian, director general of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to including a regular domain name change, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search release of both "Yandex" and Google, you can watch pirate copies of Netflix's series "Game in the Calm" and "The Kindness" of director Anna Melikan - the original series of the largest in Russia.
On Kinogo, which is also available for search engine release, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but, according to the quality of the video, it is the so-called screen (drawn in the cinema pirate copy of the film).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Universe. 10 years later" of the TNT TV channel (includes "Gazprom Media") is available.

Dimax Micro Ultramayette mattress, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultramayette.
The model is convenient because it has two different surface softness – high hardness and slightly more than average.
Only high-quality and premium fillers are included in the composition of the product, which have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model is installed a block of independent springs "micropack".
This means that there are 2,000 spirals on the bed that work fully autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point-to-point configuration.
"Micropack" is the highest-frequency of all the variety of "Dimax" spring blocks, so it has a distinct orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillings: at the top and bottom of the springs are installed combinations of layers of latex and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, then the other is coconut shell.
Such a tandem of fillers has long held the status of classical, as it transmits to the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the cornea provides the right back support, then latex gives the surface adaptation to the human body.
Case: The model comes in a simplified Aloe Vera knitted jacket.
At the customer's request, it can be made both filmable and stationary.
The total height of the product – 27 cm, the recommended load on the bed – 170 kg.
Warranty and security: Warranty period – 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress is CertiPUR certified.
Estonian scientists are looking for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Actual Camera reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions in five years is to assess the suitability of Venus’s clouds for life, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content in Venus’ clouds.
It has been assumed that the Venus cloud, the planet closest to Earth, is too acidic to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a probe from Venus is expected to arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that life on earth has not begun.
If it is different, it is possible that life is more likely to have originated on Earth,” said Mikhkel Pausalu, head of the Estonian Venus Life Finder project.

The meta-universe will change the Russian business
The topic of meta-assessment became popular in autumn this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook’s transformation into Meta.
For the market, this event has become an important signal: the biggest player has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
So, the business in Russia, as in the whole world, will invest in the creation of its own metal settlers and their subsequent monetization.
The meta-universe is worth considering as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the tendency to create remote interactions in the context of a pandemic is because people are tired of disintegration and limitations.
On the other hand, it is a result of the business’s desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models under them.
Thirdly, they are a logical continuation of the asset digitization trend, when any rights, securities, artworks and even money are transformed into a digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fat and harmful.
Of course, we'll have a holiday and a traditional olive tree, and a swamp under the bush, but nobody makes me eat everyone right away.
You can eat a spoon, try - and that's enough.
After all, in advance and truly ten weekends, you can prepare any tasty and useful dishes.

The British economist could not predict 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022, as he believes such attempts will turn out to be a failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in the second place - inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in commodity prices is temporary or not.
Before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of the infinite generosity of central banks has already survived” and it is time to go back to relationships where inflation-based interest rates will correlate with the expected pace of GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that a continuation of super-soft economic policy against the background of the pandemic could, according to some experts, lead to a new spike in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to productivity growth, as well as increasing poverty and climate change, O'Neill summed up.
Earlier, Michael Schulgin, head of Global Investing Opening, said that positive expectations for the dollar in 2022 will remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar, Schulgin called the Fed’s monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.
I'm forced to agree.
But one thing is happy: if you compare yourself to yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There’s progress, only progress.
There is another problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people don’t know about them.
All eco-taxes that take the waste out of the house.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country’s GDP
According to the results of the 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics of the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state in support of citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount was comparable to more than 4.5% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020.
In terms of revenues in the Russian market is led by the Korean brand Kia.
In 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the year before.
In the related Kia brand Hyundai the increase is even more significant - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
At the leading positions of this brand and the increase in the weighted average car price - for a year at Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - the strongest travel dynamic was only for Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, the sales volumes of Korean brands have not increased so significantly: according to the statistics of the Committee of Automakers of the European Business Association in Russia, in terms of quantity, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in the same period than the year before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closes three of the leaders in the volume of sales in monetary terms Japanese Toyota - on the cars of this brand the Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles in 10 months, which is 14% more than the year before.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (<0x2B>75%) - the German premium brand also increased sales volume (37%), and the weighted average price of the car (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
“Mercedes-Benz is simultaneously seeing good sales growth and a weighted average price – more than, for example, BMW – from here and greater financial capacity growth,” explained Napi CEO Tatiana Arabadji.
“At the pace of sales growth, fantastic figures are shown by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased financial capacity this year.”
Russian Lada on the dynamics of growth of revenues shows average market figures (plus 28%), on cars of this brand the Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles in 10 months.
At last year’s level of financial capacity are companies whose car sales in parts fell in 2021: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and everything in the minus - in 10 months, the Russians spent 12 billion rubles on off-road trucks and trucks of this brand versus 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automobile components and production breakdowns covering the entire world auto industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust the prices - the same "AutoVAZ" increased the cost of cars Lada models seven times a year, the last 8 trips.
Regularly re-evaluate values for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volumes of Russia’s automotive market in monetary terms will continue to increase – in addition to the car deficit, inflation, as well as the desire of car companies to recover past losses, experts believe.
In the face of car shortages, I think many car companies have even been able to partially transfer to the consumer the costs of past periods that they couldn’t put into the price of cars before.
says analyst "VTB Capital" on autoprom Vladimir Bespalov. -
I think that financially, automakers are feeling very well right now, maintaining a high margin of sales.”
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of car value, which is observed during 2021, prices for new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert said.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complicated design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With the increase in the offer, the opportunity to raise prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow and in the coming year, even if the growth in the cost of the car slows down, car manufacturers will be able to get their income by the volumes, noted independent automotive consultant Sergey Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now car manufacturers are looking to get the most profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev.
Increases in the production of machines are not expected to be minimal in the next six months, while in Russia aggiota is heated even by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the situation in the market, cars proved to be a good object for investment - bought a year ago the car, even with a run, can now be sold more expensive than the original cost, the expert notes.
Biden spoke about transferring U.S. military to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in the event of Russia’s “invasion”.
This statement was made by U.S. President Joe Biden.
"There have never been such plans," the White House chief said, responding to a journalist's question about whether the U.S. has given up on such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of a escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The U.S. leader also said that the possibility of using U.S. troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will move forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
“We will have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the Eastern Flange, B9 – all those NATO countries with regard to which we have a sacred commitment to protect them from any attack by Russia,” Biden said.
Earlier, Russian President Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of the drones provided by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".

Because to confirm his lie about his involvement in the power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to frighten and intimidate.
We need more useful advice for the people.
That's what you're talking about.

Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear.
