FANO of Russia to hold final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) will hold the third Expert Session "Assessment of the Effectiveness of Scientific Organizations".
The assembly will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, reported in a press release submitted to the editorial board "Lenta.Ru".
At the third meeting, it is planned to summarize the results of the Expert Session for the year and draw up a final list of indicators to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
Individual participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of the scientific teams and the criteria for the evaluation.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to form a single approach for all three academies to the methodology for evaluating the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have achieved this, and the final version of the regulatory documents is in agreement.
After the results of the next session, we must complete the formation of the processes of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and deadlines of the evaluation," - said Elena Aksenova, head of the expert and analytical management of the FANO of Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than 100 scientific institutes of Russia.
As a result, a resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow city, Solyanka street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California at Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its impact on chemical uniformity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow you to search among the stars related, i.e. those originated from one cluster.
The results of their research were published in the journal Nature, and you can read them briefly on the university’s website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of nearby stars is turbulent mixing in the gas clouds that preceded the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the stellar cluster, by its chemical composition, it is possible to determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of the stellar relatives.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The results of the simulation carried out by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, experts using a supercomputer modeled two streams of interstellar gas that together formed the cloud.
For several million years, this object, under the influence of its own gravity, is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added paint tags to the original gas streams and found that fast turbulent mixing in the cloud achieves a high degree of chemical uniformity.
According to astrophysicists, their research proves that it is possible to search for related stars in chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Carrata police arrested a 20-year-old after chasing a high-speed motorcycle
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at a speed of 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and across a bushland to hide from the police in Pilbar.
A transport police patrol in Carrata this morning attempted to stop the blue motorcycle, finding that its speed reached 125 km/h when it left from a service station on Batgate Road.
Police report that the motorcyclist did not stop and continued the movement along the Burgess Road, then turned into a bushland, resulting in the police losing his sight.
The motorcycle and the person corresponding to the driver's description were spotted next to the house at Walcott Way in Bulgare.
Carrata police have accused a 20-year-old man of refusing to stop and dangerous driving.
He is due to appear before the Carrata World Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.

George Webster accused of rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The man will be brought to trial on charges of rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, has been charged during the hearing of the High Court in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman at the Scottish Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
Webster allegedly attacked her when she was "unconscious, asleep and unable to give consent."
Webster is also accused of raping another woman at the Golf Wyw hotel in Nairn, which is located on the North Scottish Mountains, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Ray appointed a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh on 17 November.
Lavrov: Russia will not "slap the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not “knock the door” in connection with new sanctions.
This was stated today by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergei Lavrov, speaking before students and teachers of the MGIMO.
“As for our responses to a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything has to be specifically calculated,” he said.
And when we understand what the European and American partners will like this time, then we will make decisions on how to respond to this.
This will not be related to knocking on doors, any insults misunderstood, the minister stressed.
First and foremost, we will withdraw from our interests, the interests of protecting our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from our partners’ actions on their adequacy, contractability and reliability.
According to the steps taken in the area of sanctions, it is very well to judge what partners are seeking, - continued the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
If they say in the whole voice that “these sanctions will be painful for us too, but we are forced to go to it to punish Russia,” it is probably not very appropriate.
As for the WTO exit of Russia in response to possible new sanctions, no.
We, on the contrary, want to more actively master the WTO’s instrumentality, including when it comes to trade disputes,” Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome, we believe, the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and at the same time anti-dumping measures are being applied against the industries of the Russian economy.
“We are ready to implement the WTO mechanisms and to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the EU’s third energy package in a retrospective manner,” Lavrov said.
How to correctly use a siren in the design of the garden?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since the siren after flowering loses its main appeal, it is desirable to plant it together with other bushes.
It combines perfectly with many cultures.
And next to the siren you can and need to plant both plants, decorative at other times, and blooming at the same time.
Another plus of the siren is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stem tree of different heights, an improved shrub, a broad-based shrub, and even the likeness of a garden bonsai - a tree with a strangely curved stem.
Just choose the shape that best suits the design of your garden.
In Karelia for the sale of fake money convicted resident of the Leningrad region
According to the Republican Ministry of the Interior, the man was engaged in his criminal fishing in the Oloneck and Segej districts.
Apart from Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in inheriting in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonetz district court.
And to end the investigation into the crimes committed in our republic, it was staged in Segeju.
In the process of the investigation, several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money, relating to the summer of 2013, have been proven guilty.
At the end of June of this year, criminal cases with prosecution were brought to trial.
On Friday, August 29, the court ruled to replace the detention period for four years with the detention period in a common-law colony.
The sentence did not come into force legally.
Last week, two other counterfeit money vendors were convicted, who were paid by them in Petrozavodsk stores.
The citizens of Azerbaijan also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is deprived of liberty for five years, the other for four.
A fine of 500,000 rubles is imposed on each.
The sentence has not yet entered into force.
In Arkhangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish"
The meeting, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish delivered military assistance from the United States and the United Kingdom to the USSR.
In Arkhangelsk, the memorial ceremony was held at the laying stone of a future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the banks of Sedov in Solomon Islands.
The event was attended by representatives of the veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children of the Cadet class.
We first met twenty-three years ago when a stone was laid.
But at the same time, today’s event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who did not return to the sea,” said Boris Karpov, Chairman of the Board of Veterans of the Northern Sea Steaming.
Then, at the event, the city spirit orchestra performed, and the students of the cadet classes gave flowers to the veterans and marched with the flags of Russia and the flag of Victory.
The meeting ended with the laying of flowers on the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped boots, lead, wool and many other inventories and equipment).
In addition, on board the ships were also military equipment and weapons - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Harrikein fighters, in dismantled condition.
At the same time, the escort convoy consisted of 16 ships of the British Navy, including two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of the ships was not detected by the enemy and safely reached the destination - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 transport ships and about 50 warships were killed.

Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis proposed a bill under which the organization of trade unions is protected as a civil right.
“Where unions are, there are middle-class jobs,” said Alison, a Minnesota Democrat who is co-chair of the Progressive Fraction Congress.
That is why I am proud to present the Workers' Rights Enlargement Act along with the symbol of the John Lewis Civil Rights Movement.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunities in discriminating against the organization of trade unions, as in other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of the opponents of trade unions
The amendment of the Labour Relations Act to allow workers who are discriminated against for their participation in the organization of trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and penalties - is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is undoubtedly not a radical initiative – at least according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Allison, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill offer is to remember the very American thought.
Despite the attacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states around the country – Americans have once supported countries around the world in accepting, expanding and respecting labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country defended at the same time democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to an organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hideka Tojo was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly acknowledged that “the right of workers to an organization, to negotiation, and to collective action is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that ensured that Adolf Hitler’s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations in order to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or area of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will not have legal effect; measures aimed at these purposes will be considered unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as an instrument of universal protection, Roosevelt and the composers included the guarantee of the "rights of what to do."
For generations, Americans have taken the basic position that labour rights are human rights.
When this country consulted other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organise trade unions – and that the trade union should participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government institutions – should be.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise indeed to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to an organization and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the strength of the nation, but has increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, the trade unions have miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers us as well.
The official recognition of labour rights as human rights – and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against the organisation of trade unions – have long been ripe.
Kit Allison and John Lewis revive ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
Judge temporarily blocks law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the U.S., a federal judge temporarily blocked Louisiana law, which his supporters say is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed to execute by Louisiana Governor Bobby Ginadl in June and was due to enter into force on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be obliged to have the authority to receive patients in the hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that at the moment, doctors can continue to perform legal abortions, continuing to seek such powers.
"The prosecutors will be allowed to work legally, continuing the act of obtaining powers," Judge John deGravells wrote in his ruling.
The hearing will be appointed within a month during which the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
Defenders of the right to abortion were happy to meet this decision, the latter in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to get hospital credentials.
"Today's decision ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from a cowardly law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Nortap, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a lawsuit against a three-in-five man.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision relates to doctors from the two clinics, who did not act as applicants in this case, and also filed an application for admission authority.
Louisiana is among the 11 states that have passed such laws, and the courts have recently found such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, together with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that laws on admission powers impose restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortions object that such measures are aimed at protecting women’s health, although some have also noted their positive effect in the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admissions powers, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing this procedure, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing this procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions as long as their claims to the authority await a decision.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products?
At least half of the products for each type of product in the range of retail networks should be of Russian production, says the deputy of the State Duma from the faction "Just Russia" Oleg Nilov.
The parliamentary has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.
The document will be further detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
“According to the other groups of products produced in Russia, the retailer will have to supply at least half of its shelves to domestic producers,” Nilov said.
Along with the amendments to the article "On the basis of state regulation of trade activity in the Russian Federation" the bill provides for the introduction of an amendment to the Tax Code, which establishes a reduced rate of VAT of 10% when implementing products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trade networks is part of a package of stimulating measures for Russian producers.
There will be several times more domestic goods on the shelves.
However, the initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company "Nalogovik", a member of the independent expert center "Public Duma" Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food sector, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
In addition, there will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means profits will grow.
In addition, they will be given the right to dictate their terms and prices to retailers because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase the volume of their activities and sales, which will lead to the payment of higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some will grow faster, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, indeed, not immediately,” the expert notes.
In the past, Russian companies were often unable to break into the shelves of local stores due to the high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the embargo has been introduced, this niche has been released and you can breathe with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that after all necessary agreements and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, there is now a "moment of comfort" when the former players have already left, and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, it is possible to talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the increase in prices for finished products," - said AiF.ru first vice president of the all-Russian public organization "Russian club of financial directors", K.E. Tamara Kasyan.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian foodstuffs in each category will allow to consolidate the sector behind local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, not with goods that are cheaper at the expense of subsidies from another state.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will be unfolded between companies working under the same industry laws.
On the other hand, Kasyanov notes, Russian manufacturers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots far from all the articles.
And in this situation, trade networks will have to "draw" the share of Russian goods to half of the assortment.
In this regard, there are growing fears that poor quality goods will be delivered to the shelves.
Possibly, in the form of produced in Russia, foreign products will be delivered with the labels that have been broken," - adds the expert.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that benefit from cooperating with importers.
It is logical that with such a schedule, foreign suppliers themselves will be affected, as the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods can also affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production can yield in quality to imported analogues, while stores will be able to shake prices on seconds, as if they were a shortage of goods.
Forgotten in the early 2000s, the idea of import substitution was again discussed in February of this year due to the continuous devaluation of the ruble.
Against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of discontinuation of imported products is becoming even more relevant.
The law is designed to oblige retailers when forming orders to consider suppliers with domestic manufacturers.
Then we will go the way of import replacement much faster and more confidently, and a system of production planning for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time," - says MP Oleg Nilov.
A particularly effective quota mechanism would be for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to completely cover the shelves of Russian stores.
In addition, a powerful impulse can also get meat production.
As is known, the largest share of imports is kept for beef - from 30% to 35%.
As a result, 65-70% is still on Russian products," - Kasyanova argues.
Experts believe that the introduction of quotas on domestic products will facilitate import substitution and may accelerate the process.
However, this initiative in itself will not lead to an import substitution, because it requires a complex of measures, Litvinenko believes.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be imported from abroad, which means that full import substitution will not take place, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, there is little to set quotas, it is still necessary to set in the country the production of domestic products in order to meet these quotas.
These quotas are exactly such guarantees and will provide,” the expert notes.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment means that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video in memory of their dead mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural areas in Australia are at a higher risk of ovarian cancer death than those living in cities.
The researchers analyzed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent survived five years after being diagnosed.
Senior researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Research said that the probability of dying during the study was 20 percent higher in those living in regions and remote areas of the state than in those living in urban areas.
NEW MEDICAMENTS Might Slow Lung Cancer and Ovarian Cancer
Researchers tracked the medical path of women for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the woman’s age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socioeconomic status also influenced the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
While the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that premature diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible facts.
“This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly found in large cities,” she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of outbound services that would allow specialists to treat women closer to home, and support programs for people passing treatment away from home may help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, emphasizing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elisha Niv, was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open its doors in Kuzhenerski district
Construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaibelak was started in April of this year and was carried out on a typical project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million rubles.
As reported by the Public Relations and Information Administration of Head Mary El, the construction of the facility was financed by means of the Republican budget in accordance with the addressing investment program.
The total area of the built therapeutic and prophylactic institution is almost 230 square meters.
It will provide medical care to the inhabitants of eight settlements: the village of Toktaibelyak and the village of Dementievo, Puncherumal, Tunya, Fomici, Toraibelyak, Shinur and Chashchaal.
The new Feldsher-accustomer point will replace the existing FAP, whose building was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new institution will be opened in the near future.
The man who killed his four-month-old son in a state of emergency will appear in court
The resident of Chuvashia will be on the bed of the accused for the murder of his own child.
The Cheboksar investigation into a criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation found that on July 26 of this year, the accused, along with his four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birthday of his cousin's child in Cheboksary.
After a long sit, the newcomer decided to stay in the guest room and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, the lazy woman laid him next to him in bed to breastfeed, but soon fell asleep.
During his sleep, the woman hit his son, resulting in his death from a stroke.
The criminal case, reports the press service of the SCR on Chuvashia, referred to the court.
Inflation is out of vacation.
Will the Russians feel a sharp price increase?
As a result of the cross-sanctions of Russia and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not be put into the forecasts of the authorities, the analysts "VTB Capital" are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, RBC Daily writes.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and less - 6.5%.
However, according to the newspaper Kommersant, this week the Ministry of Finance is expected to make “small but fundamental” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast before 2017.
According to the publication, the agency could lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected slowdown in population income growth.
The prognosis predicted that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation are valid for a year - until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation implies a one-off shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change,” a source in the Ministry of Finance said.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government’s financial and economic bloc regarding inflation and forecast a price increase of 8% in 2014.
The main effect of food bans will come together with the possible introduction in the regions of Russia of sales tax (VAT) in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflation peak of 9% will be due in February, after which annual price growth will go down, experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat submitted the first inflation results after the Russian Federation imposed "clean sanctions".
AiF.ru interviewed experts and figured out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the Analytical Department of FC AForex:
Price increases are already seen in the main commodity segments.
Moreover, when socially significant products began to be valued, the government was forced to launch systemic monitoring measures on price stability to prevent the risks of unreasonable price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulatory authorities so that the authorities know exactly who is initiating an increase in prices, when and for what reason.
The key factors of the growth of the consumer price index continue to remain colossal flows of capital, over-refining of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, the internal conversion of the singles because of the evasion of the population to foreign currencies, as well as the exchange rate.
If inflationary pressure remained under control, the cost of the minimum product basket would not have jumped 12% in just one quarter.
The ban on imports of foodstuffs provoked a shock of supply in the domestic market and led to a completely logical increase in the final value.
Since at this stage we are unable to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the response sanctions will continue to carry the risks of growth of the inflationary component.
If we add to this the fiscal reasons associated with the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the deteriorating economic growth prospects, by the end of this year inflation could well exceed 8%.
Alexander Razuvaev, Director of the analytics department "Alpari"
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, at zero it was also above the current level, another case that was then offset by rapid economic growth.
At the end of the year, inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Plato Maguta, Managing Assets of UK "Fond Maguta"
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is being successfully deterred, but if there is a further increase in pressure, first and foremost, on the financial sector - it can lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually bought for traditionally.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But the price rise begins traditionally after the summer calm and may be more noticeable this fall.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia at 7.5% is likely to remain, as the Russian Federation still has financial accumulations.
Gardening centers are saddened by the decrease in the number of homeowners
Such a decline, due to the exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could lead to gardening centers beginning to lose tens of millions of pounds a year, when today's common young consumers reached the "basic age of gardening", according to the study.
According to the report, homeowners spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that homeowners spend on gardening.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting the courtyards in front of the house for parking, and the reduction in the size of the garden as other factors that pose a threat to the industry, the annual sales volume of which is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>5.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, the UK’s lowest level of spending on household goods for gardeners.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that renting housing and lack of space for the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser at RHS, said: “Cultivating plants in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move.”
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of retail horticultural goods as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after unfavorable conditions in March and April last year.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture carried out a mass cleaning in the "Agriculture" fund
Three of the four directors of the Agricultural Fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the “Agriculture” fund were replaced on Friday.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture officially reported only the removal from the post of Executive Director Atanas Dobrev.
His place was occupied by Lozano Vasileva.
It turned out that on Friday two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were quietly replaced.
Deputy Executive Director Tatiana Angelova, who was previously responsible for state aid and the SAPARD program, has been released, reports BGNES with reference to the newspaper "Trud".
I did not attend the Board of Trustees because by law we are not members of the Board of Trustees, but I was later informed that I was released.
I can’t say why my dismissal is not reported on the fund’s website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to find out more on Monday,” Angelova told the publication.
It will be replaced by Ivanka Bagdadov, who has been the head of Investment Loan at the Central Fund at Agriculture in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for the fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional management of the "Agriculture" fund in the city of Veliko-Tyrnovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the Attije Aliyeva-Veli Foundation retained his post.
She is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the Office are not mentioned.
Turkey calls U.S. diplomat in connection with espionage report
Turkey’s Foreign Ministry has called on the country’s highest-ranking U.S. diplomat for clarification on a report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. businessman and Turkish officials had discussed the message on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority reconnaissance facility for U.S. and British intelligence servicemen.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has reduced the importance of this message, saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reported that the main German intelligence agency had also made Ankara an object of intelligence, sparked a more angry response from the Turkish government.
China’s Largest Companies Unite Against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China’s largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (China’s largest search engine), are creating a company that will compete in Alibaba’s online retail market.
However, catching the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left even its American rivals – eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of the Greatest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan (<0x24>814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of which will be owned by Wanda and 15% - each of the Internet companies, the Wanda Group said in a statement.
Registration of the company is planned in Hong Kong.
SP will combine Baidu’s search services with the popular social platform WeChat (China’s largest social network with a user base of around 438 million people), Tencent and Wanda’s infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 fashionable hotels, the Wanda Group manages at least 49 commercial real estate properties across China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than <0x24>8 billion) in the construction of a cinema studio and theme park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the shores of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and bring a profit of <0x24>960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American network of cinemas AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest operator of cinemas in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its own shopping malls, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, which will be developed by Alibaba’s new competitor.
Dun Che, who will lead the new company, said Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new platform is expected to become the world’s largest online-to-offline platform, says Dun Ce.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) trading is to attract online buyers so that they come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is coupon sales services such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the biggest “pearl” in online commerce,” said director Wanda Van Jianlin.
“There is no real O2O site in China now, and in this situation the odds are roughly the same,” he said.
The Chinese e-commerce market is the largest in the world, and according to McKinsey & Co., its volume will increase more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to <0x24>395 billion.
The number of Chinese internet users has grown to 632 million, according to Bloomberg’s official statistics: it is more of a population of any country in the world, with the exception of India.
And according to forecasts, by 2015 this number could grow to 850 million people.
The Union of the Richest
Tencent Ma Huaten was China’s richest man until recently, but according to the Bloomberg millionaire index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already surpassed him by <0x24>5.5 billion.
Jack Ma’s condition is estimated at <0x24>21.8 billion, of which <0x24>11 billion is his share in Alibaba.
Baidu leader Robin Lee is now ranked third among the richest people in China, while Wang Jianlin from Wanda is fourth in the rankings.
"It's very interesting to observe this battle: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge the even richer," said Bloomberg, director of the Chinese e-commerce research center in Hangzhou, China.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after its creation: “Rome cannot be built in a day.”
The fact that it is not so simple to compete with Alibaba not only with new companies, but also with well-deserved leaders of the world’s online trade, is evidenced by a report published earlier on Alibaba’s financial performance for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than its two U.S. competitors combined.
Alibaba’s net profit over the period almost doubled its competitor’s aggregate figure – it almost tripled annually to <0x24>1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has huge money-generating potential, largely thanks to its mobile apps,” said Bloomberg, a report from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to Alibaba’s updated prospectus on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile users of the company’s services in July amounted to 188 million, significantly above the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter had to be on mobile devices.
Alibaba has to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company could be estimated at <0x24>187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place on September 16.
The road-show of the company that preceded this event will start on September 3.
It is expected that Alibaba’s IPO release will be a record in NYSE history and will allow the company to attract about <0x24>20 billion.
To date, the record for the amount of funds raised on the U.S. stock exchanges was owned by the Visa payment system, which in 2008 carried out the primary placement of its shares, earning <0x24>17.9 billion.
At least half of the foodstuffs in the commercial networks should be of Russian production, state Duma deputies believe.
They have drafted a law on this subject.
We are talking about amendments to Article 8 of the FS "On the basis of state regulation of trade activity in the Russian Federation" and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of domestic products in stores should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so a "discount" will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law is also amending the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% in the implementation of all foodstuffs, the country of origin of which is Russia, reports the newspaper "Izvestia".
On August 27, the lower house of the parliament was introduced a bill on amendments to the FZ "On retail markets", which proposes to revive in Russia the agricultural markets, where small producers will be able to market their products.
Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Majorca Public Prosecutor on Friday.
Calvia’s chief of police on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested on charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the scandalously well-known Magaluf’s drunkenness center.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street on which most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the daily online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Majorca prosecutor for the fight against corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by guards of the Spanish National Guard on corruption charges and will be interrogated by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that dissatisfied nightclub owners say that protectionism by the authorities is seriously affecting the state of their business.
“It’s no longer about making money, it’s about surviving,” one of the businessmen told the court.
We cannot put our sources of existence at risk.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf came to the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer who made a pass to 24 men while running bars.
The island's authorities have since tried to stop the humiliation of the resting Magaluf, minimizing the number of scandalously well-known alcohol runs on the bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club where the incident occurred was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Carnage bar runners were fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 (<0x24>73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular among young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous alcoholic-drinking accidents associated with a crazy fun known as the "bash balcony" when people jump from one balcony to another balcony or balcony.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
The spring prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city at 9 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm, which fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short, windy rains, including a storm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter released an early portion of spring last week, the temperature again dropped on Monday to a peak of only 15.8C in the city.
Skilled conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in boarding the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was due to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but it landed in the wind shift zone - a sudden change in speed or wind direction at a short distance - and was forced to take up altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to raise altitude during the second landing, and the plane, in the end, landed at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay of this flight has resulted in several other flights being delayed, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday with the likelihood of one or two rains.
Calculation of estimates of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service takes special control over pricing, construction industry regulation, and network connection issues.
The FAS has established an expert council on the development of competition in the construction sector.
At his meeting, the head of the management of the control of CIS, construction and natural resources of FAS Vadim Solovyev said that "Today's calculation of the estimates of construction facilities is absolutely unclear".
The normative base makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unfounded construction price, according to the FAS.
And offer the cost of building state-owned facilities at the design stage to determine on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of today's estimated norms and unit pricing for technological operations.
These proposals have been put in the Roadmap and are now being considered in Minsk.
“Replacement of traditional estimate documentation in construction to calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” explained Vadim Solovyev.
After all, now every bolt and nut is counted in the estimate, and it does not always seem possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation, unfaithful construction companies can bury "whole tractors".
In Minnesota, I agree with the FAS.
"The first work on the transition to calculating the cost of structural elements already exists: methods of calculating prices for structural solutions have been developed, calculations based on these indicators," - said the head of the Department of Urban Activities and Architecture of Minnesota.
As a pilot chosen the field of road construction.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the construction company "Profi-Invest" Anatoly Demyanko said, the estimates have long since become obsolete, but another mechanism for the business has not yet been proposed.
“As for the proposed calculations on the structural elements, this is difficult to implement in practice, as the construction of buildings often uses completely different technologies,” he says.
It’s no secret that the building market is developing in large part thanks to the government’s procurement.
In the opinion of the chairman of the board of the NP "Expert Community of Public Procurement Professionals" Ekaterina Lesina, today the state is the most payable customer.
Deputy Director of Engineering of the Industrial Center of Capital Construction Rosatom Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts, and companies that own monopoly competences and do not allow this to happen.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is as secured as possible from someone’s managerial influence.
At the expert council it was proposed to form a system of state procurement in such a way that the same performer is not entitled to receive more than one contract in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles. or several contracts in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry believes that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of the impact on the business, as well as the efficiency of building management.
As explained by Elena Zhukov, in this case it will be necessary to assign the customer the functions of the contractor, which will lead to an increase in the number of employees of the customer and the budget costs for his content.
At the same time, the specialists of the customer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by the contracting organizations, as well as their safety.
Often, with such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the object as a whole.
In addition, this approach could lead to the outflow of highly qualified public procurement participants due to a lack of interest in obtaining a public contract for incomplete work and a small amount of contract.
Deputy Head of the Expert Advisory Centre of the Institute of Procurement Alexander Eustachenkov believes that now the state procurement procedure has become a business game at the attention of the contractor.
And he gave an example: "The participant when filling in the application must specify "specific indicators" without specifying the words: "or equivalent", "must be", "from", "more", "less", "analog", "or", "type", "may be", "may be", "not the same type", "below", "may be", "higher", "may be".
Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of the application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another problem 44-FZ, according to Eustachenkov, was the need to assess the quality of the work through the participant's "paper" offer at the application stage.
Considering the application of the participant, it is really possible to evaluate only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, which has not even started to be carried out, - the expert believes.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is accepted.
The expert council also proposed to move marginal income from the upper to the lower skeleton so that intermediate contractors would disappear.
The chairman of the expert council, the status-secretary, head of the FAS Andrey Tsarikovsky believes that this should not be done, as the contractor-general must be responsible for the order.
And otherwise it will happen, as in Arkady Rykin’s famous reprisal “Atelier”: “Is there a claim to the buttons?”.
Israeli Children Return to School After the Gaza Strip War
Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and rain mines fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools remained in the Gaza Strip.
The beginning of schooling brought a sense of joy and excitement to the rocket-affected settlements in southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the children's garden "Pascha", which was hit by a rocket, removed traces of fragments from the walls and children's courtyards before the arrival of the students.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward to the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibuza Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to go back to a dimensional life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was “a little strange” to start school again.
“It was a difficult time and we didn’t leave our homes at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement stopped the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad did not go out to the streets or leave their homes, moving to safer areas away from the Gaza Strip to escape a rocket and a mine.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the border with Gaza, where a fragment of a Palestinian mine was killed by a 4-year-old boy, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza that was heavily damaged by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study diligently and said, “We will do our best to give you knowledge and ensure your safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the withdrawal of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; however, it did not provide any substantive evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 missiles and mines in Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people have found shelter in more than 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
Due to the fact that tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and the fighting continued, officials in charge of education postponed last week the beginning of the school year.
“I hope the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as children of the world and as Jewish children,” said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza’s schools.
According to the popular criterion, the price of the property showed the highest winter increase in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing cost index for housing prices in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase led to a combined increase in June, July and August of 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the 12-month increase as of August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lowelless said that Sydney and Melbourne are leading the two-level market.
RP Data figures show that housing prices in Sydney have risen by 16.1 percent over the past year, while in Melbourne they have risen by 11.7 percent.
The next power markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five to six percent.
On the other end of the scale was Canberra, which had government spending cuts, where prices rose by just 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lowell said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties on sale over the next few months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high sales rate and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will continue to rise over the next three months,” he said.
How people live in Ufa's oldest house
Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov have 18 apartments in the former house of gold-producers and miners on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (the former Grand Kazan).
The house of the eighteenth century has virtually not changed since its construction, except for its old age.
Foreign people come here as a tour, and the residents suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufim house, the walls of which are remembered by commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is less than 300 years old.
The old yard, always the door open, the crawling ladder.
The doors of the apartments are located close to each other, the walls collapsed, and the street can be seen in the lights from the enveloped concrete places.
Looks like everything's up to the honest word.
And the locals say, “You don’t think that’s true.”
It is very difficult to live in a wooden house of the eighteenth century, says Tatiana Lukyanova, resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is in the state custody, but the money for its contents is not allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits, which the authorities have simply forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still thin and poor, but the whole foundation has disappeared.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can I be happy in such circumstances?
The road passes right under the windows, not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana's pulling the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before: there is a flow of cars under the windows.
You see, the glasses are constantly defrosting, we can't open the windows, and we're used to the noise.
Man is accustomed to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are golden.
In addition, we have two rooms, living with three sons.
And in other families the conditions are much worse, on the second floor the ceilings are generally a little more than a half meters high.
For contrast, Tatiana offers to visit the neighbor of apartment No 6 Ludmille Starostina.
A pleasant hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile tells:
We have one bedroom apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, so we live: we are with husband and daughter with granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, there's never been another living place, - Ludmilla surrounds the room with the eyes: antressoli, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them was a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very narrow and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical".
But from the ceiling flows regularly: the water system is nowhere suitable.
Lyudmila talks about her apartment routinely and surprisingly at the same time as an Italian whose house stands on the Roman ruins.
That is, it brings together a very old and a very recent, everyday and legendary one:
The water pipeline was built about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the corner and a toilet from the former cellar.
We live right where Demidov and his family lived, and there were servants on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, yes and why?
The Ufa Real Estate Center says that privatization doesn't matter.
We will still get only one-bedroom apartment, we can't claim more.
Four months ago we were promised to relocate, but the promise didn’t go any further.
I’m not used to complaining and I won’t.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandmother with grandfather, mom with dad, I with husband and my daughter with granddaughter.
It's all been for this time.
For example, huge rats ran through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flag, they are subway thick!
It is said that the solution was mixed on the eggs, so it lasts so long.
The house is well-built, thanks Demidov!
Probably just because he didn't kill anyone with the roof collapsed or his own.
Only the construction still slowly dies in our eyes: the boards and the brick houses are rotting, the floors have repeatedly failed, we watered with cement, but all useless - the solution goes into the ground as in a well.
It is said that there is - under our room a secret bath and walk to the river Belaj, which was specially made by the ancients who once lived here, so that you could hide from danger, in which case.
They were chased.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how a historian came to them, praying to let him start in the excavation apartment.
And then he convinced them to give a living space in exchange for his uncle on the October Avenue.
Ludmila rejected the historian:
Where are we four in one?
And there is a small hope here that will give the housing more spacious.
We agreed in exchange, we wouldn't win any more.
However, the old-family did not win anything.
Lyudmila's biggest dream was to be relocated, and her daughter with her 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
That is, the two families have allocated a two-room apartment instead of the most majestic ruins in which two generations now live.
Cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakov from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two narrow rooms of a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, lives her large family.
We are seven people, two children.
You can see what conditions.
The plaster is poured into pieces, as well as window frames, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rooms crossing holes.
The water in the crane is cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can make sure that the most lucky of all are the wives of Lavrentyev from apartment No 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, lots of places!
Room of 75 square meters, prescribed for three people.
We live precisely in those rooms where, according to legend, Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentiev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing - everything around the seams cracks, breaks down, breaks down.
Neighbors probably already told me.
The most torture we have with the floors: the wooden boards slipped, the ground literally went off under our feet.
I put the supports, the cradles; nothing in the room yet, but in the other room we go, as we climb on the benches, so much so that everything is shaky.
About the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitryevich can tell better than any tour guide.
The goldman is treated as a native, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was unusual: the owner of Kaginsky and Uzyansky factories built houses, poured guns and bells, held Ural mines.
The heirs of the merchant property are proud of the ancestor, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the 20th century, says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden rooms for carts, horse racks and carriage boxes, which were later demolished.
In 1968, we wanted to remove our house, but something was blocking...
The story repeated in 2014: the new housing was once again deceived.
We, according to the team, collected all the documents, surrounded the necessary instances, and suddenly learned that the move to the apartment is moving to 2015 or 2016.
Something we don't believe in anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
Residents did not accept.
They were sent from one table to another, and then, as a joke, issued a paper without a signature and a stamp: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the displacement of residents."
I even had the feeling that our house had not been in the city for a long time, because it was at first number 57, then 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like he was shot in the 70s.
"Russian Planet" addressed the leading sector of information and analytical work of the land resources management of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
House on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the relocation program of old housing.
I cannot be responsible for the actions of the officials of the 70s, but I know that at that time there was a plan to sweep all the old houses, despite their historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value - is successfully implemented.
Residents will soon be relocated to new apartments.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the Demidov House will be by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
An architectural biennial is now taking place in Italy, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 all the former Old Kazan Street will be restored, - says the official.
The houses will acquire an appropriate appearance that corresponds to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
The Demidova House is likely to be a museum open to all who wish.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
In the morning, unfortunately, it will not work, too much load of roads in the city.
Removing people from the future museum Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to remain satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from another era.
A forest fire started in Primorje because of the storm
The dry storm caused the occurrence of a forest fire in the territory of the Hunting Plot Forestry in the Pozhar region of Primorska region.
The grouping of forces and means is being increased at the site of the fire.
According to the leadership of the KGSBU "Primer Air Base", the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of the aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Head of Airbase:
The fire, which occurred in a hard-to-reach area, was detected by an observer pilot from aboard the An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
The wooden remains are burning on the old fireplace.
The strong congestion of the territory and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable landing areas for landing fireplaces create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
Delivery of the forces available to the airbase by Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was detected, four firefighters were promptly planted at the site of the extinguishing.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional forces and fire extinguishers.
In the area of lunch in the area of the village Hunter helicopter additionally delivered 3 firefighters.
As soon as the site for landing the helicopter in the area of the fire is ready, specialists will be moved to the site of detonation, according to the website of the Primorsky region administration.
Lenny Henry: My father never embraced me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses the comedy, "Rudy's Rare Discs", which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew up from a series of broadcasts on Radio 4.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and melodies are life-giving.
However, Henry had to go through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often reflects on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: "Stop making noise.
Stay away from your sister.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket hit.
I've never talked to him like that.
He was such a smiling guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Recently, Henry opened a casting workshop in Dudley and, although the conditions were better than in his father's days, he was able to look at what his life must have been like.
It's a little better now, but it's dark, smokey, the depths of the labyrinths of the underworld with flashes of fire and smoke and a bunch of sausages.
My father went into the bathroom and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing about himself because he wanted to get rid of the molding workshop.
When I got there, I realized that he was doing it for years and years to earn us food, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry came out of his childhood without parental love.
My father never embraced, never said, "I love you."
It was only when my mother got sick at the end of her life that we started to say, “I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Franch, allowed him to share the love he lacked in childhood.
Can you stop that "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don Frank.
Why shouldn't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They are still great friends with Franch, whom he was married to for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why shouldn't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very heavy.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
The change in Henry's career trajectory is perhaps reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since he was recognized by critics for his Otello, he has been completely immersed in the theater.
It was followed by the Comedy of Mistakes, and then the Complaints of August Wilson.
This work differs from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his saturated professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him parodiing on stage, and wrote about him in New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: “For quite a long time I was the only black-and-white/comicist on television.”
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in the eyes of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lennie in "New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the "Black and White Menstrual Show", a light entertainment program in which people "black their face", Henry discovered that he had been performing in it for five years.
My family didn’t like it very much.
I'd like that never happened to me, but I'm not sorry I've done it.
Although it was a strange, decent position, I worked on large squares and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "the award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also "a grotesque parody of black people."
Representing the characters who had mocked the culture of black people in the UK and sung it, Henry worked in an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s it was known as, among other things, chef Garrett Blacklock from the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising movies, documentaries, TV series and movie roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC show "LennyHenry.tv", he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit late or you're out of time."
Next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 titled "What's Good at...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
It cannot be said that I was taught this in school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of middle-class white people with panties and a hoodie down in front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the broadcast, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't make that noise until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from the last Otello monologue for documentary transmission, and he was trapped.
I have a feeling that I can do it.
Somehow my head was fixed.
"That's what it is, it's a serious business, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it in.
And she was successful.
It looked like they were waiting for a disaster, but it didn’t happen.
Soon we started the comedy of mistakes.
All of a sudden I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn’t believe it until the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.
“A silent voice inside me said, ‘You’ll have to work 10 minutes while they make a computer.’”
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else deal with this.
"You play the play, stay in the role."
Henry in Zaborah at the Daechs Theatre
It was difficult to learn the text for "Bads."
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign above, showing, "That's what you need to do."
He says it, of course, with a big voice.
So I'll hold on to this.
I really like that.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the mind of a comedian - all the way our conversation is interrupted by the flashes of his humor, when he starts, he ends parody.
I just decided not to work in the stand because this thing with instant reward from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you keep trying to do that all the time, it can lead to a halt.
I sometimes work at Live at Apollo whenever I want to, but, basically, I don't get the pleasure I used to.
I'm asking if he'll ever give me a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps give shape to the beginning, middle and end of the road – I don’t think I’ll ever want to give up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People like stories.
Kenya registers government officials to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya began biometric registration of all government officials in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the government’s payment statement.
Employees who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after they have left public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged to reduce corruption in state structures after coming to power in 2013.
Earlier this year, the audit found that at least <0x24>1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month is lost due to payments to “invisible workers” and other financial violations.
The government suspects that wages continue to enter bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyama Chebussyri of the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants are required to appear at identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data is collected through a biometric registration procedure, the government said in a statement.
Anyone who does not do this without a respectable reason will be removed from the payment statement, it says.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clean up the payment statement at both levels of the government - the structure of the government, therefore, will put an end to the problem of "workers-invisibly",
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with "conspiracy" against government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local news agencies said.
Police officials did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daley News.
Some of them participated in corruption identification activities in December last year, which were aimed at checking government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and hearing the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who at the time was Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told reporters that not all schools have reopened, but that he will do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
The first of September was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky above every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastukhov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, to which Yatsenyuk’s daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally settle here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold air balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found such an impressive leader she needs.
She is followed by a slap of fame from the world of banking, media management and the inner circles of the Tory Party.
In fact, she has her own experience working in managerial positions.
She began her career at Bain and Co, a global management consulting firm, and then went on to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world in Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a senior position at Pearson's took on a male colleague who held a lower position.
It is said that her earnings are approaching <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Its political rating is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, former BP chief, when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is former adviser Tory.
Earlier in May, I called the work of the president of the poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two directions: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outside as a voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
This is an almost inaccessible duopolist, which requires complete radical reform.
However, what new president would risk coming by dismantling and destroying the institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he deprived himself of work in this process.
It's a difficult decision.
It wouldn’t be so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC shrink in size after revising its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, inevitable licensing negotiations pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British acquire a stake in the world’s largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that the results of its work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them just 40p per day.
What’s more, Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
BBC viewing and usage models have changed: I now get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and inspiring institution.
He needs an impressive chairman, I hope he found him.
Perry from Texas says a humiliating tweet was written by an outsider
A tweet from a confirmed account of Texas governor of Republican Rick Perry on Sunday evening contained an insulting image of the District Attorney from Democrats, who is at the center of a criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
Twitter was later removed, followed by another one from Perry's account, in which this entry was debunked.
I just posted a tweet from my account that was written by an outsider.
“I don’t approve of this tweet, and I deleted it,” the post said.
Perry’s assistants did not immediately respond to messages asking for comments.
Although the records were uploaded from a verified Perry account, it was unclear who was actually publishing in this tape.
The earlier tweet contained an insidious cartoon on District Attorney Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of driving drunk in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding for her office when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
"I don't always drive a drunk car, three times the permissible level of alcohol in my blood, but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry of telling me about it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg Department did not conduct an investigation involving a large jury against Perry.
They were handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry did not plead guilty and called the allegations a political fraud.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, saying that the law used to prosecute the governor, who has been performing his duties for the longest time in Texas history, would prove to be contrary to the constitution.
Perry stopped funding for <0x24>7.5 million from the State Department of Public Control, which is based in Travis County and is prosecuting corruption in the public sector of Texas when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto caused an official complaint from the public control group, which had leftist views.
The ribbon of a verified Perry account is often updated – and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming fifth at a party congress in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he could get out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running by the lake, and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to its "normal state"
One of London’s most famous builders warned that the real estate market in southeast England had “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Houses in the capital have been the subject of lively demand and fast-growing prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble will push the Bank of England to set limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pigley, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of this fiscal year, the market has returned to a normal level of transactions since the peak of 2013,” adding that it provided a “stable working environment.”
The London real estate market prospered during the decline as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 per cent in just one year, according to the Land Register, significantly bypassing the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable and student schemes in Berkeley rose by about one-fifth last year, reaching <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London’s property less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential “family tax” before the general election.
The London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced tougher loan terms, would also lead to a decline in market growth as a half-price buy-and-sell deal.
Recent data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of mortgage loans approved in June, suggesting a further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast of London real estate price growth to 3 percent in 2015, based on the fact that the real estate price trend has already begun to weaken.
In the meantime, transactions have fallen by a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, demand for homes in the capital turned out to be very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales by more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Piggle added: “The demand for the right product with a good design and the best location has remained the same and, reflecting this, sales have been preserved for a long time.”
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes this year by the end of April – almost a third more than at the pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual earnings before tax payments rose by 40 percent compared to the previous year to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, earnings - 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Speaking before the company’s annual meeting on Monday, Piggy said Berkeley’s expected revenues for the year would meet current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, the profit is expected for the whole year before the payment of taxes of <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley's stock price stood at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in the second half of the day on the London Stock Exchange.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence posted on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
Photos of naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar, were posted on the internet by a hacker who claims to have a “catalogue” of photos of another 100 rising stars.
The star of Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real, and condemned the hacker for "a sudden invasion of private space."
Appeals have been made to law enforcement agencies, and they will be prosecuting anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the 4chan photo exchange site were allegedly obtained due to a lack of Apple's iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalog" of the victims of the hacking includes the names of a dozen women celebrities, including Carolyn Bunny.
It is unclear how many of these photos are genuine, although the star of "Scott Pilgrim vs. All" Winsted on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those who look at the photos that my husband and I took a few years ago when we were alone at home, I hope you're proud of yourself," Winsted wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis from Nickolodeon's series "iCarly" and "Victoria the Winner" denied that in the photos, she wrote on Twitter: "These so-called photos of my naked FALSHIVKI, people.
Let me stop it in the embryo. *calambur purpose*
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that representative of pop star Arianna Grande denied that the photos on which she is supposed to be authentic.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J" that gave praise to critics
They disintegrated, best of all, they gradually collapsed, like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only occasionally a woman told him that he was too serious, heavier in communication, tense, closed, and perhaps a little annoying.
And then she squeezed his hand.
He saw annoyance in himself.
He was a squirrel, yes.
The last victim of this witchcraft was a little novel, from which he expected more than usual, a release from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a terribly fragile beauty, with her hair slipped and a beating heart from the northern island village, farther and rougher than Port Royben.
She came to the south with a satellite older than herself, which Kevern considered her aunts, while the latter inherited a house in a crude but paradise-like valley under the cheerful name of "The Valley of Paradise".
No one lived in the house for years.
The pipes flowed, the spiders sat still in the baths, the slippers left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was full of greenhouses resembling giant cabbage shrubs.
It was like a cottage from a children’s book, both frightening and charming, with a full secret garden.
Author's View: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the long list of the 2014 Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eileen were sitting, holding hands, in broken beds in the grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; they both were distracted by a cheap console, which had provided the country with a calming, calming and refreshing music.
You have too big legs.
Due to their aggressiveness, songs of this type on the console were no longer played.
They weren’t banned – nothing was actually banned – they just didn’t lose anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, as the word itself "archaic".
The public taste did what could never be achieved by orders and prescriptions, and just as among the books people chose the memoirs of the rich who grew up in poverty, cookbooks and love novels, from all music they chose ballads.
Escape this day, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and sing Eileen’s big legs with a rough comic voice.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular jazz pianist's song, called Fats Waller," he told her, adding two fingers to her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it landed from his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played in it with his father, as he told him.
Start with "J" when you forget to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game at the time, and it wasn’t very fun right now.
He knew what he was expecting, that’s all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jazz was also not played, although he was not openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one “if” in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with the island.
Its unpredictability had an effect on people's nerves.
And jazz was an acoustic expression expressed with the help of music.
Although he reached the age of 10, never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembers a time when popular singers weren’t black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
The society was obedient, and this meant that every segment of it agreed with gratitude – the gratitude of those who were saved by fate – with the principle of group predisposition.
People of African-Caribbean descent in temperament and physical characteristics were well suited for the field of entertainment and sport – and they sang and ran.
The people of Indostan, as if they were naturally talented in everything about electronics, made sure that no family would be left without a working electronic phone.
What remained of the Polish diaspora was sanitary work; what remained of the Greek was plates.
The natives of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country, when THAT PRODUCTED, and if it did not happen, and the common cause, they were afraid that they were being accused of burning the flames, in fear of their own words.
Everybody's abilities.
Since she had previously only heard ballads, it was difficult to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just spoken to her could be put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Unless, perhaps, for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the starting garden gave him an illusion of security.
No word could penetrate through the sound insulation of giant leaves resembling cabbage.
Eileen didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn’t want to squeeze two fingers at her again.
She already thought him strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She untrustworthyly lifted her head, closing Keverna's review.
There was nothing in the whole world except the land of her black hair.
There's nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, sticking to her opinion.
But it still doesn't explain why you're eating it to me.
It looked like she was really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The legs, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
“I like you precisely because you have thick ankles,” he tried to say instead.
I'm so twisted.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often put him in an uncomfortable situation because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Cavern, did too.
In spite of the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons reddened and got up from the bedside, splashing the console and the wine they drank.
Wine from the beans, so drunkenness could not serve as an excuse to him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said.
Even if you don't like it.
He was sorry for her and for the excessive rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her gaze when she gave him resistance.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She did not talk to him about living in the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he did not doubt that in the main features she was similar to here.
The same huge ice-cold ocean hit them both.
The same men who were so much beaten, even more delicate and caprice after what happened, if they were more common than their ancestors, smugglers, and destroyers, they were thrown from pub to pub in rage, they were ready to be ready.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid pussy if she wasn't careful!
First kissed - kissing has now become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote from the fresh ballads that the console gave - first kiss her, then hit her.
Excessive clarification, according to Kevern, because the kiss itself was already a hooligan.
Eileen Solomons showed the Corps that he had to leave.
He got out of bed as an old man.
She herself felt the weight of lead, but the weight of his burning surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She looked at him leaving, and from the top window she looked at him leaving, her companion, a man, who had put on his own weight.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a sense of sympathy for him and the men at all, although some of them raised their hands on her.
A man who turned away from her, with a twisted back, shy, beaten, all the ability to fight left her – why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn’t remember any case, until today, when she would see it like that?
Once again, Eileen Solomons looked at her legs.
Twenty years before the above-described events, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Offnau, the unofficial public mood control service, has prepared a small report on the preservation of the low and medium-sized.
"A lot has been done, and a lot has been done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggression of people who fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these mixed branches, the good old-fashioned and narrow-fashioned settlements of the area, where, despite the old-fashioned couples.
However, some of the qualities are inexhaustible.
The higher the spike, the lower the passions that it generates.
The population pours tears over sentimental ballads, swallows the history of overcoming obstacles and declares their faith in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only the old coarseness of the naughty has its strong grip as in the rural communities, and so on.
“You have an annoying habit of writing too much,” her scientific director said, reading the report as a whole.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer,” Esme Nussbaum said.
You're a lesbian?
Esme once again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
“I ask,” said Luther Rabinovic, “not because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We have no prejudices here.
We are the servants of a society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as the ones you have shown me.
It is obvious that you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call “bad” and “brutal” would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural love of life and energeticness.
To continue to offer what has been done, if it has been done in general, as if it had happened, if it had happened at all yesterday, means to deprive the country of the vital force it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked at the sides while Rabinovitz spoke.
Behind his head, pink, like flamingo, LED letters repeated the advice that Offnau gave the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your wife, listen to ballads, go to music, talk on the phone, share, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A conversation is better than silence, a word of song better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you mean," Esme Nussbaum replied silently, as she was assured that her scientific director had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything other than that we haven't been cured as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we are repeating the mistakes that originally led to the THING THAT WAS PRODUCTED, WHEN THAT WAS GENERALLY PRODUCTED.
Only this time we will throw out our anger and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinovitz connected the fingertips into the pyramid.
This gesture should have meant endless patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “invoking the ‘mistakes’ of actions that our grandparents did or did not.
You go too far and when you talk about them throwing out their “rage” and “distrust” on “others.”
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that by understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we are not talking about "we" and "they".
There were no "we" and there were no "others."
It was a time of turmoil – that’s all we know.
“For which, to be honest with yourself,” Esme dared to say, “no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it’s good or bad, what’s done is done.
It was then.
There’s nothing else to say – we agree.
And as you don’t have to blame anyone, you don’t have to apologize if it’s appropriate or if something can be corrected.
But why the past, if not to learn...
The past exists to make us forget it.
If I could add a word to that --
The Pyramid of Luther Rabinovic collapsed.
“I’ll look at your report,” he said, dismissing it.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist, who went on the sidewalk, as described by the passers-by, "in evil anger".

Lesotho army says coup d'état was not planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Representatives of the Lesotho army denied the preparation of a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were acting against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying the country's army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Masera.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, saying he had been threatened with an assassination.
Army spokesman Major Ntle Ntoy said there was not actually a coup, but that the army responded to the threat from “political fanatics” that the police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Armed Forces of Lesotho took action, having received several intelligence reports that there were some elements among the police forces that were really planning to arm the generals of the Ameris, some of whom were young political fanatics," he said.
A spokesman for the South African government, Clayson Monel, said the military’s actions looked like a coup d’état.
"While no one has made a claim to the seizure of power by force, the actions of the Lesotho Armed Forces at the moment have the main signs of a coup," he said.
Representatives of the Lesotho army reported that the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motethjoa Metsing runs the government in the absence of Tabana.
Tabane said he believed he was being attacked in an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his united government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, despite allegations in reverse.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on rental rights in Milan, Milan Channel reported.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he was on the field as a member of the London club only three times.
In the past, Milan had leased the attacker Fernando Torres to Liverpool.
Eurozone production at its lowest rate in 13 months
Production growth in the eurozone slowed to its lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the eurozone manufacturing industry’s business activity index (PMI) by Markit fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed, and companies have been affected by growing tensions between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The securities came before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will expect the bank to have a clear plan of how to cope with the halt to the eurozone recovery, as well as the risk of deflation with inflation of just 0.3%.
There is an assumption that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, may give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative mitigation scheme for the euro area similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
“While some growth is better than any growth at all, the inhibitory effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more obvious,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The PMI of Germany’s manufacturing sector, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months, marking 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does Italy’s weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
The signs that the growth momentum is declining mainly in the industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also adds no confidence,” Mr. Dobson said.
The industry’s slowdown is likely to further fuel analysts awaiting the introduction of additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August survey of the eurozone manufacturing sector’s business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Eurozone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current rising geopolitical tension – especially related to Russia/Ukraine – adds uncertainty to still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit the business – and especially consumer confidence – and is likely to lead to some orders being delayed or even canceled, especially large orders.
He said that "more and more it looks like" that the ECB will, of course, have to carry out some sort of quantitative mitigation, "although we suspect it will be limited."
Residents of Mariupol will expose a live chain against the militias
In Mariupol until last week everything was calm - no one dared to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are horribly awaiting the arrival of the “military”.
According to political scientists, separatists break into Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - the city of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which before that was not part of self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupolians decided that the Ukrainian army, although it will defend them, but its forces have a little bit against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and gathered to help the military.
They're pouring down caves, building blockposts and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a live chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and drive equipment and products, collect medicines, publish newspapers.
In the city, shops are gradually closed, banks and ATMs are discontinued.
10 Years of Hell for the Survivors of Beslan: 10 Years of the Horrible Conquest of School as the Children Who Were In It Still Suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial that shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated on death during school atrocities.
Just ten years after the horrific seizure of the Beslan school, during which 334 people were killed, including 186 children, heroically survivors of the disaster warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed like the most extreme possible evil.
The tragedy unites the East and the West in disgust, which then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the conditions of the heaviest grief.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated on the deaths during the school atrocities.
We have discovered amazing young people who have faced hardship, although the memories of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war, which is now threatening Ukraine, in which the same children as they are dying, will now end.
The girl in the photo is trying to get back into the shooting gym.
She was captured in a photo of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when she tried to get back in one lingerie to the shooting gym after the mine exploded.
In frustration, Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larisa, now 40.
There were fears that both of them were killed, but they actually survived.
“The woman told me to run away with all her strength, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and used to go back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was completely recovering, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few slices remain in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people just as doctors helped her.
“This tragedy has changed my life, but of course it hasn’t broken it,” she says with a challenge.
“It happened to me, and you can’t change that fact.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Zera Gapoev, was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and dreamed that we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the capture remains with her, although the memories are a little dimmed every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from the UK and from all over the world.
When I see a picture on the internet, where I’m sitting in a school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn’t happen again.
A boy who ran through a bullet town thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians start school at age 7) and survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her by the hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Escape."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby along the way, grabbed the child by the hand and ran through the city with a bullet.
His father Vladimir, who caught his son outside, said, “Damir told me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in a hospital with wounds on her legs, thinking that her son was dead.
After their reunion, she said, “I was crying with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran away and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now the non-existing News of the World), where he was awarded as a Child Protector by the Barnardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sherry.
“This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it,” he said.
Anyway, I can say that he's squeezing in my memory.
I remember right after that I dropped all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that’s not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who never went out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a toy store where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted, and a ride in an open-top car.
But now he is afraid for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the grief he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,” said Damir, who volunteered at the women’s monastery last week.
I'm trying to help.
I want to serve in the police force someday and hopefully I will be enrolled in the academic academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the terrifying silence immediately after the capture, there were simply no children who would scream and run around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She clearly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to Sherry Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember, when Damir wanted to eat a burqa, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran and played with him.
It was only a month after our nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I think the world hasn't gotten better in 10 years.
Now the war is going on in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just the same kids as ours.
I think for many people war is a news reportage that they listen to when they are bored or when they are busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive or evil.
He does not seek revenge, for example, he is not stuck in this past nightmare.
I know he doesn’t like to remember him, but they’re very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He did not sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damiru is now 17, he's above me, cute, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and stood on my feet, I looked, I saw hell around me, when parts of the bodies lay everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
“I remember screaming to him, ‘Damir, run, run,’ but again I was so sure he didn’t hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
Life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgie Ilin, 17 years old
Boy whose shocking photo after capture became decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: Beslan survivor Georgi Ilin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and right Georgi today
There was a footprint of fear on his bleeding face as he escaped from death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the chief doctor, took him to school on the first day of school before taking his eldest son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of a nightmare,” she recalled.
Not all alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George was able to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is no day when we don’t remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it was long ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time before my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
The photograph of George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized in the sculpture (right).
I remember that George so wanted to go to school that day that he said he wanted to embrace the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of the weeping George in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this photo, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this photo, people from all over the world feel our pain.
George now says, “It’s important that this never happen again.
“I doubt we’ll ever find out the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it was called?
This world is going to something very bad.
“I can’t understand how this happens, because if you ask people, no one wants war, because it happens?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need it to take decades to forget a little bit about it.
It has affected my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had nightmares because of the seizure, but now it's getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That’s why I keep going to this gym before every September 1st.
I want to give a tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won’t forget that, but I don’t feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to become a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn’t allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won’t happen.
Georgi Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived, despite being at the feet of the killer terrorist
Unbelievable: Georgi Farniev was at the feet of the assassin at the time of the seizure, but still managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a killer terrorist.
Actually, it's a miracle that he wasn't killed.
“We think it was yesterday,” said Georgi, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB, but failed due to the damage caused to his health during the seizure.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I’m older now, and they say that children can easily cope with bad things, I have to say that it’s not true.
“In 2006 I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget that.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, for the next year, it was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting on this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgi Farniev today with an open laptop photo of himself in the hospital after the seizure
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for physical fitness, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking normal.
But still my health didn’t allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical records, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals “from cats to cows.”
He said, “I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
It’s not what children need to know, and of course it’s not what they need to survive.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is approaching.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate her.
I know Georgie won't go.
For him, it must be even stronger because he was there and I wasn’t.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan, there's a print on each one.
He stays with us.
George is an adult now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terrible unjust happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knees.
He had several operations, he could walk, but he could not do sports.
I’d say he’s overcame this nightmare by 50%, but it’s impossible to completely overcame and forget it.
This horrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the seizure, and that only aggravates my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and that were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have given me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children are born, but I know widows who have never been married again.
It's hard to assume that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him at the hospital.
Now I'm looking at what's going on in the world - wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it turn out that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If it were possible to capture all the rebels and throw them away as far as possible.
Alyona Tskayeva, 10 years old
A child who was tactfully taken to a safe place by a Special Forces fighter
Rescued: A Russian special force fighter (left) carries Alion Tskaev in a safe place.
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the monster crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when a Russian policeman took the little Alena out of a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Christine and brother Mahara in the school gym.
Mahar, who was three years old at the time, was rescued, but Alonya’s mother and sister were killed in a deadly battle.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and they have a little daughter with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named Kristina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, who is now ten, remembers nothing about catching and has grown into a smart and cheerful girl, neighbors say.
“They’re a big happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both wonderful children,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a wonderful father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Defender Shinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund’s Borussia Dortmund, said he was looking forward to coming back to the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyful event in his career.
Of course, I’m very happy to be playing for Borussia again,” says Bild in the words of Kagava.
I feel very good.
Full of positive emotions and I look forward to coming back to the field in the form of "Borussia".
In the summer of 2012, Kagava moved to MY from Borussia for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 million.
However, he has never been able to join the English club, having played only 38 games in the English Championship for two seasons, scoring 6 balls and giving 8 successful transfers.
Man accused of riding a girl on a pedestrian "pelican" crossing in Fifa
A 78-year-old man will appear in court on charges of riding a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian "Pelican" crossing in Fifa.
Gordon Stewart allegedly shot the girl on a move to Pittsburgh in East New York.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stewart drove his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and shot the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruter, denied his guilt in Dundee's sheriff's court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the Royal Attorney, has appointed a court date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not open in Vladivostok
The duty-free store Duty Free Airport of Vladivostok has issued a banner banning shopping in this store to a number of world political leaders.
Do not boil them with spirits, vodka and cognac.
The store administration has decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other well-known comrades will not be able to cook vodka, cognac and their spirits.
And I hung up the corresponding table on the door.
Earlier, Obama had been banned from appearing in an even less accessible institution of the kind of service - Dietician desk MGU, according to the website of the general public.
It is not known whether the American president has ever dreamed of eating at a diet table in Russia, but the authors of the bans clearly seem to themselves terribly clever.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to agrarians
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that in the context of the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies to set up the production of the cheese varieties in demand from buyers.
The advice was given during the visit of the company "Yugpticeprom" company "Agrocomplex".
The head of government also advised restaurants to reorient themselves to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the proper level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been introduced in Russia since August 7.
The head coach of Russia Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted training for the competitions.
Our athletes performed at their level, - says "All sports" Maslakov.
Thirdly, the confirmation of our sufficiently high command level.
It is good that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It is important to note that we are not prepared for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not committed our leaders to taking part in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we have become second in this tournament, but this season we have renewed the team.
The French, on the other hand, exhibited a combatable team, consisting of 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intentions to win this year, which they have repeatedly publicly announced.
But even such a composition of the hosts of the competitions could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians have performed in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some sorts were relatively lower than in the same "Brilliant League".
Season's over.
Of course, athletes are no longer as important as the result, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, there was an absurdity when at 1,500 m men were so passionate about the tactical tricks of running that showed the result below the average... female runs.
4 tips on how to get the best quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take a picture or take a video underwater, there are a number of options for your device.
The cheapest option is a waterproof "washer", for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, for example, the GoPro Hero3<0x2B> Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about <0x24>300.
I took these photos on a family holiday with a few cameras, all for about <0x24>350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to get the best results.
Check out your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other offices are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you’re going to take.
Some photo and video cameras have shooting modes or object type that optimize exposure for dark underwater conditions.
And before jumping into the water, find out how deep your device can fall.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our buyer guide and ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots – because many of them won’t.
The “mustles” have LCDs that will help you compute photos, while the action cameras usually don’t have them.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to view underwater, and the frame layout will be a random process.
So make a few frames.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode that captures several frames with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light is significantly reduced the deeper you dive underwater.
If possible, stay on the surface when you’re shooting in a pool, river, or ocean.
This will also allow you to pass more color on the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Swim closer to the shooting objects.
This is a great tip for shooting on land, but it is even more important underwater due to dark light conditions.
Especially important if you’re shooting on an action camera: This device is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you’ll have to approach the shooting objects if you want to fill the frame.
Bronze medalist at the 2012 Olympics for the free fight Billal Mahov can switch to the Greco-Roman fight.
This was reported by the head coach of the Dagestan team in the free fight Sazhid Sazhidov.
The specialist did not exclude the athlete's participation in the World Cup in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Billal Mahov is in the collection of the team of "classics", - says "R-Sport" words of Sazhid Sazhidov.
In general, according to the juniors, Billal performed in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championships, he became the winner of the freelance tournament and the third prize in the Greco-Roman competitions and decided to focus on the free fight.
There has long been talks that a new phase of his career will carry our heavyweight in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I’ll say more: Mahov can play at the World Cup in Tashkent – if he wins a kick.
But the decisive word is always behind the coaching staff headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was such a person whose personality strength could shake all around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
As a consultant anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to riding patients of both the suffering of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among those who turned to him, his wife recalled, was a MI-6 officer, who had to live with devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors are passionate about diagnosis and disease, those who are undergoing treatment mainly worry about something completely different — pain.
One day in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who began to suffer.
“I didn’t feel like I used to,” he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Fighting flu-like symptoms, he finds that he is irritated by his wife, Juliet.
“I want everything to happen faster, not later,” he said.
When Juliet left for business for a week, Lawson found that he was unusual and unclear why he was upset.
There was something wrong.
He asked his colleague to make a chest X-ray.
Two weeks earlier, he skied in the French Alps.
X-ray results have arrived.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lung envelope.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But with mesothelioma it's different.
Almost in all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a fiber building material that was once called a "miracle", but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that you may not pay attention to.
Asbestos, after all, is the material of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked in close contact with it: pipe insulators, builders, tankers and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems to be a cause for concern today.
But such tranquility is wrong.
Britain, it turns out, is at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
There are more people dying of mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death toll of approximately 2,500, more than twice as many people die from this disease than as a result of car accidents.
Annual number of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and estimated number of future deaths in the UK
The reason why we feel its deadly consequences now is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), the development of mesothelioma usually takes decades.
And attacking mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction specialties.
Asbestos has been, and often remains, in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, grade, profession or age.
The bastions of elegance, from London’s fashionable stores to private schools, turned out to be no salvation.
The building of the parliament is infested with asbestos.
Even the hospitals designed to treat us were the reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a pipe insulator.
Actually, he had to think about where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
“It looks like there could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Gaia Hospital, where I spent six years in internships,” he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and truckers - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my colleagues have the same disease?
This was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who were in Gaia hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I was the only one who survived."
How many of us are infected with this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17, he was 55 years old.
It's unusual to live so long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
So, now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us get the same disease?"
According to the UK’s leading mesothelioma expert, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is supposed to survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don’t know they’re going to die that way.

A quick review of reports from the courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the attack of mesothelioma has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janes Ellen had been unwittingly exposed to asbestos.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading clothing departments in two facilities, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't have imagined it would have touched me.
Few people know a lot about asbestos.
Basically, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They got their name from the word "asbestiforms", which means a fiber structure that communicates strength and flexibility to them.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotil, widely known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, outdoor tiles, thermal insulation pipes, boiler seams, even in car brake pads.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of health damage" that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
The UK was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are subtle, albeit indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the extremely high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK]."

Janes Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Pito suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a patient study, which suggests that "a substantial percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known impact on work or at home, was most likely caused by environmental exposure to asbestos."
Much of this impact, he says, is due to “usual use and the impact of weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which looked at the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even in the very center of the government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines behind the chambers of parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could have been brought into motion by something as harmless as "strong air flows".
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems to be the opposite.
Although the Directorate of Technical Services of the Parliament may not have insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "pure sanitary certificate", it has now admitted that it is necessary to carry out work on the <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion to rebuild the Parliament of the year, to improve the electricity, and to remove all of it.
The Goddard report noted that "the situation with asbestos was not governed according to different rules."
It is impossible to know if this error will be worth living.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who has never been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital that successfully filed asbestos-related claims,” he says, “But I can’t prove that in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places where I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of surgery late in the evening.
All of a sudden I started to have a fever.
It started very quickly.
I felt awful.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming from the pleura, the shell around the lungs.
However, like Janes Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect the hostage.
Eventually, he couldn’t go to work for a month.
The tasked doctors took X-rays of the chest cell and put pleural catheters to extract fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.
However, his condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually, his health improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time the same symptoms came back, often after he did sports and breathed hard.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him in a reception room with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
Eventually, his patient was dozens of years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and the doctor who advised him showed his CT results and X-rays to a group of specialists.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into a hole between the envelope of his chest and the envelope of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just go on,” he says.
I didn’t worry too much about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and the New Year: “I was told it was a mesotelioma.”
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott suddenly sank into a meeting with the Macmillan nurses, one of whom offered him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“It turns out, asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there has been quite often asbestos insulation on pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people of atypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be injured.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson), or ate in the basement (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to toxic substances.
For several decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were a place where, in theory, they saved lives for patients, but a place that was a life-threatening place for the doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Students installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos racks
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its amazing insulation and fire-resistant properties.
Schools too.
Actually, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the class for the first time.
Across the country, at countless chemistry lessons, schoolchildren installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos shelves.
There have been websites that focus on the problem of asbestos in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, harmless things like outdoor tiles or rooftops usually contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison that’s placed in a huge number of our buildings,” said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Gaia Hospital.
In one case, the only contact the sick woman could remember was the removal of the garden cottage in the 1970s.
Be careful, therefore, to keep your gardens clean.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is huge.
“It takes a lot of time to realize that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to go and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not seeing Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of the doctor to the position of the patient.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he remembers how he was knocked down with so much information that he had to take.
“It was hard to understand everything,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have?’
They gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not seeing Christmas anymore.
That's all."
Mesotelioma is especially dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we support life — the act of breathing itself — that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and the fibers are inhaled, they can cling to the pleura, the lung shell.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem arises from inhalation of needle fibers of asbestos,” Professor Tom Treger, a cardiac surgeon who arrived at the hospital in 2001.
It was the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading center for mesothelioma treatment.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely exposed to the effects of internships in the hospital.
When asbestos needles enter the lung tissue, Tresher says, "breathing pushes them to the periphery where the shell is located.
This is an invasive process from the very beginning.
Common treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, causes hot controversy.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
Treasurer disagrees.
"It's impossible to cut the pleura," he says.
It is impossible to walk around with a knife.
In the meantime, this cancer "doesn't very well undergo chemotherapy" which "acts" but does not cure.
“Sometimes there are patients who live long,” Tresher says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live a lot, much longer than expected.
Writer Steven J. Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after being diagnosed, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he had mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after being diagnosed, became a support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said happily when they called.
“He was very positive,” Abbott says.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he is still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life for just one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, “did not give everything a little more positive color.”
After meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loik Lang-Lazdunski, a professor of thoracic surgery at Gaia Hospital.
“We had the advantage that I didn’t need directions, I just called them, and they accepted me,” admits Graham.
The average patient would have to get direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best of the available types of treatment.
However, when such treatment is ultimately inevitably ineffective, many patients are faced with another financial cause for concern - about the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they turn to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898,” says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small amounts could be at risk for health.
That’s when we talked about the dishonesty of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and Gaia Hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn’t a “full-cost settlement,” according to Morgan, as Lawson could not unambiguously prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Gaia Hospital.
After investigating his death, a spokesman for Gaia Hospital confirmed, however, that "asbestos in the basement premises concerned was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Actually, binding deadly contact with asbestos to one company or workplace – usually decades later – was a major problem for mesothelioma patients requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers either changed owners or closed down.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against the lawsuits know that on their side there is no time for the plaintiffs, of course.
In response this year, serious new legislation was issued, which facilitates the process of seeking compensation for mesothelioma patients, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under this law, a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund fund fund funded by the insurance industry was established for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but who can not be judged.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary case of compensation - about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million is a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
“This is a deal written by insurers for insurers,” he says, suggesting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if there were no interfering with the temporary interval and patients with mesothelioma could track the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was "imperfect".
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that, with seven people dying every day, rapid action was needed.
“People are suffering so much, and they need help today,” Penning said during Bill’s second reading on the retaliation in December last year.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loik Lang-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After primary consultations Lange-Lazdunski recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Trezher, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy – a tritherapy in which Lange-Lazdunski can boast about 40 percent of patients who survived in five years.
Abbott felt a tide of strength.
“This is, of course, one of the most important things,” Abbott says.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is a force that supports you.
When you give up, the condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott was undergoing surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he completed the last of six chemotherapy cycles.
Subsequent scans did not show any trace of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.
I just had to be 50.
It's not life-threatening.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There's no more trace of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things — about finance when I die, for example, or what you have to show your wife how a timer works at a boiler.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
We need to look forward.
Like Ellie's 16-year-old father, and Tamzine's 14-year-old, it's not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease, which means I won’t live until old age.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzine is very sociable and energetic.
She told all of her friends, and many of us called very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced with hope, even a slight chance of survival.
This disease brings with it (even as, in the end, for Steven Jay Gould) a dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not a life-threatening condition.
The bodies of the embalmed pharaohs are twisted into asbestos tissues.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen the pot and increase heat resistance.
The Elder describes asbestos.
Now a canvas has been invented that does not ignite.
I saw the napkins made of it splashing in the fireplace at the banquets.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used for making paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa and soon thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the perfect heat insulator for steam engines and industrial revolution turbines.
World production of asbestos grows to more than 30,000 tons a year.
Prudential’s statistics reveal premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and who are consequently denied life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw is dying in Rochedale.
Dr. William Cook states that the particles of asbestos in her lungs “were, without a doubt, the main cause of death.”
This is the first case of this kind.
Kershaw’s employers, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
Compensation is not paid.
During World War II, shipbuilding is developing intensively, one of the deadliest occupations in terms of contact with asbestos.
Voluntary industrial ban on imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful lawsuit for health damage caused by contact with asbestos in the UK.
World production of asbestos grows to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tons.
The UK’s Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety requires all contractors working with asbestos to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The mesothelioma act was adopted in the UK.
A <0xC2><0xA3>350 million compensation scheme has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear revenge
China's parliament on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to set the stage for long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists began planning and mobilization hours after the statement.
The decision of the All-China People’s Assembly, in essence, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It has not deceiving our expectations, but it still drives anger," said Democratic Party president Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And obviously we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China’s decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Permanent Committee of the All-China People’s Assembly, said that allowing the general public to run for Hong Kong’s presidential election would be too “chaotic.”
Since 1997, when the UK handed over control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the region’s residents to vote for the head of government, starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented the decision adopted on Sunday as a democratic step forward as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands, with the help of a committee.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision was made after the summer, when some of Hong Kong’s largest and most widespread protests took place over the years.
Much of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy campaign is behind the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to shut down Hong Kong’s financial district if Beijing does not guarantee its universal right to vote.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the statement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement is moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they will rise on the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with the state authorities.
In an online application, the organizers said the movement "considered the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other option.
We are very sorry to announce that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the capture of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and security measures have been strengthened at the government's headquarters on Sunday with police and barricades.
The root of the unrest lies in the feeling that many in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put business at risk – a source of Hong Kong’s vitality.
“The protest they’re talking about can cause great economic damage depending on how many people will be involved and how long,” said lawmaker Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don’t want to worry about Hong Kong getting out of control.
This is an idea that is detrimental to investment.
Chinese state media have also reported in recent days that Hong Kong’s Democratic Movement activists have been shown to be distracted by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the right to vote, which attracted 780,000 participants – more than one-fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
The American culture of graduation scores reaches university life: first-class students were offered to arrive on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to such a demand by launching the UK’s first “luxury” travel service for current students.
To leave a bright impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a personal plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said that the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to take their stuff across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping this year’s students reach the university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
A representative of the company said that since this service has just been launched, orders have not yet been placed, but added that "students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks".
The company also said that despite the fact that students have to pay <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 a year for training, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make an excellent first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students has criticized this service as detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS Vice President of Higher Education, said: “This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many students, who will start studying at the university this month, face a cost-of-living crisis when available financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the fast-growing expenses on the basic needs of the general needs before they can just start thinking about it.
Feminists raise the question of racial belongings and police behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri earlier this month.
They raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they wait in a row before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peres noticed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender above racial affiliation when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Middle West rose and attracted national attention, Peres saw responses from white women who focused 100 percent on racial affiliation.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9 murder, personal essays with titles such as "the thoughts of Ferguson from the face of a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Peres, they have shown a significant shift.
“In feminism, I don’t think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level,” she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis we faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so attached to racial affiliation, they felt that it needs to be pointed out.
For a professor of English at Ohio State University, Mitchell Ferguson has discovered problems that black Americans face every day, but that are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.
“I can write something funny on Facebook about what’s going on with me and my partner, and I’ll get 150 likes from everywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about how colorful people are being attacked in their own country, silence is deaf.
“Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public sphere?” she asks.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender, and sexuality issues in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between racial issues and gender issues.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine racial and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hettery, a professor of women’s and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and this almost always served as the basis for the rape of a white woman,” said Heather.
I needed a white woman confirming the story to justify the lynching.
From Heather's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for electorate would be effective only for one of the groups: women black or black.
“They decided to put all the eggs in the voting rights basket for women, and the voting rights for black people should have appeared later,” Hetty said.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear idea of why colorful women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching in the Southern Women’s Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
This group emerged nearly 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell’s point of view, the rise of white feminists’ reactions to the problems raised by the Ferguson situation – police behavior, racial discrimination – reflects a time when white feminists had to “adapt” the problems that black women could not cope with.
“It would be great if activists who have such a [traditional feminist] ideology would take the right to raise a child as seriously as they treat the right to contraception,” Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second wave, who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what this means.
White feminist activist Gloria Stein, two weeks after Michael Brown’s murder, took advantage of Facebook and published a sharp columnist article by Guardian Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans take more part in the race.
"I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the dangers in the body - and the views on racial issues that differ significantly in public polls - will be at the forefront of change," Stein wrote.
Although Steinem is in charge of more cross-sectional feminism, which involves both racial and gender issues, her comments on race in America still amaze some.
A researcher at the American Entrepreneurial Institute, Christina Summers, author of Who Stole Feminism, said She The People that young men in the United States, especially colorful young people, "are much more vulnerable to witchcraft than their sisters," but the remarks are against Stone of Ferguson.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, “Watch My Brother” to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking youths, followed an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that promotes the advanced line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested about 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, immigration reform has come to the surface again – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present this issue as important to women, she only needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
“They speak for themselves,” said Mercado.
When the overwhelming majority of workers’ visas are issued to [male immigrants], women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories find a response in women’s organizations,” she said.
Ipswich house "with pig" for sale
A photo of the house on sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out that it was depicted as a large pig resting in the living room.
Set for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120000, a separate one-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
A detailed description was a photo of the living room of the house - on which was depicted a pig with a head resting on the sofa.
The Connells real estate agency reported that the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was posted by mistake and has already been removed," the company's spokeswoman said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as "a unique single-bedroom house."
Despite the fact that the agency removed the photo from its website, it is still retained in the advertising material.
The sale of the house has sparked interest in social media, where some have asked if the pig is being sold together with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the game of the fourth round of the US Open surrendering Karolin Voznyatsky, believes she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to decently finish the year and try to reach a new level, reports Vasily OSIPOV from New York.
How would you rate your results in the Big Helmet tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I managed to win Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I didn’t have enough stability, especially at the end of some games.
Right now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn’t even reach the quarter-finals.
What challenges do you face before the end of the season?
“After the offensive defeat, I have a huge motivation to get to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I’m going to do everything I can to finish the year well.
The Asian series of tournaments starts in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Duma’s Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former World Champion Nikolai Valuev proposed to give bonuses upon admission to university for compliance with GTO standards.
According to him, in general, the norms will be the same as in Soviet times - people will give the norms for pulling, running and other exercises.
Remember, 12 Russian entities will begin to implement the GTO standards from September 1 on their territory.
I also offered students who gave the GTO, to give bonuses upon enrollment in college, - noted Valuev.
For example, they can add a little points to EGE.
There are also suggestions to give additional weekend workers of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
In Harvey, South Wales, a new millionaire emerged after winning the lottery
The Harvey lottery player this month.
A new millionaire is being searched in the southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will take home nearly <0x24>1.1 million from the lottery game on Saturday night.
The newspaper kiosk in Harvey brings gold in the main prize draw for the second time in five years, the previous win amounted to <0x24>1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to declare himself.
Store owner Steve Forward said that the win caused a riot in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.

The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said the Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov at the roundtable, which held "Vedomosti" at the Moscow Motor Show - 2014.
The plan is prepared by the government, one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September - early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures concerning electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of vehicles on gas-powered fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (copy is available at "Vedomostej") is planned for 2014-2017.
It is necessary to develop criteria for evaluating electric and hybrid transport and to decide how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; a scheme of preferential lending and leasing will appear by April 2015; and proposals to lower the price of cars will be developed.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to make changes to regulatory acts to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, auto-fuel stations, etc.).
In addition, during 2015, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for the regional authorities to also stimulate the use of environmentally friendly transport – in the form of providing it with advantages in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 – and proposals for expansion.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include in the list of performance assessment indicators of regional authorities criteria reflecting the effectiveness of supporting the production of environmentally friendly transport and the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric cars in Russia is only forming – in 2013, around 100 electric cars were sold throughout the country.
In early 2014, the import duty on electric cars was lifted, so sales will be about 500 pieces, predicts Mitsubishi Motors chief executive officer in Russia Andrey Pankov.
But even the five-fold growth does not make electric cars noticeable: in 2013, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million passenger and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric cars to Russia.
To start imports is being prepared by Renault - the company is primarily focused on corporate customers, says Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships of Renault in Russia Nikolai Remiz.
Most of the other electric transport producers have taken a stand-alone position with regard to Russia.
There are also developments of electric cars by Russian manufacturers - "", GAZ, "", but the production is poor.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to ASM-Holding, "AvtoVAZ" released 30 electric cars.
The demand is low due to the cost of electric vehicles, acknowledges the director of "AutoVAZ" in engineering Sergei Amanov, without the state support of the breakthrough in this segment will not be.
The development of the Russian market of electric cars in addition to expensive cars (the electric cars sold in Russia, on average twice the cost of analogues with internal combustion engines) prevents the underdevelopment of the loading infrastructure (fuel - "units of fuel").
Due to the high-cost and low rate of reduction of the cost of electric vehicles in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the editor-in-chief of "Avtorov" Mikhail Podorozhansky, Celikov agrees with him.
Car manufacturers, on the contrary, say that some models of electric cars are already close to the cost of conventional cars.
The Russian electric car market has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "electricity" is real; this will in particular contribute to the emergence of all new charging stations, emphasizes BMW Group President in Russia Wolfgang Shlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by the state-owned company "Rosneti": several stations have been built in Moscow, soon there will be about 80 more.
Negotiations on the construction of a gasoline network are also being held with other regions.
According to the director of the Russian networks, Vladimir Sophiin, the company believes in the electric car market and is ready to build tanks all over the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric cars of various brands.
In addition, "Rosnets" as a network company do not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, the ability to do so with regard to charging electric vehicles is being developed.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of state support for the formation in Russia of the market of electric cars the renewal of customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension is being explored, the extension of the preferential list.
Replacement of the transport tax by environmental (the idea is discussed and applies to all cars) also supports the market, but not as sensitive as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the tax cuts led to a sharp increase in sales of electric cars – now account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, there is also a need for stimulating measures for car owners, such as free parking in the center of the city (as already done in Moscow), Pankov assured, or the possibility of moving electric cars on selected tracks, which in Russia is not yet.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
A single-engine Piper PA-46 crashed in Colorado.
Three out of five people in it have been killed, ITAR-TASS reports.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred within a few kilometers of the take-off and landing track of Denver airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being identified.
In the Donetsk region, the prisoners of the Donbass battalion are dealt with.
The caravans were surrounded by Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of policemen were killed in the shooting.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation was really in southeastern Ukraine, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky ones.
The caraters from the Donbass battalion survived the "meat squad" in which they fell under Ilovaisk.
In the vicinity of the army of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the militants spent several days, actually abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When it was reported from the headquarters that it was possible to get out of the "ring" along the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But literally a few minutes later, shells and bullets came from all sides.
"According to the information given to me, we had a corridor, we were allowed out," said the deputy commander of the battalion, who had the invokable Lermontov.
And when we landed between Multipol and Chervonoselsky, a crossfire began with anti-tank missiles, guns, 30-mm grenades, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three in the back, and in the end there were only two cars left.
The officer with the caller "Lermontov" says: almost immediately at least 60 people died, dozens were injured, many died later.
The surviving militants are now being given medical care to those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give food, medicines.
At the same time, their own commanders actually deceived them and sentenced them to death.
They have betrayed us, they say.
Column, the whole battalion to destroy it.
In the Donbass battalion, like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered, because in the Ukrainian news stories were told about the atrocities allegedly committed in the south-east "separatists".
Alexey has already seen a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Lugansk, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me and told me that there was a gunshot, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
After that, I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not released from Ilovaisk, we were told we were in the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, I've already written a report on the departure.
We were immediately taken to Ilovaisk with the congregations of Zurahovo.
According to the inmates, in the "cattle" under Ilovaisk a man was trapped 300-350.
Now some survivors admit that if time could be turned back, they would not have joined the punitive battalion for anything.
All the detainees were handed over to the DNR.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.

News Economy - Will Kiev "Rosneft" Replace <0x24>140 Million in Losses?
The head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, said that the company estimates the damage from the shooting of the Lisychan NPP in Ukraine at <0x24>140 million.
He said this in an interview with Spiegel.

“There were no battles, there were no ‘insurgencies’, but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, the technological oil floating in the pipelines has disappeared,” he said.
On July 18, in connection with the shooting of the Lisychan NPR, the tank for oil storage burned and the building of the two warehouses was destroyed.
The Lisychan Oil Plant is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first of the enterprise was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisychan Oil Plant is about 7 million tons of crude oil per year.
The plant is able to produce fuel of the standard "Euro-4", as well as the batch of diesel of the standard "Euro-5".
In March 2012, the supply of oil to the Lisychan Oil Plant was suspended due to its loss.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, "Rosneft" received the Lisychan NPP together with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-VR.

Twitter is trying to be more interesting for new users
Twitter’s microblogging service has changed the user registration process to get new participants involved in active interaction with the platform faster.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
Now, new Twitter users will be browsing a large number of accounts recommended by the service during registration to immediately compile their reading circle.
Recommendations are drawn up on the basis of the interests indicated when registering.
At the same time, Twitter automatically sets a subscription cookie for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to manually remove cookies in order not to read those who are not interested in him.
If users of the microblogging service had previously seen only avatars of recommended users, then now Twitter is taking a sample of one of the blogger’s popular tweets to help make an impression on the person.
This is the biggest change in Twitter’s registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been actively working on upgrading the service.
Such activity is primarily associated with the ongoing efforts of the service to achieve the innocence.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a decline in readers’ activity.
At the moment, the company desperately needs more loyal consumers’ resources, which, once in a while, would stay for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.

The car recycling program resumed from September 1st.
From 1 September in Russia, the program for the recycling of cars is resumed.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As explained the head of the Ministry of Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits, which have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other support areas.
The program will affect all cars over six years of age.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand per passenger car to 350 thousand rubles per cargo.
Earlier in Russia, such a program of car recycling was already in place.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that it is now envisaged not only the recycling of machines to get a subsequent discount, but also the possibility in case if the car has reached the age of more than six years, to acquire a new XS with a discount.
More than 16 billion rubles have been spent on the previous federal recycling program, which ran from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 was about 1.2 million (this plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nicky Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator, decided to release the game about modern journalism.
He told about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case began working on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact has only now gained widespread popularity.
The inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where the protests are now taking place, which began after a policeman killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be how the information illumination of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes between the police and the population take place.
The hero can take different photographs of what is happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene in such a way that the police will look like heroes, and the protesters are bandits, the police will start treating him better and letting him go where the ordinary man can’t go.
If he would shed light on events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a large-scale uprising.
Points in the game will need to be collected with the help of a Twitter character, in which new subscribers will appear, if the photos displayed there will be popular.
The game has no name yet.
The date of release and the platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image demonstrating how the event may change depending on how the photo about it was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Case, he explained that he had been considering the concept of such a game quite a long time ago, but initially wanted to devote it not to protests in the US, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to illuminate the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media illuminating the events in Ferguson, he decided to make the game based on the motives of what happened.
Nicky Case is an independent developer who releases browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about the events from Case’s biography, is about how a bisexual teenager tries to tell about his relationships with homophobic parents.
Geletey draws Ukraine into continuation of bloodshed
Calling to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims, the defense minister of Ukraine Valery Geletey urges the people to continue the bloody confrontation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation said in a statement.
“In Moscow, of course, we drew attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military ministry Valery Geletey, who declared the “completion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from the terrorists” and the start of the “Great War”, in which the “losses” will be counted.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who posted the post mentioned on his page on Facebook, is a subject for the study of specialists not in the military field," - said in a statement of Russian diplomats.
They hardly believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “On unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that in the event of continued resistance they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
At the same time, he said that the "operation to liberate the east of Ukraine" was completed.

We're going to Richmond and hopefully we'll get better there.
Stewart first crashed into the wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Bush, requiring repair to the right side of his car.
"I started today with quite a lot of hopes of getting to the finish line," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was plunged into the evacuator, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car crashed and killed another driver during a race on the ground track in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week, and he needed to win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to participate in the Persecution.

The Army Controls the New Government of Thailand
General Prayut (left) appointed Minister of Defence Right Wongsuwan (left)
Thailand’s military governor and prime minister, General Prayut Chan-Ocha, has announced the composition of a new cabinet of ministers, in which more than a third of the posts are held by generals or resigned generals.
Representatives of the army were given key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
Praut Chan-Ocha was officially approved as prime minister on Monday after the king of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
The 60-year-old soldier, who took power in the country as a result of the bloodless coup of May 22, was the only candidate for prime ministerial office.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
Earlier, the army had appointed MPs.
According to Prauta Chan-Och, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat.
Praut Chan-Ocha will be the interim prime minister as the military plans to hold general elections in late 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to strengthen their power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22.
against the background of total paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily detained.
Immediately after the military came to power, they were temporarily arrested by the country’s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yingliq Chinawat.
Several journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is rooted in 2006, when the army displaced Yinglyk Chinawat Taxin as prime minister.
Both of them enjoy popularity among the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has repeatedly given them success in elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital elite have joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one has ever said that the salad will be better, I have not promised you that, says the waitress from the new Palm Brasserie.
It has to be formally acknowledged that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain unchanged.
After all, everyone knows for a long time: we say "Belgium" - we mean media, we say "media" - we mean "Belgium".
Restaurants like to make a profound statement that the success of an institution depends on three factors: it’s location, location, and once again location.
There are such places that are not located to be good, but even excellent, but some unlucky.
Shortly after sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a café "Horodok" (in honor of the same television show), then "Odessa-mama", and also the restaurant "Bojole" and beer "Friendship".
Now there is again a beer, but no longer a nostalgic-soviet, but a Belgian.
Above the ground was placed only the top of the iceberg: a bar stand and a pair of tables, all the rest of the space is deprived of even a hint of sunlight.
But it's fun here, as in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows - TVs, where the girls float.
The Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg have not been new for a long time, so there is something to compare with.
Here are eight types of spilled beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 l) and an innumerable number of bottles (170-1550 rubles).
A company-positive waitress presents a menu fun, telling that "media - saturated large seeds", and it should be noted: it is the service, despite individual flaws, - the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected for the content, but often very unexpected for the performance.
Well, who, for example, is given to predict that the meat roulette with the Walloon blackberry (280 rubles) - in fact carpuccio, cut in addition so thin that the parchment paper compared to it will appear to be the material immeasurably thick.
You can feel at least some taste only if you scrape the half plate together.
Salads are even worse.
Classical Liege (260) would be best recognized as a crime against the Belgian people: some crappy iceberg, baked a long time ago potato, sour Kenyan beans, canned chips from bacon plus mastolu-chez.
You don't want to meet anyone with such a Liège salad!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partially different, but the impression was also not different from the positive.
If it was still possible to close your eyes to an undisciplined quarter of cherry tomatoes or roasted champignons, then why do the media look like they have been able to defrost and boil them several times in their lives?
I already know: there are quite normal belomori media here!
They are served in pots "in sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, the one from white wine, celery and carrots, was frankly not given.
There are vegetables, and the smell is absent, and if there was wine there, it remains a mystery.
But good depend on the media fries with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken water here is not a sandwich, so dense that depending on the mood you can decide, the first or second dish in front of you, but just a pleasant butter dish.
It was stated that the rabbit local cook cooks in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
On the cover, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: the rosemary silenced everything.
It seemed that this rabbit was fed exclusively with rosemary bushes during his life, which is why the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time to the leg of the rabbit was attached a wonderful - no, just a cancelled gravel in a caramelized short.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also saturated - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The clay sauce turned out to be excessively watery, and the waffles were dried.
But approaching the table, the manager was very informally interested in the lunch impressions.
So you should come back again.
The exchange rate of the dollar rose on the IMF above 37 rubles on news of the West preparing for new sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar calculated "tomorrow" at 10:29 msk grew by 26.9 kopecks and was 37.02 rubles, the rate of the euro rose by 30 kopecks - to 48.73 rubles, data from the Moscow Stock Exchange indicates.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 cents to the level of the previous closure and was worth 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached its peak on 19 February 2009 - then it was worth 36.43 rubles, and on 3 March 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House said U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, both in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast predicted this sign, - says senior analyst "Alpari" Anna Bodova.
Anything related to Ukraine will, in one way or another, be reflected in the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumors about the invasion of troops have not been confirmed by any side, but the market proved very emotional.
All talks that he was resistant to such news were overturned yesterday.
The week, according to the forecast of the specialist, will close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of transit of gas through Ukraine - all these are joints of one chain.
Inflation is also predicted: current prices for the fall will increase from 5 to 10%.
Soon, too, seasonal vegetables and fruits will end, and some vacuum will come while the networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
"The dollar approached the mark at 37 rubles, passed it and returned, there is no powerful hysteria," commented the head of the market analysis department "Open Broker" Konstantin Bushuyev.
They will still be looking to see if the promised sanctions will be introduced on Saturday as NATO will meet.
The ruble, he said, sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, then sent news about Ukraine, in addition, last week the ECB said that by the end of the year it completely switched to the floating rate and refused any foreign exchange interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was nothing different from the previous during this month, everyone was frightened by the mark of 37 rubles, - the analyst continues.
So, in terms of traffic, nothing bad has happened.
The worrying times for the currency market were, I recall, when at the end of January there was increased demand for currency, as well as March 3, when the central bank sent a record amount of currency.
In UFS IC also see the positive side of the ruble weakening.
First of all, this is the growth of the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as the increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the cost of imports, says UFS IC chief analyst Alexey Kozlov.
Negative points can be attributed to the travel of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, provoke the rise of inflationary pressure and, as a result, become the cause of the cost of borrowing money, which in turn hinders development.
Speaking of the stock market, depreciation of the ruble slightly smoothens the decrease in the price of the shares, expressed in rubles.
For example, the MMVB index declined by 1.67% during Thursday’s trade, and the RTS index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of the index decline is due to the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is due to the massive desire to buy a currency.
As practice shows, gradually the emotions come to nothing, and the quotes of the ruble partially or completely restore the lost positions.
"We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," - notes Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic impairment is often misdiagnosed
The British woman said she had spent many years thinking that she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Karen Rogers spent most of her adolescence thinking that she had only lived for a few years after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Sharko-Mari-Tuta disease (SMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that lead to damage to nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
The charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosed is a common problem among people with SMT because so little is known about this condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have SMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, uncertain walking, and squeezed toes.
Patients may feel dizziness or pain, and the condition is not cured and progresses, which means that the symptoms intensify over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Frederick's (AF) attack, a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she was going to be in a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she would die before she turned 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do what others did.
I fell down every day, and it took me more time.
I could never ride a rollercoaster or skateboard with other kids, and I had a lot of fun at school because I was walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release her Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at the medical card when her doctor left the room, and it was written that she had AF.
“I felt guilty because I pushed my nose to a wrong place, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library, and wrote to the AF Association,” she said.
When I got the information in response, I was shocked and panicked as much as possible.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turn 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in the meantime.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funerals.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she realized that her ability to walk did not deteriorate as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me, and said, "Dearest, I don't think you have this disease because you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you've got something that's a lot less life-threatening.
After a few genetic examinations, she was found to have MST.
“When he explained what the SMT was, I thought I had a happy ticket,” she said.
The UK SMT charity has announced a month of information about SMT to try to draw attention to the disease.
The tax burden on entrepreneurs in the Washington area is growing as the economy recovers
The rebounding economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country increased moderately last year, as the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia combined paid <0x24>27.6 billion in state and local cash in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from the <0x24>26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on business by state and local level increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to <0x24>671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth in 2009 and 2010.
Taxes charged by the state grew 4.3 percent faster than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by the professional service company, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county’s tax revenue, 56 per cent, is taxed on entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland’s tax revenue is on firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the lowest amount of tax revenue, proportionately, from entrepreneurs.
The increase in tax revenues is largely due to a return to the previous value of real estate companies, researchers say, which raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years, when growth was less than 1 percent.
While a large proportion of these revenues come from large states such as California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same is happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia paid <0x24>10 billion in federal and local property taxes last year, <0x24>9.6 billion more than in 2012, a 4.2 percent increase compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return on property value has no similar effect on the growth of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes are barely more than one-fifth of the company’s tax bills.
Virginia and District of Columbia companies pay about half of their state and local tax bills in the form of real estate taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their property, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or a non-profit organization that doesn't pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, a spokesman for the Department of Real Estate.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay the same services as there are in other states.
The recent growth in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
The income of entrepreneurs also seems to be undergoing adjustments, according to this data.
Companies in the region declared a state-level corporate income tax of <0x24>2.3 billion, by <0x24>2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has raised <0x24>1 billion in corporate income tax, the largest in the region.
Although trends are directed in one direction, the tax burden for entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three areas.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the national average, 4.3 per cent, while in Maryland it was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues have risen below the average of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax in three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) equal to 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the county it is relatively high - 9,975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that in Virginia, taxation is lower for entrepreneurs by state and local level and, in general, a more favorable climate in terms of taxation for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbor from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law that lowers the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, just like in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve tax revenue targets next year, this law could bring an income tax rate of up to 3 percent for entrepreneurs by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to feel better and thus pay more taxes on the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners - the transitional structure that most small firms are set up - in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, the prevalence for the entire state of Maryland, increased by 20 percent from <0x24>2 per cent last year to last year.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business tax revenues across the country is likely to continue this year, with revenues from tax revenues from state and local governments rising 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period.
However, the Washington area may be delayed as the reduction in federal spending affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home world judo championship has won Russia two silver and seven bronze prizes.
According to this indicator, the Russians gave up only the main favorite of the competition - the team of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who performed in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the equal final fight against Boldbaatar Ghanbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation resolved only one remark received by the Russians.
But the second day of the tournament became the most successful for the Russian team - on Tuesday, three medals were won at once.
In men's competitions in the category up to 66 kg of silver was obtained by Mikhail Pulyaev, and bronze - Kamal Khan-Mahomedov.
In the final match, the Russians surrendered the 2011 and 2013 World Championships to the Japanese Masashi Ebinum.
Han-Magomedov, who lost the compatriot in the quarter-finals, won the comforting tournament and became the bronze prize winner.
In the women's tournament category up to 52 kg also to the third stage of the pedestal of honor was achieved by Natalia Kusutin.
In the semi-finals, she lost to current world champion Milinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who played in this championship under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the bronze dispute, Kuzutina won Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament ended, she still admitted that the third place was not what she expected.
And again the obstacle on the way of the Russians to gold was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutina earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk bronze was placed in the mound of the Russian team by Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarter-final, his offender was former representative of Moldova, Viktor Skovortsov, who now plays for the UAE team.
However, the Russian then won two fights and became the winner of the award.
Mo<0xC5><0xBE>ushkov performed at the home championship with a skull injury, which he plans to cure in the near future, so he will take a break in the competitions.
As for ex-Moldovanin Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal in this tournament.
Interestingly, Ivan Remarenko, another fellow UAE national who accepted sports citizenship, finished a performance in the category of up to 100 kg with bronze.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which Ivan Nifontov won in the category up to 81 kg.
In the heavy battle of the small final, he defeated Frenchman Alan Schmitt by remarks from his opponent.
On Friday, three sets of prizes were played at once, but the Russians traditionally limited one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Vossov, and the Russian team was guaranteed this medal: his rival in the comforting final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the rival Question was unable to come out on the Tatas due to injury.
The men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was put in the squad by Renat Saidov, who played in the category over 100 kg.
In the comforting final, he won a clear victory over Brazilian David Moura.
This is how the individual part of the world championship ended.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions were played in team competitions.
Both Russian teams - both men and women - were one of the main contenders for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the beautiful sex were not lucky - they did not reach the medal.
But the Russian Judoists won the command silver.
In a decisive confrontation, in a persistent fight with a score of 2-3, they surrendered to the main favorites of the competition - the team of Japan.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after a clean victory of Han-Magomedov and left - Denis Yartsev (weighing up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories, their Japanese rivals were unable to cope with Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Cambyev (100).
In the same scenario developed and a bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, surrendered to the Japanese - 2-3.
The team competition in Chelyabinsk was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the end of the tournament congratulated the men's team with silver.
“The second place is very honourable, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could have become champions,” Putin said, according to RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the natives of the judo - there's nothing embarrassing here.
But I'm sure you can win with them.
The Russian national team at the home world championship played much better than a year ago at competitions of this level held in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian team had only three medals – one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstan and Mansur Isaev.
We are all, of course, great maximists.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let’s remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is among the eight strongest, then he is a potential Olympic winner.
Even more in this kind of sport, like judo," - summarized the results of the tournament the Russian Minister of Sports Vitaly Mutko, whose words are directed by the press service of the championship.
Japan's team is expected to become the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of different dignity, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.

The family of Joan Rivers hopes for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter has expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," Melissa Riverz said in a statement.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had had a heart attack at a Upper East Side clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "heavy".
The response was broad, including numerous online support from such people as Donald Trump, Mount Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Everybody can Kings.
The debut album of the band Royal Blood is a new hope of the British rock, bringing rock duets out of clubs directly to the stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo is on stage for the entire year, but has already been nominated for the BBC Music Award, a warm-up tour at the Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the make-up of the New York concert by Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before it was released, and the contract for its release lies in the portfolio of the major label Warner Music.
Given the current sad situation in the music market, the situation is coming from a number of outlets, because it is not the new Lane Del Ray or another sweet-haired representative of the "new R'n'B", but it was a duet of the duet of bulls in the eyes of the British, playing with the same level.
Overall, the bets on the first album due to all of the above-mentioned circumstances were particularly high and were already quite justified.
The duo did not take a name that they could have had before, except for the desperate hairy metallists, and the blood of which kings flows, as they think, in their veins, is also understandable.
It is, of course, primarily about Led Zeppelin's past-level characters: like the great quartet, Royal Blood set their goal to shake the blood of the British rock, bringing it to a new height.
To make predictions about the success of this enterprise so far, perhaps prematurely, but something can already be affirmed.
The dozens of songs in thirty minutes are not so much a demonstration of the phenomenal composer’s gift as a confident and powerful statement of intentions.
Some of the advantages of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: let’s say, the pilot single “Out Of The Black” is characterized by what is remembered not by the melodic line, but by the drum party.
The musicians in a joke say that this song is generally easier to punch than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the cover album "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy rock lovers' party, but when played consecutively they merge into a more or less uniform canvas.
It’s not necessarily bad, and vice versa.
The power of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (they soon become Motörhead's successors), but have removed numerous rock duets from the ghetto Indian clubs.
Their music, despite some variety created for stadiums, in a room of less than a couple of thousand people, is apparently close to it.
The secret is partly in the clever use of the bass, replacing the guitar in the usual format, invented at the beginning of The White Stripes.
However, it is not only about the instruments, but also about the very approach to the composition of songs.
The heroes of the zero retrorock were hard to choose outside of the postmodernist paradigm, with a huge reluctance to recognize themselves not just as epigones, but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sounds so powerful and abrupt that this effort successfully drapes some of the secondaryity and hardness of the musical material.
After all, who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon to buy Twitch for <0x24>1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: an online store — and a video producer, and a hundred other things — is buying Twitch’s streaming video playback service for <0x24>1.04 billion (<0x24>970 million).
This news turned out to be a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google video service for a good billion seemed completely ready, and this combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a streaming service of a general nature – a YouTube version in real time.
Instead, it quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; “YouTube for real-time games,” according to Business Insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which all-encompasses give (mainly old) play processing, as in "The Mystery Theatre", already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with no particular interest, a classic example of a rooted tech company buying out a potential competitor.
It’s a secret why the deal with YouTube failed, given that, according to available information, it was willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have at the moment is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmett Shire: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster.”
Another secret, to be honest, is Twitch’s incredible success.
Snobs like me, who claim to be better at sports than watching it, find it hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games rather than taking the joist into their own hands.
One thing is to look through a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. when she slips through Resident Evil, and the other is to watch a stranger get 20 shots in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games that you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today’s most popular games are designed for one person, so watching their shooting without controlling the angle of view alone can be a recipe for a headache worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speed passages in which the Rogers Bannisters of our e-age finish whole games in record time are entertaining.
But if it’s not about game virtuosis or humor, it’s unlikely that its Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
What do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and is the fourth-largest source of peak internet traffic.
How does Amazon earn on this?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch will turn to Amazon Instant Video just as elegantly as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would be happy to get: the crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As the head of Twitch Shir said, Amazon and Twitch "believe in the future of games," and this channel does not give signs of extinction, even - oh - as a spectacular sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed as a result of the 2004 terrorist attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We spoke with the survivors - almost all of them now students, with the parents of the deceased, with the supervisor of the cemetery - City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the committee "Mother Beslan" Susana Provyatya, Ansandna Dudieva, who took part in the special operations "Ebde, a staff member"
Already returning to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the president in the North Caucasus and held talks with the terrorists, as well as with the FSB’s Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What particularly shocked me during my work on this topic is that there was no such thing as a decade in Beslan.
This topic is extremely painful for anyone who has at least some relation to it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very difficult.
But you can’t forget Beslan, and I hope we managed our task,” Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the infographic studio of the holding Rambler & Co, which has been working in the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s stay in power.
North Korea launches short-range missiles
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Japanese Sea, Renhap reports.
The launch was made at around 10:30 a.m. local time from the province of Chagando, on the border of North Korea and China.
The missile allegedly crashed into the Japanese Sea after flying about 220 km, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee said.
MEPs have proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
In case of success of the initiative, the data of the Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from 1 January 2015.
The State Duma has submitted a draft law, which provides for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is placed on the basis of the legislative activities of the lower chamber.
Its authors were the deputies of the State Duma Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov (“United Russia”), Vladimir Parahin (“Just Russia”) and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a more efficient and efficient guarantee of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the security of personal data and the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, whose entry into force is urgent for parliamentarians, obliges to store in the territory of the Russian Federation the personal data of Russians processed over the Internet.
It also makes mandatory the recording, systematization, storage, storage, clarification and extraction of personal data of Russian citizens, in databases located in the territory of Russia, as well as the indication of the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right, on the basis of a court decision, to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of the so-called "black lists" of infringing websites - the automated information system "Register of infringers of the rights of subjects of personal data".
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrey Lugova and Vadim Dengin from LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from KPRF.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also one of the authors of the current draft law on the date of the entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in Russia will have to pay for rent
Commenting on the draft law submitted to the State Duma today, Leonid Levin, the first deputy chairman of the Duma Committee on Information Policy, said he saw no problems with the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own storages of personal data of Russians in the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "in Rostelekoma", which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent, Ma is ready for sale, and are ready for sale.
“In addition, there are several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this area,” he added.
“If companies decide to enforce the law and continue to operate in the territory of the Russian Federation, I don’t see any problems – they will get technological opportunities for hosting,” Levin said.
Controversial Bill
Immediately after the publication of the bill, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that in the event of the adoption of the bill, the Russians will no longer be able to use many global internet services.
In particular, it is about online booking services of airline tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the bill deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation the right to dispose of their own data imperatively stipulating that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation".
The statement of the RAEC stressed that a more effective measure would be the establishment of a mechanism to inform the user about where the recording is being carried out and the systematization of his personal data.
In this case, he will be able to choose in which territory the actions will be carried out.
The adoption of such bills on the “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the abandonment of global services and significant economic losses.
Participant of the test with an ice water barrel pulled out of the jaw
Isabelle Roberts from the UK was so yelling when ice water was poured on her head that damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test with a jar of ice water didn't go to the pain.

The militias handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The "Army of Novorossiy" claims to have shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuses the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
At 10:00 on 1 September, the militias handed over to the Ukrainian side 402 prisoners, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by the representative of the press service of the Army of Novorossia.
He added that "by the air defense forces in the area of the town of Mereshka will shoot down the Su-27 aircraft that violated the ceasefire agreement."
According to a spokesman for the agency, the Ukrainian side in the artillery shooting of the Lugano airport used the prohibited international conventions of cassette ammunition.
A spokesman for the press service noted that the militias overnight managed to damage two Ukrainian Air Force helicopters at one of the field airports, as well as destroy two armored carriers and two warehouses with ammunition.
"The losses in the enemy's life force - up to one hundred people killed and wounded, 13 people surrendered into captivity," - a representative of the staff summarized.
“Interfax” has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the "people's republics" of the Donbass announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side in compliance with the ceasefire regime of 223 detainees and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, the army of the DPR, according to the "Army of Novorossia", "intercepted the attempt of the National Guards in violation of previously reached agreements to remove heavy equipment from the area."
Then the militias reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) for that night consisted of five tanks, eight armored vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian military personnel was surrounded by militias in the Ilovaisk area in the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leadership of “people’s republics” to release Ukrainian military personnel from the area.
The DPR agreed to do so on the condition that the enemy surrenders weapons and ammunition.
The first dozen soldiers began to leave the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semen Semenchenko, another 14 people left the "cattle" on the night of Sunday.
In his Facebook page, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity at 137 regiments of the 32nd division of the Russian Federation and 9 tank brigades of the Russian Federation", where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence of Russia have denied the communications of the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures in the event of new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation reports.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the “conclusions” of the European Council of August 30 demonstrated the inability of EU member states to overcome the inertia of their clear support from the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, based on “absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of the country,” the ministry’s website said.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that Eurosovet, contrary to the interests of its member states, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening its confrontation with Russia.
Members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full “dialogue between the opposing parties”, the ministry stresses.
The Ministry’s website also notes that there are currently no objective estimates of the humanitarian situation in the Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has deployed, and the number of casualties among the civilian population is increasing.
We would like to remind you that in the coming week in the European Union is planned to develop concrete proposals on sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives work closely with U.S. officials.
It is expected that they will correlate the measures imposed with each other by the period of action and the degree of stiffness.
The new EU sanctions could affect the energy and financial sector.
The Australian government has also announced the extension of sanctions against Russia in the defence, finance and oil and gas industries.
Hitrite ways to save on university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds <0x24>1,000 a year, Matt Schröder, who is about to move on to the second course, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of leasing books to seniors, offering them a nominal compensation so that they could postpone their sale.
"My mathematical analysis tutorial, which usually costs <0x24>180, I got a semester for <0x24>10 and a Chick-fil-A cookie," says Schröder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for last semester would cost <0x24>430, he says.
He spent <0x24>120.
According to the Colleges Council, an average student spends more than <0x24>1,200 a year on textbooks and tutorials, but students have a number of options to reduce these expenses.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas similar to the Schröder system.
Book rental is becoming more and more popular, allowing students to enjoy the book during the semester, and is often considerably cheaper than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university book stores, reports that the volume of book rentals has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were rented during the last spring semester, says Nibo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the professional association "National Association of University Stores".
Here’s an introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Purchase in the online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price for a new book can be one-third of what you’ll see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs about <0x24>290 per price tag, but a new copy can be purchased for <0x24>239.99 at Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of used
If you’re not against other people’s marks or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for <0x24>93.49 in a used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Casey, a 25-year-old fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid on Amazon.com 42 cents for a second-hand textbook called Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding the Business side of Advertising Business.
The book was sold for <0x24>48.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Bracey, the director of the College without Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, invites students to clarify with their professors whether previous publications can be used.
Sometimes updates are not important for classes.
In such cases, old publications can often be found for a very small fraction of the cost of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Renting
To rent textbooks, it is worth thinking, if you will be good enough to deal with them, do not forget to return them and do not want to leave them to yourself after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to hire a Mathematical Analysis for a semester for about <0x24>20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that may be imposed on you for tags, highlights, and damages.
If you rent a book, remember: if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually leased by acquiring an electronic license for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The rental of Mathematical Analysis on Chegg.com for six months will cost approximately <0x24>61.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the most favorable prices, as many classical works can now be downloaded for free, while literature on natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
Regardless of what, take a look.
Joe Gold, 29, who is about to start studying at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the price for the book, as it guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Before ordering online, Golt says, be sure to check if the book is actually in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was postponed for four weeks, and, in the end, he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin declares complete ineffectiveness of the Far East Development Fund
Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budgetary investment fund for development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
“15 billion rubles remain on deposits,” the president stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State ordered to accelerate the adoption of the list of territories for advanced development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of the TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the president noted, did not approve the list of territories for advanced development in the Far East until 1 July, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks to ensure the development of the Far East.
Among them, the increased accessibility of transport in the region, the lifting of infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create prerequisites for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form areas of forward-development that must become competitive with key business centers of ATR, the president stressed.
It was previously reported that the territory of the foreseeable development could replace the OECD.
Why ‘Galaxy Guards’ Couldn’t Save Cash Flows
Silvestra Stallone has returned less than <0x24>30 million from his <0x24>90 million budget in the United States, while "The City of Sins: The Woman That Is Worth Killing for" has only returned <0x24>12 million from his <0x24>70 million budget.
"Home video" with Cameron Diaz brought just <0x24>14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's movies such as "How to Instruct a Dragon 2" also disappoint revenue.
The article by Telegraph critic Robbie Collin points out that when it comes to children’s films, it may be in poor quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year in history when it comes to children's movies, and called "How to Train Dragon 2" a barely "functioning" sequel to fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem does not necessarily consist of the movies themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film released in rent in the summer in the amount of at least 2,000 copies between May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both film viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s crop is similar to the caliber of last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that the issue may be in changing viewers’ habits and the growing popularity of streaming internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favoro, who is currently working on the soon-to-be-hired Disney film "The Jungle Book," told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing."
We must acknowledge this and not try to pursue what was before.
Unlike the current drop in Hollywood cash fees, Netflix’s revenue from the streaming service reached <0x24>1.2 billion, almost double the <0x24>837 million last year.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comics franchises, and predicted Hollywood’s “cracks.”
In light of the current downturn, some commentators claim that his dark predictions were a part of the truth.
Due to the fact that several potential cash hits are expected in the summer of 2015, including "Avengers: The Age of Altron", "Minionov" and "Yursky Park", other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
Man X producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in cash fees simply “cyclical,” saying the Hollywood Reporter: “Next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and no one will worry about it.”
The food sanctions do not scare the owners of Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And in general, the whole food so far prefers to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“It’s better to have a little salty cucumber than a bad mozzarella,” says the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio about the quality of cheeses offered by the suppliers in exchange for the Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they had a small shelf life.
The stock of parmesan should be enough for a couple more months.
What can I do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005 I was at the Dorohomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it’s clear: shocking memories don’t let him go yet.
The meat was on the trucks only 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we would never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's all changed now.
But in the days I was brought to try fish from the Far East.
So she turned out to be brick!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many things are common for Italy for a Russian manufacturer in the wild.
A few years ago I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, the meat is suspended in the refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It needs to hang in order to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, “Where did you get this sweet meat?”
I said, it's yours, Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" on the kitchen hangs a stop-list, which lists the missing products: French oysters, seafood.
The chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" and the bar "Strelka" Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: the oysters from France have already replaced the oysters from Tunisia, and instead of the French cheeses the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, Regis also becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Colored cabbage - 200 rubles!
I'm asking, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
They say, “We have to make money, too.”
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far Eastern oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, do you know how much their armor weighs?
It turns out to be super delicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of scare for foreign cooks.
Standard story: “The first three months were good, then the quality fell sharply.”
The main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibration and quality.
Many restaurants in European cuisine don’t know what will happen to them when the cheese stocks run out.

Sanctions Menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of separate economic measures to ensure Russia’s security, which are called mainly product sanctions.
It is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and by-products from domestic poultry, meat delicacies, fish, mollusks, milk, yogurts, cream, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have started a deal with suppliers: prices for products have risen, you need to urgently look for analogues from other countries.
Most of all, this will affect the costly restaurants with the mono-kitchens of France, Italy, Spain, to which the products were delivered directly from "mother" countries.
The survey had to be redesigned earlier.
For example, when in early 2014 the Rosselhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, the suppliers set up supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions in the summer of 2014 turned out to be much more serious.
True, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban on Atlantic salmon and fur, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, nuts and onions.
Italy’s Valerio hopes that the sanctions can still be mitigated.
Some of the restaurants still exist in uncertain circumstances.
According to the East-West company, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
“Dear restaurants will have to change the menu under what local farmers and other countries produce,” says Sergei Mironov, a restaurant owner of the agency “Restconsult”.
If the chef is strong, it won’t be a problem for him.
We have very few such chefs, and the development of a new menu can take two or three months.
Trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" is ready for this: you will have to refuse 10-15% of the dishes, another half of the menu - to be recycled.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens already start to replace dishes, for example, steaks from marble beef - for beef strogans, says Sergey Mironov.
“The raw materials from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian raw materials, raw materials from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile,” said Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of the East-West company.
Creams and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
U.S. chicken can be replaced with chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and sesame from Norway - salmon, sesame, forelle from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, the budget network restaurants will be easier to restructure than the premium segment: it is unlikely there were gourmets able to distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian.
Although it will be difficult for the Ginza Project institutions, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
There will be a lot of time to replace,” says Mironov.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the lack of owners in the country.
Owners of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisines emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than Europeans.
But there are also many restaurants that are barely affected by sanctions.
These include institutions with the cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
“There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine,” says Hatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe “Way Mae!”.
All cheeses are made for us in Russia, the basis of many dishes is chicken fillet, we do not use exotic greens."
At the Kolbai establishments have not yet removed any dishes from the menu.
Timur Lansky, the owner of the restaurant "Chaihon N1" with Uzbek cuisine, the sanctions do not bother either: he will only have to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia sets up imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe.
From the CIS you can get cheaper cuts, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what they import from Central Asia is much better than “plastic” from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About Uzbek tomatoes everyone knows that they are delicious, sweet.
No one talks like that about Spanish.
After the sanctions imposed, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Uzbekistan, Olimbay Artykov, said that he plans to increase exports of fruit and vegetable products to Russia twice by 2016.
Their intention to replace European imports into Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions was stated by Belarus and Kazakhstan.
Fastfood restaurants, which responded to the "Deneg" request, also respond fairly calmly to the sanctions.
McDonald’s said the localization is more than 85% and the network is working with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the department working with suppliers Subway Russia, about 80% of the products the network buys in Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that produce imported raw materials.
In Teremka, "sanctionary products" generally occupied no more than 4%.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the Walker nuts.
KFC, Burger King and Little Potatoes did not respond to a request for money, but other market participants claim that the degree of localization of Burger King is significantly lower than that of McDonald’s.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are ready to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far East fish.
On his hillside
In the meantime, restaurants complain that as the demand increases, prices are rising even for local products.
"On products for "Brabile" prices have increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant "Cherry Mio" - twice," says restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of dishes will increase by 5-10%, Kolbaya admits.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have traveled by 10-15% since the beginning of August."
“Brazilian suppliers have increased prices for pork almost twice,” said Sergei Cank, deputy CEO of Stardogs.
Chickens travelled by 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will plan to increase prices by 8%.
It’s also very unwanted to raise prices,” says Cancer.
According to statistics, overall income growth for the second quarter of 2014 was only 1.8%.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it’s unclear how fast: while most restaurants have stocked food for the next two months in hopes of surpassing purchase prices.
But what will happen in two months, no one knows.
On the square in front of the Moscow Mayor stands a dozen tents, decorated with greenery and wood.
At the center of the scene, the musicians play waltz.
It is a festival of regional products with the fun title "There is time to eat".
“We were going to make a holiday of local food for a long time, and here it is the sanctions, we have swamped, organized the festival,” one of the organizers says.
Behind the scenes with the musicians, the Greek chef Anastas prepares a salad made of macaroni and homemade candy, during the day there was a master class of cooking a bourbon with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents - an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, olenena from Salehard, vegetables from the Moscow suburb "Sovhoz of Lenin", cheese from the crushing Italian Jay Clous.
"The salmon for restaurants can be safely replaced with another salmon species from the Far East," said Philip Galkin, owner of the fish store "His People".
We're hunted for fox, ketchup, walnuts, shrimp, cauliflower - "King's salmon".
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon, because it's a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take him in your hand, he won't even move.
And you will not hold our far-eastern salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian mozzarella with the domestic mozarella
In the window of his tent are shrimps with the tag "Magadan", feathers, omul, muksun, media from the Crimea, shrimp from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it is time to move to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant portion of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 - about 800,000 tons.
Lavka "My People" has been working since 2012, selling fish through an online store, before the sanctions were imposed served another and a half dozen restaurants, such as "Simple Things".
So far, 15 other restaurants have applied to Galkin.
The same droughts can be made from our fish, it will heat up.
We froze, tried different recipes.
Now we sell land through an online store for a million rubles per month.
Our fish is cheaper several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
To confirm the Galkin's tent, I'm getting a portion of Philadelphia with a keto.
Unlike rollers with seven, these have to be chewed longer, but the awareness that this fish is ours, the domestic, gives strength.
On the website of the store "My People" there are even rolls of coat and sea turtle.
In sushi bars, it is preferable to replace Norwegian salmon with Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains this by the fact that lean cooks invent new recipes with far-eastern fish.
"Russian fish suppliers have not offered us yet," - gives his explanation owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseyev.
Approximately the same situation with other products: Russian producers could have occupied the liberated niche, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project Boris Akimova, it is now possible to talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations, which have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace banned imports unlike our farmers.
That is to say, large producers of other countries will benefit primarily from the ban,” Akimov said.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry has also received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
As a result of the mass over-the-counter inspections of Rospotrebnadzor, three McDonald’s companies in Moscow and two regional companies in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the essence of the claims made to determine the actions needed to open restaurants to visitors as soon as possible," Money said in a statement to McDonald's.
Actually, no one knows what's going to happen next.
If everything is limited by food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, - says the company's employee in restaurant consulting on condition of anonymity.
If McDonald’s is closed all over the country, the script will be completely different.
"European Protocol" instead of references to GIBDD
Payments for the helmet can be received without a GIBDD certificate - so the CB intends to stimulate the implementation of the "European Protocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft of instructions, according to which from 1 September of this year to receive cashback payments an insured driver will be able to manage without a GIBDD certificate.
Indeed, it is only in cases where the accident was carried out under the “European Protocol” without the participation of the road police.
That is, if only two cars participated in the accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit and both drivers have reached an agreement on who was responsible for the accident.
From 2 August, the payment limit under the "European Protocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400,000 rubles.
The point is that often even with minor damages, in a situation where a car can be ordered under the "European Protocol", drivers who have been in an accident, are invoked by the DPS.
After all, in the presence of a helmet policy, it was not possible to get a refund without a GIBDD certificate.
The parameters prescribed in the draft guidelines are precisely designed to remove this obstacle in the way of the implementation of the "European Protocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment per helmet in connection with the TDAH made without the staff of the GIFF should not be less than the limit under the "European Protocol".
However, it cannot be higher than the limit specified in the casco insurance contract.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically able to unload both the employees of the DPS and the roads.
But it is likely that neither drivers nor insurers will be impressed by it.
The latter are already talking about the serious threat of the growth of fraud, which can lead to the introduction of new rules for cash payments.
As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait hours for the inspector to arrange a small accident because it is so reliable.
And it is still unknown what will be easier - to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of the "European Protocol".
The savings certificate will make it nameless and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates on the applicant, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of irrevocable deposits.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban savings certificates on the applicant.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as the rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that savings certificates on the applicant do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, as there is no need to make deductions to the Fund of the Deposit Insurance Agency (ASV).
The picnic of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken due to small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and it will be affected by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to the ASV, control 98% of the profile market.
And the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, explained in the ASV, is that customers of a small bank who bought such a certificate, in case of revocation of his license, are trying to get money at the ASV.
Some investors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates for an applicant, may assume that their investments are insured.
Reasonable lack of insurance payments under these certificates in the event of the withdrawal of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In practice, the agency had cases where the holders of the applicant certificates tried to seek insurance compensation through the court," - said in the ASV.
The problem, of course, is invented.
After all, there will be no one to pay the buyers of certificates after all, because they have no right to reimbursement from the state by law.
If the instrument had not been insured in the ASV, it would have also banned metal accounts, on which citizens' funds are counted in the grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts are also not included in the deposit insurance system, but no one is trying to exist them yet.
The thing is most likely that certificates on the applicant are a very convenient securities, which can actually act as quasi-denominated.
At the same time, their movement is virtually impossible to control: any client of the bank can buy a certificate, pass it on to any citizen, and before billing such a certificate can change many owners.
It is not by chance that the bill states that the savings certificate must necessarily be a nominal securities, which must be stored in the depository.
And to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of early repayment.
That is, an analogy is introduced of the irrevocable deposit, which bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO summit: the first protests in Newport and Cardiff
Protests took place over the weekend by those who protested at the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclau monitored for us the developments over the weekend and spoke to the protesters who came from all over the world: from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will deliver weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31, referring to a decision taken following a meeting of representatives of the Federal Government headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to send 30 portable anti-tank missile complexes Milan and 500 cargoes to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Deliveries will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million to Iraq for humanitarian aid.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will speak in the Bundestag with a government statement on the subject.
So far, Germany has not put its weapons in “hot spots.”
The views of the German people on the dispatch of weapons to Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop ISIS fighters, while others fear that this weapon could eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militia raided Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militias have beaten a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, itar-TASS reported on August 31.
According to available data, this occurred in Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Anonymous (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported the shooting of two coastal guard ships.
It is clarified that the incident occurred today at about 16:20 msk.
Teenagers picked up by helicopter from Blue Mountains
TWO teenagers were taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night trapped in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man went on a trek shortly after noon on Sunday at Govetts Lip in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team, which included local police and rescue teams, was sent, and the couple was found around 11 p.m. near the waterfall of Bryadal Valley.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and shook his head.
Officers stayed with the couple for the night, and they were picked up on a swamp on Monday morning.
They were taken in a stable ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
The two unions met
The negotiations at the summit in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were called, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian
Although worrying (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delays), EU and Customs Union leaders discussed a number of "hot problems" for the first time.
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is unclear; but it is clear who removed the creams from this summit.
Questions on this account came to light on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, followed by other Eurasians and Europeans, saw the new President Lukashenko in the television news.
The Belarusian leader was an example of refined courtesy, it was the behavior of a person who had just spoiled the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in a higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of three major European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf - not just the legitimization of the president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies Denis Melyantsov is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk in the same tone as before.
“The fact that Katherine Ashton has met with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to freeze,” he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the Belarusian authorities began preparations for the breakthrough long before the November Maidan in Kiev – in the summer of 2013.
"The results have been achieved and with the EU - these are successful negotiations to simplify the visa regime and readmission, dialogues on modernization - and negotiations on international security have been held with the United States.
The U.S. has even lifted a few sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them have only eased the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose a lot in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de-jure not recognized the accession of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militias in the Donbass with all the rigor, did not argue with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave either the Customs Union or the OECD, and the Russian air base is located in Baranovich.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue – and assessed it, Belarusian experts are sure.
How successful Lukashenko’s move towards political diversification will be, will be seen by how often in the near future Minsk will have to hold meetings in the EU<0x2B>TS format.
In the press service of EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy Catherine Ashton was unable to answer promptly questions about what Brussels expects from relations in the new format.
Press secretary Ashton Maya Kosyanchich just said "Ogonku" that, against the backdrop of the resolution of the issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.
At the same time, it was reported that the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of first persons in the new format could also be Kazakhstan.
The cape of the deg for Minsk became a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he, it turns out, was personally asked by representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: not all parties are against Minsk being the central meeting place for both Russia--OSCE--Ukraine, as well as at the level of Heads of State and High Representatives of the European Commission.
This means that “the last dictator of Europe” will gain the status of a very handsome European leader who helps to solve the global problem.

The EU delegation itself, including the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, has already pushed to the conclusion: the main drawback of the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the schedule of future gas supply negotiations and the overcoming of the concerns of the CIS countries on the Ukraine’s association agreement with the EU appears to be a greater achievement than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Karl de Gücht, however, noted: EU representatives “come to Minsk to look for a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences rather than the other way around.”
It seems, however, that the economic crisis in Ukraine also “works” in Belarus.
Its consequences – and in particular the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia – give Minsk, which is currently under the sanctioning pressure itself, the long-awaited field for the maneuver.
According to the head of the Mises Research Centre, former candidate for Belarusian president Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus’ opportunities to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation in order to circumvent sanctions.
At the same time, the schemes of supplies are being developed, for which Vladimir Putin rushed Minsk at the summit.
"The initiators of these schemes," Romanchuk stressed, "are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long been developing schemes for delivery of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
The Russian business needs to recover them in some way, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second plot, the expert continues, is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not far from setting up production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about <0x24>4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes can now be very in demand.
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the venue for EU and TS negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of the development of economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow’s sanctions are estimated at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5-10 billion, and the European Commission has currently offered farmers only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>125 million in compensation.
The Belarusian president could propose to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for European farmers.
This could raise Lukashenko’s authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without an initiative
Katherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the TS<0x2B>EU format is diverging, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with his Ukrainian colleague stressed that the initiator of the new format was Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any effort to discuss, not from the bay-barakhta to make a decision, after the signing of the Treaty of Association with the EU, to understand the situation that was taking place in Ukraine at the time," he said before the cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic ministry carefully emphasize that Belarus in the organization of the cooperation of the EU and the TC on its land does not pursue utilitarian goals, but the ultimate goal of such a format - the creation in the future of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other spheres, particularly in the field of security, promote and promote the leadership of our strategic ally – the Russian Federation,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus said.
In Moscow, there may be areas with paid admission.
The Moscow government is considering the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of combating the overload of central roads by analogy with other major cities in the world, M24.ru reports with reference to Moscow Mayor Maxim Likistova on transport issues.
One of the options that has successfully proven itself is a paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, see all the downsides and advantages.
To talk about the fact that some decisions have been made in this regard until early," - said Liksutov.
The mayor stressed that for the authorities of the capital is very important the experience of Asian cities, which in structure and loading are similar to Moscow.
One of the decisions taken by these countries is the construction of the central ring road already underway, Lixsutov added.
The recently begun construction of the Central Ring Highway is an example of what does not necessarily pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there was sufficient access infrastructure, there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow,” the mayor said.
Maksim Liksutov also stated that the introduction of paid parking has significantly unloaded the capital streets.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at what has been achieved.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, took part in the ceremony of the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CKAD).
Skuka (disambiguation)
Frank Miller’s and Robert Rodriguez’s “City of Sins 2: The Woman for Whom It Is Worth Killing” made the wrong revolution that could be expected of him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), filmed with the minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between film, comics and literary nuar.
Sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental chain of thought "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if you understand by the thesis the universe of Noara, and by the antithesis - the cosmos of comics).
From now on it should be read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
"The City of Sins 2" is chaotic both on a dramatic and philosophical level: both are chaotic in the wrong sense of the word.
Yes, some of the characters are familiar with the first "City", although, here, murmured Marv (Mickey Rurk), remembers, died on an electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to boast - in the role of such a folk friend - from the air of the knife and the knife.
But the elderly are literally kicked out by the elbows of the newcomers, as if they broke into the city from some other film, about the meaning and the plot of which spectators are asked not to worry.
So, his story, shamelessly twisted by the authors in the most interesting place, is with the super-successful actor Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Hers is with voluntarily-frigid Eve Lord (Eva Greene) and for something to her vengeful Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, let's say, does not stand out from Johnny - especially since faces, like other parts of the body, are dealt with characters with inexorably regularity - is not a problem, not even a half-poverty.
It's not people, we understand that it's the archetypes of November: a rookie whore, too confident a player, who's satisfied in a "honey trap" sex detective, a corrupt senator.
Well, when the archetype dances with the archetype and the archetype chases, it's no longer a movie, but it's an abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is simply ridiculous.
In addition, even in this vast world there is something constant.
Fighting sluts from the first "City" are still holding round defense from the siege of their native forces of darkness.
Detective Hartigan's ghost doesn't exist, and he'll look at the fire, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem of "City of Sins 2" is another.
Frank Miller was good at the fact that as a cartoonist he talentedly connected comics and nuar, and as a director - he reversed the idea of how to transfer comics to the screen.
Comics and noar are two aggressively opposite "realities".
The phenomena of the comic in the modern form was born in the late 1920s, when the novels of Dashila Hammett "Blood Harvest" (1929), "Maltese Soccer" (1930) and "Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of the noor, which was called "hard-school" at the time.
Well, or pulp fiction.
The comics have given Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the seaman Popay - the eater of the spinach, giving him rich power, Superman, Batman, and the scissor Dick Tracy to Halk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "spider".
But there was something damaging in any comic film: the cartoon characters insistently did not want to grow up with the screen flesh, they remained predators in their surrounding will-nevolence of the "real" world.
To put it simply, they were purely deprived of "existence".
Noar, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the World Wars, the traditional novel – with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical backgrounds – lost all persuasion.
Which Forsites, which Tibo and Rugon-Makkaras, which even the Bolconian and Rostov think after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated in the format of a soap opera, and the criminal - i.e. marginal - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
On his skin, Hammett learned what it was like to work as a sanitary officer on the front.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, were at least close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Loosey, Edward Dmitryk.
Therefore, noar, the archetype of which they have asked, firstly, is rough and cynical, and secondly - strictly social.
This is almost an American version of socialism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable by the fact that it was unnatural, but organically connected the comic with the nuar.
For the first time on the screen, the comic was alive, not shy of its graphic nature, nor pretended to be a "real" film.
The darkness of the selling world, where the cardinal ordered murders, and the senator covered the monster-sadist's son, was quite worthy of Hammett's feather.
And picturesque details such as the cut heads, with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the genius James Ellroy, the author of the "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, the declaratively nauseous - representative of the neonaurus.
"The City of Sins 2" is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of the radical style of Miller-Rodriges to the tradition of comics.
This is probably due to the 3D technology.
When you look at the second "City of Sins", you feel trapped in a glass ball inside which snow falls asleep in a toy cloaca.
Most of the time, however, it is not snow, but bloody spots, but what’s the difference?
It’s about socialism and not saying anything.
After all, it is only possible when somewhere, somewhere we have sometimes, even on the edge of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can bring back a girl who has gone on the curved path or, say, tell her reluctant parents that her punisher is.
When there is no place in the city for sin except sin, sin is no longer sin, but the norm.
Annoying, like any other norm.
The chaos of "City of Sins 2" is just boring.
For the sake of justice, the domestic lease gave this fresh sin a small but peach.
The titles warn: the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
In relation to the spectacle, in the very vegetarian episode of which a man is broken with his fingers, this gives a hellish humor.
Hammett would have liked it.
France’s socialists must “stop and put France in order,” says key ally Fraseau Hollande
Mr. Valle called on the deeply divided left-wing forces to "demonstrate a warm attitude" towards the targeted socialist president, whose restructurings have not been endorsed by the overwhelming majority of French.
The President deserves the respect of everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, applauding.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the sparking conflict of the proposal, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new minister of the economy.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain “unified” with the government.
However, Justice Minister Christian Tobira put the sticks in the wheels, coming to a meeting of disagreeing members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost faith in the future.”
Marine Le Pe, the leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflicts among the socialists, saying she did not imagine that the new Wallace government would last for several months.
François Hollande is a bare king, but naked, and Prince Manuel Valle, forced to gather a new government when the summer was not lasting.
"And the new will not last either autumn or winter," Mrs. Le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for the dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and be ready to run.
The ruling party of France experienced a defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A Sunday’s Journal du Dimanche poll found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is at risk of falling apart into several rival factions by the end of Mr. Hollande’s 2017 presidential term.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Scientology, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment.
“He has little time, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that something is changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
"City Without Drugs" remains unrequited
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court has ignored the claim of the Regional Ministry of State Property Management to the “City Without Drugs” fund.
The agency intended to collect from the organization more than 7 million rubles as a fee for the lease of the building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the arbitration court of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the claim of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) to the fund "City without drugs" (one of the founders - Mayor of Yekaterinburg Eugeny Royzman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect from the organization 7.3 million rubles as a fee for the lease of the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff did not appear in court twice, which was why a decision was made to refuse the hearing.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the MUGISO directorate could not explain, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not respond to phone calls.
The Fund’s representatives were also unable to contact.
We are reminded of the mansion, which held the foundation in the center of the city on Belinsky Street, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
This decision was made by the former governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Oblast filed a lawsuit against the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court for the expulsion of the foundation from the building.
According to the claim, the Office required through the court to recognize the unconfirmed contract of free use as the residence of the memorial mansion.
According to the Directorate of the IUGISO, the agreement did not include significant conditions for the lease of the cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court rejected the claim, then an appeal was lodged at the 17th Arbitration Court of Perm, which was satisfied.
Subsequently, the fund filed a case against the decision, which remained unsatisfactory, after which the decision was appealed by the fund in the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court accepted the side of the board.
In 2013, a new lease was signed, under which the fund again began to pay the rent, said the mayor of the city Eugene Royzman.
The lease was allocated 300,000 rubles per month.
The previous administration of the region has given us this building for free use, recognizing our merit in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the foundation.
The current administration has decided otherwise,” he said.
Tatiana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the Mayor of Yekaterinburg was offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the pride of Yekaterinburg, the single-Russian Alexander Kosintsev, offered the mayor of the city - the spokesman of the pride of Eugene Royzman to resign.
A criminal case was filed against the suspected in the murder of the retired deputy Oleg Kinev, who is considered a partner of the mayor.
How Eugene Royzman was found guilty
On 1 July, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of "defamation" (art. 128.1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation) in the blog of Yekaterinburg Mayor Evgeny Royzman.
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Sverdlovsk region, to which the Director General of the Legal Center "Zahitta" Anna Filatova addressed with the relevant statement.
According to her, Mr. Royzman accused her in his blog posts of being involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that “this is another attempt to avenge the truth.”
iPhone turns into a wallet
On the eve of September 9, when Apple is due to present its new developments, there are new leaks in the press about what can be expected from the presentation.
Referring to U.S. media sources, the sixth-generation iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project by Apple and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and a dedicated Internet resource Re/code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple may, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, resulting in a mobile wallet feature available in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse to make any comments on this.
This feature allows you to make a payment at the store’s cashier using a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be made by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will for the first time be embedded with NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows you to make a contactless payment using a smartphone and the corresponding reader on the wallet.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC feature was first introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that joined the so-called NFC Forum – the association to promote the technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC function – Samsung Nexus S – was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced a Google Wallet system that allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay via a smartphone on Android.
However, U.S. experts stress that despite the large investments of high-tech companies in promoting NFC technology, U.S. retailers are still cautious about innovating systems and are not too willing to spend money on their equipment.
Therefore, now observers hope that Apple’s entry into the market will still force retailers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their trading points.
France's Foreign Ministry: Paris' position on supplies to Russia "Mistrale" does not change
French Foreign Minister Romen Nadal said the position of Paris remains unchanged regarding the supply of Mistral-type helicopters to Russia.
“I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Hollande) in an interview with Le Monde on August 20: ‘Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is a decision of the Europeans, not of France,” Nadal quoted RIA Novosti as saying.
Thus, a representative of the French Foreign Ministry responded to the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will affect the change of Paris’ position on the implementation of this contract.

Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists Break the Statement of a Chinese Representative on the Day After Election Decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, swinging the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the All-China People’s Assembly on Sunday set a procedure by which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the 2017 Hong Kong presidential election.
All candidates should first receive the support of the majority of the members of the promotion committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get into the ballot paper and has forced the activists of the democratic movement to again promise to stop Hong Kong’s financial centre by protesting “Occupy Central”.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that a call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of a document describing China's control over Hong Kong in June, activists of the democratic movement held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city's business centre and built a seating area.
The briefing is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Relations Bureau in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Permanent Committee of the All-China People's Assembly, Zhang Rongshuang, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau State Council, Feng Wei, were also expected to speak at a series of briefings during the day.
Student activists said they would gather at the Hong Kong government chief’s building in the afternoon.
The United Kingdom did not mention Hong Kong's democratic rule until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to join 400 hectares of land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to join 400 hectares of land on the western bank of the Jordan River belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to the BBC, the decision to join the land of South Bethlehem is linked to the desire to pay for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Ministry of Defence said on Sunday it had ordered the military to set up an administrative administration on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saiba Arica, the global public should call on Israel to respond for “continued settlement activity on the west coast of Jordan and in East Jerusalem.”
Putin calls on Kiev to start negotiations on the "state" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “state” of the region.
His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean to suggest that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needs to be revised to give its Russian-speaking interests and possible protection to the region.
However, Putin’s call for the Kiev government to begin negotiations with pro-Russian rebels as equals corresponded to the obvious strategy he has followed since the bloodshed began five months ago: to help the Separatists take the territory, to force the Ukrainians.
In an interview with the state First Television Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to restore the separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Poluostov region.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently called the territories seized by Novorossia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians start campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26 and while government troops are attacking the peaceful settlements of the detained separatists.
“We must immediately start contentious negotiations not only on technical issues, but also on the political arrangement of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s words about statehood were meant in the context of a broader autonomy, which has been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
It is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The Kremlin’s intervention to correct the “false interpretation” of Putin’s words underscored the decision of the Russian leadership to conduct itself in relation to the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open capture of the Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic.
Moscow would have to endure a much more difficult battle to join even Donetsk and the Lugansk region of eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russian, and polls before the beginning of the conflict showed broad support for the desire to stay in.
The autonomy discussed by Russian diplomats at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, transferring to the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would connect the main territory of Russia.
The Black Sea Peninsula, joined five months ago, is home to the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and the Crimea are also mines, factories and casting plants, which produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his inaugural speech on June 7 that the Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, weigh the amendments to the constitution, allowing the separated regions to have greater control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose weapons and incitement are accused by Moscow.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to agree with the leaders of the separatists, as equals, followed the new rebel attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from the former peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
The separatists backed by Russia took control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive, which Ukrainian security officials say is fearful that it is the start of a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to Crimea itself.
This led to large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel harbor with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Novoazovsky and the narrow passageway to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
“We are approaching the point of no return,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for the drafting of more stringent sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 soldiers last week entered the Donetsk region to support the difficulties of the separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a co-secretary of the Soviet Union and a co-secretary of security.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who are reportedly detained in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lisenko said on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gaby Greco
Jeffrey Edelstein has expressed his hatred for hackers who may have stolen naked photos of his bride, Gaby Greco, and a list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of unveiled photos depicting naked Jennifer Lawrence came to the Internet as a result of a large-scale hacking scandal with celebrities.
The hacker responsible for it is said to have about 60 unveiled photos of the star of "Famine Games" Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Apton and Kara Delevin, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kiss.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Ivonn Insurance and living in Melbourne Greco have also been allegedly stolen photos as a result of a leak from iCloud.
In the list of 101 names of celebrities.
Edelstein, who made a proposal to Greece last month, said Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It’s awful that personal information can be stolen and shared with other people.
Greece, which is based in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacking attack was “shameful” and that those to whom it was directed “feel they were invaded.”
The hacker is thought to have 30 photos of Palmer with former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two frames where she lies by the pool with her naked chest.
Palmer's works in the film include "Love and Honor" along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the film "Chack" and the actress from "Forbidden Reception" Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen photos.
A spokesman for Lawrence told TMZ, "It's a naked invasion of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his outrage at the hacker, writing on Twitter: “Photographing stolen from a mobile phone is actually nothing different than selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, you cannot tolerate the publication of stolen photographs.
Possible way to steal photos of naked celebrities
Massive star account hacking may be caused by a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential scenario of development was described by The Next Web resource.
On the Github resource was published a script in Python, which allowed you to select passwords for Apple’s Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of your iPhone.
To access it, the same login link and Apple ID password is used as to access the Apple iCloud cloud from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed the reset method to recognize the password from Find My Phone.
This method introduces all sorts of combinations of characters, starting with the most frequently used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the number of password options entered in Find My Phone is unlimited.
With the correct organization of the security system after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password the account should be blocked and notify the user of the attempted hacking.
Due to the vulnerability, users have not received any notifications of an attempt to retrieve a password to their account.

Anger was the most universal and functional emotion of man.
An angry expression of a face is biologically universal to humanity, and every person involved in its organ and muscle group is not random, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers from Australia and the United States found.
They spoke about their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and can be read briefly in a press release from the University of California in Santa Barbara.
Angry expression of the face - moved and dropped down the eyebrows, stretched into the thin line of the lips, swollen nostrils - the same in all cultures, and make it even blind from the birth of children, never seen it, notes the lead author of the study.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, the scientists discovered that this emotion originated to effectively manage disputes during a conflict.
The more physical harm one person can inflict on another, the more opportunity he has to dictate his conditions, and he brings it to the interlocutor by means of anger.
The researchers found evidence and their other hypothesis: physically strong people are more often angry and turn to appliances, consider themselves to have the right to impose unfavorable conditions on others, and also prefer force-based methods of resolving conflicts to peaceful ones.
Turning away from the fact that anger is above all a "trade emotion", the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create an angry expression of the face should represent the angry individual's more powerful and dangerous condition in the eyes of the interviewee - and so on.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers modeled a person on a computer where each of the seven elements of an angry person was present or absent, and showed them to informants.
While the lowered eyebrows or the forward eyebrows individually did not make the face evil, the person depicted with such traits more physically strong participants admitted unanimously.
Human anger, as in animals, poses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one’s own power, forcing one’s consent and submission.
A man inflates his nostrils and squeezes his lips with the same purpose as a fox that inflates, or a baboon that shows his claws.
Anger "starts" by the interlocutor's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form, most effectively demonstrating the opposite side of the consequences of this refusal.
But the most surprising thing is that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” said John Tubby, an anthropologist.
