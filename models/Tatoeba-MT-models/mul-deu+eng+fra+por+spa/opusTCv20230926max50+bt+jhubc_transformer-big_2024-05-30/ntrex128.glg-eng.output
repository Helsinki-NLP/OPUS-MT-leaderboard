Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned "that they take them for monikers"
Consternation among some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM in English, by the suggestion that they should change the name of the pole of MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate arose because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from all over the world are afraid to be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was worried that the new name would be "rima with Twp and with Pwp".
For those who do not know Welsh, "twp" means "parvo" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the group's group was "unhappy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the name change, but noted that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal jump.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similar to the English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals that showed strong support for the designation of the Parliament of Wales.
Regarding the issue of the title of AM, the commission preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received a majority of support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the fight to reach consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, from which the bill on the changes is expected to be handed over in a few weeks.
The Reforms Act will include other changes in the functioning of the Assembly, such as the rules for disabling AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on how they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim of its territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change in the plebiscite, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's camps keep silence as the churches of Harlem continue to fight
“The elders with whom I spoke said that before there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, neither one thing nor the other.”
He said he could understand that the bars would disappear.
"Now people are socializing in other ways," he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to.”
As far as churches are concerned, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, and “before or after that they will return to where they began.”
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities full of owners of the kind of people who would not help the neighborhoods continue to be shrines.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white, and thus will accelerate the closure of all these churches, because new owners are unlikely to become members of those churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation changed in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation was built with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street stores, a commercial Harlem street that resisted hiring and ascending black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as Father Johnson's frigates made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carpet.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly named the carillon "the camps of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it in another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that it was the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who changed it to the largest carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one occupies his place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin in recent months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the church's lay leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the organ that governs the parish and which is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing her concern that the latter "pretends to impact the costs" of the assembly, although the latter did not participate in the hiring of the architects and contractors that he sent to it.
Some frigates complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark hurts a boy while fishing for salmon in California
Police said a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while fishing underwater in California on the first day of the season of the crustacean.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he spent about half an hour diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, a moment when he was swimming with a group of people to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said at first that he thought it was just an emotion to fish a squirrel, but that he soon realized that I was whispering "I was worked!
They worked for me!"
He had his clavicular snagged." Hammel said he noticed when the boy arrived.
“Tell everyone who comes out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that they would split a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they would determine that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to the top of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty corridors similar to those of large warehouses full of specialist helpers.
As part of the considerable immersion in the UK beauty market, which amounts to <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashion sales and home products drop, the largest runners with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and then pass to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty occurs at a time when supermarkets seek to fill the shelves that in their day occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty product offering to reach 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with exclusive areas similar to those that can be seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range to make most of the products fit for vegans, something increasingly demanded by the younger customers.
The perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will also try concessions at two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small shops implies that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the establishments will increasingly resemble shopping malls as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat retail outlets in hundreds of stores, since it bought the two chains two years ago. By the way, this has strengthened sales of foodstuffs and cost-effective acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute the pharmacy's revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It was commented that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff who can go to what to ask for advice.
Our product range is designed to fit all needs and attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits.”
Peter Jones 'Angry' After Holly Willoughby Retired from <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Business
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has gone “furious” after television presenter Holly Willoughby retired from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for his brand of homewear and accessories Truly.
His company was compared to Goop, a brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones sparkling as she retired from her last-minute lifestyle brand to focus on her new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was "fury" when the television's gold girl admitted during a tense meeting held Saturday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant she no longer had time to dedicate her home to both clothing and clothing brand.
The business came to be compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby turned to Instagram to announce that he was leaving True, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed to one of his holiday residences.
A source said: “Truly was differently one of Holly’s priorities.
It would be your long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left atonement for all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow’s offices ready to sell.”
Experts believe that abandoning the presenter of This Morning is among Britain's most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, due to considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes and textiles to the home, and that could delay even more its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter on ITV's I'm Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night that “we should not comment on his business matters.”
A complicated conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "a little of a president's own" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he was putting his voice as a “television presenter.”
"I don't give up anything."
He said Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump considers a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
But the negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three weeks after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see the "corresponding response" by the U.S. to the first steps of North Korea's strike.
On the contrary, he stressed, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump has adopted a much more optimistic view in his mitin speech.
"Things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have this excellent relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: to end missile tests, to help free the hostages, and to bring the remaining U.S. troops home.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheatre, we'd have about 200 people out here," Trump said.
An earthquake and tsunami devastate an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they will not seek international aid, so it is a challenge," Sumung said.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute with their help.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly suffering, the country is extremely poorly prepared to face the anger of nature.
Although tsunamis shelters were built in Aceh, it is not common to find them on other sides.
Although an alert is issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the death toll.
In the best of cases, travelling between many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was deployed in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the new disaster to take place.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign has turned around the improvement of Indonesia's deteriorated infrastructure, and has spent money on roads and railroads.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a large lack of funds in the final straight to next year's re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a way of living the more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes because of clashes on the streets of Christian and Muslim gangs, who use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores the goal of the squad against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still 27 metres from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball with his left leg before throwing a shot at the second paw.
The balloon flew over the area as it advanced toward the top left corner of the net.
The ball ended up falling on a Kepa Arrizabalaga jumping in the air and entering the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to get us organized, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I come to Kante and say a touch without thinking too much and I just disappeared.”
Chelsea won 1-0 in the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning near the middle of the shift and entering the Liverpool field running.
Kovacic built a wall in the center of the field.
He made a beautiful deep pass leading to Hazard towards the area.
Hazard overtook the defense and ended up in the second leg marking a shot with the side that Alisson Becker was not able to stop.
Liverpool faced Naples in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, according to the national disaster management agency.
Many people would be trapped between the debris of the buildings that came down with the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday that caused waves of up to 6 meters, Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho said in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from demolished buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Woman Killed
A murder investigation was opened after a woman’s body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with white gunshot wounds on John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police asked the people of the area to see or hear something from that step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to make a call for anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera of the commanding officer who is contacting us, as they could have key information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body was found belonging to a neighbor in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who were beginning to meet the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was meeting that morning.
The investigation continues as police say they are in the process of informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have informed him that they do not allow anyone to enter or exit the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that they will not be able to re-enter within a few hours.
He heard a police officer tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There was a woman in the scene crying.
Don't stop saying "it's horrible."
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain within the cordon monitoring the block of apartments.
To anyone who has information, ask to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 citing Registration 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell's statue of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to "rewrite history"
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his fanatic and puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "stupid" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure, located outside the Westminster Palace, would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
They might have sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the 19th-century opinion, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider still worthy of homage.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century, than now, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in this case, of course, was the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a complete representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the mid-17th century conflict defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a side of division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
A killer pig cheats a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man, identified only by the nickname, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered with blood near a cutter in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig breeder prepares to put the vaccines to pigs in a slaughterhouse on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his grandfather found him dead and discovered an open door leading to another adjacent cutter.
He said there was a big man with blood in his mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, nearly 250 kilograms, attacked the farmer until killing him.
"My grandfather had his legs bleeding and stained," his cousin, who was nicknamed "Wu", told Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed her pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his grandfather.
A market director told Evening News that the pig had been shut down to prevent him from attacking anyone else while the police were gathering evidence on stage.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are not very common, cases of pigs that have previously attacked humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-kilogram-pound pig stabbed a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and shocked the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs do not tend to be aggressive, but that the taste of the blood can act as a "trigger."
"They're just playing.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they don't intend to do any harm.
You just have to have the respect you need,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy, widespread rain to the southwest of the United States.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it overtakes the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, East time, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a valley begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward toward the East Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Peninsula of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity northwards, which will penetrate the U.S. from its east.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction of tropical humidity with the valley will create abundant and widespread rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and the possibility of land clearance in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will be close to 50 or 75 l/m2 in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain is expected, especially on much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed character of the tropical rain.
We strongly discourage adventure in the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form cannons that could turn into floating rivers, and electric storms will bring locally raging winds and dust.
The valley will bring locally strong rainfall to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause flow of smaller debris and roads.
These would be the first rains of the wet season in the region.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rains extend at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature fluctuations in the U.S. due to the Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
Occasionally this implies significant temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the U.S.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm beginning of October is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high odds of temperatures above average for the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the trial of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate testimony of the Supreme Court-appointed judge Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and chains interrupt their usual schedule for a new last-minute Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh made toys while he was drunk and that he tried to get his clothes off at a college party.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that this would not happen.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company told the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that relayed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching TV from offices.
To make an idea, it's an audience similar to a football final or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all chains with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day trial, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with <0x24>3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement stating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning by protesters as he tried to enter a roadside elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He remained with a low look for several minutes as he was reprised, broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have power while there are many helpless women."
Flake said his office made a Flake statement, adding that before the elevator was shut down, he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable channels retransmitted live hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment before the full Senate to submit to the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee next week, which prompted a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and of damaging national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with his newspaper cover, his former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking May’s so-called Brexit Chequers plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs from the other side was “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Murdered: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police arrested a suspect in the shootings that ended the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU (Louisiana State University).
According to Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder charge.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to be the perpetrator of the shooting that killed Wayde.
The defendant said he was fined <0x24>350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Forensic Office issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of the death was a bullet wound in the head that reached the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana state police fugitive unit, the state police's criminal lab, the Southern University police are the neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked local law enforcement for his "diligence and search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 draw was created in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade declared that the team was "abducted" and "stimulated" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano throws gray over Mexico City
The ashes cast by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center advised Mexicans on Saturday to move away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was overseeing several shocks and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray on the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in volcanic activity located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck downtown Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Confrontation between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters faced riot police and as thousands of people joined rival protests to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked proseparatists held by the anti-disturbance police shoved eggs and painted in dust that created dark dust clouds in the streets that are often attracted to tourists.
There were also frictions later that same day with the police, which used the pores to contain the lyorta.
For several hours, pro-independence groups who choreographed "Neither forget nor forgive" faced unionist protesters shouting "Long life to Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received in the protest, according to local media.
Tension continues to flourish in the independentist region a year after the October 1 referendum held by the Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, although participation was low and the opposition to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would achieve independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy to be able to vote, but now we are exhausted,” he said.
Despite obtaining an adjusted, albeit decisive, victory in the regional elections last December, this year the Catalan pro-independent parties struggled to keep the momentum, with many of their best-known leaders in a self-imposed exile or detained pending trial for their participation in the organization of the subsequent referendum and declares impeachment.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of police with his mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
“There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run for European Parliament elections the following year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Car Rises Against Home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry house on several occasions.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. (DST in the UK).
Police investigating inspector Bob Blemmings said the building itself was damaged.
It is also possible that a bullet fired at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
Ascended Livingston surprised the Rangers, leading Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to rise to a level after the Hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team remains homeless this year at the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, the Hearts, from which they split eight points.
But the Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to be unbeaten in the division for the sixth consecutive game; the head coach, Holt, has not yet known the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler or me past.
Livingston leaves opportunities to escape in the face of weakened visitors
Holt's team had to advance much earlier than they scored, as with their control they caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way but his crossfire did not cross the threshold of the gate; then, the shot of Alan Lithgow came out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the gate.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put visitors at risk in the standing ball games.
That’s how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers conceded a free shot and Livingston made a draw in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson united their efforts to fix the Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the possession but faced an impenetrable defense that prevented Liam Kelly from much work.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Rangers guard Allan McGregor stopped with a shot of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball out in another standing ball game of Livingston.
Many crossings were made in the Livingston area which were continuously dispensed, while two penalty requests were rejected: one by hand and the other by an entry from Halkett to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont to BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
It was a great performance and a great result for Livingston.
"And unanimously, they were excellent and they continue to exceed expectations in their ascending trajectory.
His style of play and players have only changed since he returned to the highest category, but part of the merit is from Holt in the way he has driven the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, superbly led a perfectly organized defense while Menga gave them no breath throughout the game to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerrard's orders, this time they did not reach that level.
They failed the last pass. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. All an antenna call for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during a meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to settle relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of Erdogan's supporters approached to see his president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive it in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflect the division in front of a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies in collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a transited street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 p.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a runaway atropel on Childers Street just over a mile and a half from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family members.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted and they are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in a high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The disturbance started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 p.m. (DST in the UK) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, involving eight inmates who are contained in a pavilion.
Officers were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesman said: "Prison staff specially trained to face a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin have been dismayed.
Six members of the staff had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between grids.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison center had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-disorder officials had to go to jail to calm a riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (drought-affected areas could benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it is very likely to occur early next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix said in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm within a radius of 320 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that extended within a radius of 64 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Meteorological Service predict 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with insulated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 in the Arizona Mogollón Border.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Gran Conca could reach up to 25 or 50 litres, with possible total insulations of 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger from sudden flooding, Rosa's rain could be a blessing, as the region is heavily affected by droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. drought monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-largest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, which will still have hurricane force on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and head north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding cold water in the Pacific and thus losing strength.
For this reason, it is expected to hit land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at night on Monday.
It could rain heavily in some areas of Mexico, assuming a significant risk of flooding.
“Total precipitation is expected between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 250 l/m2,” reports weather.com.
Rosa then headed north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression, and then continues to climb across Arizona and enter south of Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what remains of it is the heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the Southwestern Desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains can cause sudden waterfalls and debris flows in the deserts, and land clearances in mountainous terrains.
Midsomer Norton aggression: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 04:00 (Summer Time in the UK).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remained "stable".
According to Somerset police, during the night three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area, respectively.
Officials asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the mobile of the incident.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'suffered the ugliness and anger' of the Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the Democratic Party’s reckless and scandalous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the ugliness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexually assaulting her decades ago, being adolescent.
Ford also testified in the trial on his indictment.
The president said on Saturday that that day the "Americans" were witnesses to Kavanaugh's brightness, quality and courage.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with a history of unbridled public service," he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while talking about the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
“We have five weeks to make one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don’t do the job, but I really do,” he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is to “oppose and hinder.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place before Friday, a Republican party assistant told CNN.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia cause hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke down on the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke on the ground at the Luscofusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in its passage.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were killed,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB, in a detention round in Iacarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, home, it racked everything it found," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs circulated by the national disaster management agency showed many tents and buildings destroyed, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes occurred in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched over Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, set at the end of a long and narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantitative" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels would fall below.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the debris of the demolished buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the casualties and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "totally paralysed and there is no information" from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday for not informing of the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, you can hear a man sitting on the last floor of a building ringing freneticly warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people who were on the street.
In a matter of minutes, the water shocks the sidewalk leading forward buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The quake and tsunami caused a major shutdown that caused communications cuts across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Authorities say the army has already started sending cargo aircraft from Yakarta and other cities, but the evacuees are still in urgent need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened but only for rescue tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's Tsunami casualties balance exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
During the journey that World Vision personnel traveled to reach the city of Palu, where employees sheltered in canvas shelters raised in the yard of their office, they saw scenes of total devastation, Doseba commented.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of assisting in the event of a disaster, some complained that they were preventing him from travelling to Palu to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only flow if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can open ourselves to international help, but that moment has not yet come.”
As the second night fell in Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, families and friends of the missing were clinging to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that aligned the depressing argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was taken out of a swamp.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was carrying two days under the rubble with her mother's body at her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, coached two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a person with extensive experience in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon said in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse among the paraglider community, he desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages showed only a grey mark instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages didn't deliver," he added.
<0x24>26,750 stolen while recharging a cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink worker who was charging a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
In a press release, investigator officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the car driver had emptied a cashier in the leisure complex and was preparing to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man “came running from behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the scene, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about your identity, contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye's pole.
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye's pole.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Being formerly known as Kanye West.”
For some time now, 41-year-old West is known by the surname Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change occurred before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
It will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, which cancelled her attendance for "emotional reasons," according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yee' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," West said that same year as he was talking about his album with the radio presenter Big Boy.
"So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to the only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is another of the famous rapists who changed their name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced he preferred to be called Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, was also caught putting and removing the script and using the mayonnaise.
AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
The president-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has pledged not to re-use military force against civilians when the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students is approaching.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he "will not use the military again to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were rooting across Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by giving monthly help to boys who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag the boys into criminal gangs.
U.S. should double investment in I.A.
AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, a former employee of Google, Microsoft and Apple, said the U.S. is expected to double the amount it invests in AI in view of China’s growing activity in the field.
The comments came after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even if the U.S. lacks a formal strategy on AI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the research budget in AI would be a good start, given that the other countries are far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next big advance in AI,” Lee said.
Duplicating funding could double the likelihood that the next AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent Chinese AI companies: Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-scoring American Othello player, and was later executive at Microsoft Research of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology contests as the Advanced Defense Research Project Agency's Robotic Challenge and asked when it would be next to help identify future visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government scholarships, Lee says.
"It is not China who is leading the academic leaders, but the companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university geniuses to work in AI.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
"I think they should offer residency cards to IA doctors," he said.
The State Council of China published its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an Artificial Intelligence Center that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been registering movement for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum if the country's name is changed.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece and block applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim of its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the result would reach the minimum 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum paper was: "Are you in favour of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of parliament said they would watch the vote and make it definitive.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority of the parliament.
The state election commission said that at 1 p.m. no irregularities were registered.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I come to vote for my children, our site is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted for the Macedonian referendum on the country's name change that would pave the way for its accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents mounted for boycotting the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our heads up and not through the door of service," Kavadarkov added.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the investment so necessary to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said a positive result would be the "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below demand.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television chain Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people surveyed planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent more a vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major coup for the pro-Western government's policy since it reached power in May.
See: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, crosses all of Brighton’s defense and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took Brighton to Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy to score the goal of the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before heading to open field.
Then Aguero was found surrounded by four green shirts.
He disbanded a defense before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English forward used the first touch area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is going through some problems in the pe," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We played for 55 or 60 minutes.
And that was when it happened.
We were lucky to have it at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in the Premier League confrontation.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball in the depths of Brighton field in that game.
He sent a beautiful pass to the hole on the right side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite pole.
The sneakers put the ball in the gateway before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer Wants to Celebrate the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the fight for elimination, there were not many reasons to force another title.
But a always-competitive Scherzer expects to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only there are implications in the elimination for the Rockies, which lead to an advantage match against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League's Western Division.
The Rockies secured at least one position of comfort with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still trying to close their first division title.
"Although we didn't play at all, at least we can touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with the other team would probably be playing at the highest level I played this year.
Why don’t I want to compete in this?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be opening on Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to believe that Scherzer is what launches in a situation like this.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his starting number 34, made another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch on Sunday on his usual rest day.
Washington's right is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 tickets this season.
Trump celebrates a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Supreme Court-elect Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of the result in the midterm elections.
"Let's play with everything we did in November.
We have five weeks to make some of the most important choices in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don’t do it, but I really do it and that’s why I’m fighting for big candidates everywhere.”
Trump went on to say, “Now you see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look at what’s going on right now.
And they are determined to regain power using any necessary means, evil, and messiness.
They don’t care who hurts, over who has to pass to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control and we’re never going to give it.”
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and obstruct."
"And they've seen that over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "annoyed, blinded, naughty and liars."
He listed the Senate Judicial Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong public comments.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mm-hmm, what?
No, mmm, no, hold on... It was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
He is not tolerant of those who express his opinion.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, the truth is, I wasn’t surprised too much.
After all, they are the last of a series of Labour MPs that we are not well received, and all to say our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she was decisively confronted with anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, casually issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice to the worker meeting in Nottingham East on Friday indicated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I have been a Labour MP, Friday night committee meetings have been exactly the same.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if ever it has started.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and considers whether all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, when comrades with whom he believed to share a similar political vision began to expect me to be portrayed and to adopt positions with which I would never agree, whether in terms of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly, and in fact it’s a little bit like what I say, there’s a tremendous riot and attacks on social media censoring central politics, saying I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
It’s not just about me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that go to me tend to be political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a stream of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every "non-confidence" movement or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower of sight.
Over the past few years, I have received many advices that urge me to keep my head tight, not to be so frank, and that then "everything would go well for me."
I didn’t go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago still being in school, led by the negligence of Thatcher’s government that had literally let my classroom down, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both being a local councillor and minister of the government.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused about my political stances and that I do not agree with the current leadership of the party.
To those who promoted Friday's motion, the only thing I would say to him is that as the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will dissuade me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an invict Ayr gets in the head
The last two attempts may have slightly altered the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this gentle Premier League match.
They are now the leader of the table and are the only invincible team out of the ten.
It was finally the superiority of his defense, as well as the risk, that led the team to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
"So far they've been put to the test in our match and we're still unsuccessful, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said: “I must admit that Ayr has taken advantage of the opportunities better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute rehearsal, transformed by Frazier Climo, put the Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given to the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot pitched a wrong pitch.
Climo increased the advantage for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time, transformed a shot into a solitary, leaving the 17-5 marker in favor of Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged pause for the serious injury suffered Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on pavilion and, from the start, Ayr advanced further through an essay by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card, and Melrose took advantage of having another player with a Bruce Colvine essay that was not consumed, at the end of a period of heavy pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for scoring Climo when he didn't have the ball, McPjherson scored an assay from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's mall.
Climo scored, as he almost did from the start, after Kyle Rowe picked up the launch in the David Armstrong area and sent it to the third line Gregor Henry to get the local team's fifth rehearsal.
The protagonist of Still Game starts a new career in the restoration industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after discovering that he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which writes and co-stars with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the finale, and it seems Kierman is planning another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': inner Bolivia expects court to make way to the Pacific
The sailors were watching a naval headquarters covered with aircraft in La Paz.
Public buildings wore a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are engulfed by the slogan: "The sea is our right.
Recovering it is a duty."
In a sealess Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict remains alive, as is the desire to resettle the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court decision on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the IXC ruling on gigantic screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will pronounce itself in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate the concession to Bolivia of a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia a reason, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the judgment of the IX comes only six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", says Chilean expert in international law Paz Zarate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could be screening late.
“The topic of access to the sea has been blocked for a long time by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined the goodwill left to him in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume the talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court would take an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile,” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this theme for political purposes.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong, says his nation will not proceed with nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was "a utopia" that continued US sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War could double the North.
In Washington, they resist accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows unveil the latest line of giant shadows that will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your collection of shades or completely cover yourself from the sun, do not look for more.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled in the hallway a series of extravagant accessories for their 2019 spring-summer collection that opened to the public in the purest fashion week of Paris.
The impossible shadows filled Instagram this summer and these designers brought to the forefront their most amazing creations.
The main piece of Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a wide tab imitating feathers that flooded the models' heads.
Among other large-sized accessories, there were studs, a wizard hat, and even a pine, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had the lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high seam.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving equipment, with glasses and tube, and the other a melted ice cone.
And if you're a fan of the fashion giant, you're lucky.
The fashion experts predicted that the giant hats could reach the stores.
The disproportionate shadows come just after the "Bomba", the ball hat with a 60-centimeter arrow that takes everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark that is behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has brought to the forefront another great creation: a beach bag of straw almost as large as the model attached to a swimsuit that takes it.
The orange rafia bag, decorated with rafia flocs and finished with a white leather wing, was the highlight of the spring summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at the Paris Fashion Week.
The designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope the shaders and large beach bags arrive at the stores next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills are Essential for the Citizens of the World
Scottish private schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that gets to his head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he will come to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the board and with the highest approval rates in private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an outstanding degree.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, shows that 72% of pupils received an honorary enrollment in Mandarin, while 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish also achieved an outstanding.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages are taking the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs and of all kinds.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 indicated that among the lack of knowledge of languages constitutes 17% of the reasons for employers to cover vacancies.
Therefore, linguistic skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that need languages.
Regardless of your chosen career, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will place a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
This is why it is so important to invest in language for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, the teaching languages differ according to the school.
Some schools focus on the most classic modern languages, while others are taught by languages considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of their children, private schools always have several languages to choose from and specialist teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
We cannot deny that at this time, in a global business environment, languages remain vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Board of Private Schools.
Lebron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the screenplayers who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The team's coach, Like Walton, announced that James will play the first game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
You still have to decide how many minutes you will play.
"It'll be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training early in the week, James was asked about his six-match schedule for the Lakers.
At this point in my career I don’t need pre-time games to be ready,” he said.
Trump's Elections Arrive in Virginia on YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaigning myths tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump’s five planned myths for next week, including stops in nearby cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation in pause for his candidate to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump’s mitin in West Virginia and how can you see it on the internet?
Trump’s mitin in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump’s mitin in West Virginia to follow through live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the issue of this week's trial to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who holds the Senate's confirmation vote for a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this series of myths is to help Republicans face the November elections with a new impetus.
Thus, these five myths that Trump will give next week are aimed at “dynamicizing volunteers and sympathizers as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible in the face of the campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
This evening’s mitin, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, the last in the polls.
“It’s not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the investigations,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday’s individual matches
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a totally invented sporting concept but in which athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this one.
So, where would you say the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I guess we take that as a little boost," said Jordan Spieth as he walked out at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four advantage points with twelve more in play.
Americans, Spieth said, feel like they have a little wind in their favor and a lot to encourage, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each has three four points.
Spieth proved lethal from the tee to the green and is preaching with the example.
These gutural screams became stronger as his round progressed, making a crucial putt to kick the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
When they got the putt that made them win the game at No. 15, they shouted a similar scream, the kind of scream that they think the American team is not yet out.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about your party," Spieth said.
It’s the only thing that’s left for these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four out of four and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they were also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way it seems to flow its energy towards and from the crowd, confirms them as rivals to beat on Sunday, and there could not be more popular players to win when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly released Sergio García, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first round finished with the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look at the interactions between the pairs, the tips they give, the tips they don’t, and the way they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and they have a significant advantage on the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA has the patience to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has an advantage of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods with difficulty climbing four points to the marker at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who seeks to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but were unable to cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they fit perfectly to defeat an unsuccessful Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 more categorical.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without pity or glory, showed occasional flashes of brightness, but has now lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome modes and five consecutive.
Justin Rose, who rested on the morning fourballs, reunited with his partner Henrik Stenson on the foursomes, catching a defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant breeze day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by earning two points on Saturday.
They scored a 2&1 victory over the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There were only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup where a team went four points in the individual, although as the current trophy holder, Furyk’s team only needs to empathize to preserve it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a Sunday counterattack seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if you have no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions increased its distrust of the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea took "important measures to show its good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, dismantling nuclear testing camps and committing to proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we don’t see the corresponding response from the U.S.,” he added.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first on our part.”
While Ri resumed the already well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to "gradual" denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it did with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to "denuclearize" the Korean peninsula while Trump secured North Korea's security.
North Korea has long been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first depose its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its coercive target, and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us wake up is an impossible dream for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions aggravate our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the other part of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead end.”
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after "male President" Trump called Kim "a man rocket on a suicide mission."
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Mr Trump said there was no deadline for this, and that "equally, it takes two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “Compliance with the Security Council’s sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had advanced, just hours after North Korea denounced him for making “mafia-like demands”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile deployment, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States took the "corresponding measures".
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was requesting were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new Harvard University course is making all of its students sleep more in order to combat the growth of the male culture of studying all night caffeine-stimulated.
One academic found that students at the world's number one university often don't know the basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and a specialist at Brigham and Muller Hospital, conceived the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl approached me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this only now, in my last year?’
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how acquiring good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and the university’s executive director of health services, said the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficiency affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are informed how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know this information, just as we have a right to know what the health effects are if we opt for tobacco smoking,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride of spending the whole night awake still exists, he says. And he adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students implying lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensure that you sleep enough and that you have a good quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, signals. Even avoid getting fat, as lack of sleep causes the brain to enter in inanitation mode, which makes it hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course across the campus.
The next step, he said, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to lie down, as well as for when they wake up. Likewise, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can try to unbalance the rhythm.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team intended to record their first home win since the 4–1 victory in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team led Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team eight-point Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premier League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the rest and a low-inspiring Rangers alignment never gave the feeling that he was going to empathize.
While the Rangers went down to sixth place, Livingston went up to third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a goal of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to deal with a head injury after allegedly launching an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that dragged Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was on the same 11th of Livingston that drew a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted in the way that his organised ensemble suffocated his opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first-time short pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goalkeeper, but the midfielder wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to crawl him in the second paw.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Undoubtedly, Alfredo Morelos felt that they should have scored a 15-minute penalty when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only scored two shots at the door in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston's opening in minute 34 could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers failed again when faced with Jacobs' strong training.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit the ball into Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blood to choose Menga for a single finish.
Gerrard acted in the break by switching Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, a shift that almost had an immediate effect when the left made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded the advantage in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Ranger's substitute, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty by wrestling with Jacobs, but Thomson again made his sight fat.
Almanaque: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and TALK... it was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pier of science since then, Counter Geiger has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual vacuum scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Home: "What is this in the world?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "Say, I'm sure you're exploding right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Defective Cells
The new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer and re-inject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "impulses the growth of various types of cancer", including those of breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients and “teaching them” to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a speech in favor of Trump using a MAGA hat (Make America Great Again) following his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
And the result was not good.
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West was spotted in the studio after a confusing presentation in which she praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said she would run as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great Again hat, she criticized the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white man and say, 'How can you like Trump if he's racist?'
“If I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault lawsuits made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it didn't air, Chris Rock uploaded West's critics' footage to social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They walked with me in the backyard.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
We were intimidated!
And then they said I was going to pick up,” according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see how I'm going to piss?", saying that I'd "use my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments provoked clues in the audience at least twice and members of the SNL cast appeared to be embarrassed, he told Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave the publication: "The whole study remained in absolute silence."
They had named West as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left a lot of people perplexed with an interpretation of the song I love it ("I love it"), dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West got the support of TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for FRONTING THE MAFIA"
However, interview host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “being who he is and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
"However, I chose not to reward anyone (buying their music or clothing or supporting their 'art') who I think is embracing and sweeping an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
It's free.
Just like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "to be officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is attacking toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword handling role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the male stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen translate into that it seems that young people often have to be tough to respect them.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married co-star of Game of Thrones, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted to feeling "strong enough" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now. Where are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it’s really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the boys.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not do any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that "enough of horses and battlefields".
Starting in November, Kit will star a remake of True West, by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes his encounter with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way, it provided me with my future family and my life from here on out," she said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Leslie's Scottish family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities said.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in interannual terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of staff filtered data from Republican senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiratory theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and “ultraright” commentators.
"Lies, lies, and more infamous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information circulated included private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill, the U.S. government headquarters, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of inadequate sexual conduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The filtration appeared shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed information from a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill said.
“This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie,” Waters continued.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie.”
Waters' statement promptly sparked online criticism, including that of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This dismissal was done with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"I don't think he has the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When you accuse someone of something you didn’t do, you shouldn’t be angry.
It should not be challenging.
Do not question the prosecutor’s motives.
It must remain appreciable and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who came to dismiss Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's very hard to believe," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his department had alerted "entities in charge of law enforcement and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the culprits are discovered, as well as that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my team members."
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in action), Rowan Atkinson's powerless spy parody
It is now traditional to look for the transcendence of Brexit in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this may apply to the return of the franchise of this parody and action comedy by Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire about the matter of the obviously stupid that we are in the new export opportunity of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny English's incompetent eyeball character and rubber face renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that this is a general comic creation designed for non-Anglophone cinematic territories.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his extravagant claims of flattering glamour, has a little Clouseau, a Mr Bean whistle, and a shovel of that kind that contributed with a single note on the theme of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once portrayed in Barclaycard's now forgotten television ads, in which he sowed chaos in his passage.
There are a couple of good moments at Johnny English's last outing.
I love when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval armored suit and the rotor steps make a brief blow against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps into sight, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when these types of "serious" films, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems like humor was aimed at children, rather than adults, and in my opinion the extravagant misfortunes of Johnny English are not as ingenious or concentrated as the movie jokes change from Atkinson by embodying Bean’s character.
Now the permanently topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates Britain's supersecret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the distress of the agent who is in service, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the culmination for a pompous and conflicting prime minister, who is already suffering a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this character that almost looks like Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Their intelligence advisers inform that since all active spies have committed themselves, they will have to pull someone out of the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but gives extra-official lessons about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency informative session and meet his former and suffering partner Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
Batman and Robin of His Majesty's Secret Service mistakes return to action, encountering the beautiful fatale femme of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the charismatic multi-billionaire technology who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous haircuts: disguised as waitress, set on fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; create a riot that illegally puts them on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use some virtual reality helmets to get acquainted with the interior of Volta.
Obviously, all the arrests come out of that last sequence, but in the kind and scandalous way that it is, it seems taken from a children's television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help thinking: can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to her talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but charges for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but that they will pay for five.
Presumably, the party wants employers to spend the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution on workers by offering them an additional free day.
In this way, employees would enjoy a weekend of three days, but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "adjust" the party's economic agenda and its plans to incline the country in favor of workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported the four-day weekly turnaround as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“It won’t happen day and night, but a four-day working week is an ambition that adjusts to the party’s approach to balance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the party’s general industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party does not support the ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week does not enter the party’s policy and is not being considered by it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “speculators” in public service companies.
The chancellor's plans in the shadow also imply the possibility that current shareholders of water companies will not recover all their investment, as a labor government could make "deductions" due to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on the boards of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector companies’ shares to employees, which envelop annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least a week's final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether the department's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw his support.
On Sunday, in an interview, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"They say I'd go to the audience. I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after he left the charge and asked him if he had done it.
It was firm, determined, rotunding.”
However, Graham’s vote seems immutable.
“My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and I would make an explosive accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett denies it roundly," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“The people you mentioned couldn’t verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive poster of acting stars and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people attend the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event to end poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the attending public had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other significant way to help.
But what is the degree of success achieved by Global Citizen after 12 years of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to ask for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism", people who think it makes a difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its followers, driving a set of different goals.
It states that these actions helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion set to influence the lives of more than 2,250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and ads derived from its shares, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and executor society that has pledged to "help children develop to their full potential," with the promise to provide Rwanda with <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than <0x24>4 million globally.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities, and Global Citizen sympathizers like you, we can turn social injustice from malnutrition into a footnote of history," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on your website, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult journey and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But in the same way as with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favour of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve this, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy to carry out a "blocking" to hamper Russia's energy exports, the U.S. Interior Secretary said.
"If necessary," Washington may resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including that of the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at legitimate government instances, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe," he said.
In addition, according to the officer, they have the means and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the sea, to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "power consumer's voice" in the US.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, taking into account that in practice it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of exploiting and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as saying that "there is only one tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia's, the most economical option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said turned Berlin into a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was set to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow.
The position of the United States resulted in Germany’s reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry’s leading organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the U.S. to move away from the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," BDI president Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Carefully Examine Her Candidacy for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully examine her presidential nomination after midterm elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and reopen the fractured government and that includes a woman in power,” she said.
"On November 6th, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was "leaving this country in the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course, an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters don't believe it's going to run in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator would not submit her nomination, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent voted for the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of the Democrats in relation to a possible 2020 nomination include former vice president Joe Biden, and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide it before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder (TEPT) in Donald Trump’s mitin
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of TEPT and some of the wounds that our soldiers are returning with," Trump told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo issue and that his son and other war veterans “return differently, hardened, wondering whether there is respect for what militia and aviators, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal in relation to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a court-friendly report in Washington to support a politically challenging asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff’s Grace’s Sessions v. price that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
Detention in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace-supporting states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be granted according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition violates that principle," the court's friend said in a statement.
The taxpayers continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects entry of immigrants damages the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they “provide labor.”
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and the violence of criminal organizations.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been destined to alleviate all the problems (even all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a career to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse and worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her febrile baby in the evacuation center of the abducted city of Palu.
Every minute comes an ambulance with bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their homes destroyed, collecting their nestled belongings, trying to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, rested outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The eyes were blinking as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in a booth in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help, and then only silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Abuse with “Propaganda Ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper preaching the benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, referred to the China Daily payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, the state’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. Congress on Nov. 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election has marked what officials in the country have cited on Reuters as a new phase of Washington’s growing campaign to coerce China.
While it’s normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war witnessing tariff leveling on their respective imports.
According to China and U.S. experts, China’s countervailing tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to harm exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
In an opinion paper written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, it was exposed that China "is intensifying that harassment campaign by spreading propaganda advertisements in the free American press."
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the well-established American tradition of freedom of expression and the press by publishing a payment announcement on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in the newspaper post located at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the disparate opinions the Chinese can have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party.”
It also claims that "one of China's most important newspapers declined the offer to publish" its article, although it did not confirm which newspaper it is.
The Kavanaugh disaster causes women's Republican vote to lose a few days from mid-term elections
Although many of the leading Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, despite various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The reactions to these allegations were numerous and the majority of Republicans positioned themselves to continue with the vote.
"These things cannot be solved," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, said in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also said he doubted that the last minute of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the spirits of angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future nor in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, head advisor and national spokeswoman for MoveOn, said in the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the opposition, at the influenza of "Acercase November!", protested in the Senate corridor, while Republicans, under the control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
“The Democrats’ motivation and enthusiasm will exceed any expectations,” said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"It's already high,
But it goes even more, especially among the indecisive voters in the neighborhoods or those between the ages of 18 and 29 who, although they don't like the president, don't usually go to the polls."
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said earlier this week on NBC News.
"This goes beyond the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench of the defendants or not. The problem is how the Republicans handled this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that assists in the election of Democrats on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between believing the testimony of Ford or that of Kavanaugh, although they tend to support the latter more.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of the respondents fully or probably believe Ford’s testimony, compared with 35 percent who support Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh is more likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30 percent who think Ford is the same.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations filed by Ford, as well as those from at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of drunkness when she was 17.
On the contrary, Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her the genitals at a university party when she was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was fortunate that Inrupt’s intention was “to dominate the world.”
“We have to do it,” he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data warehouse" or POD.
Contact lists, pending task lists, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools may be included.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data warehouse unique is that the user has complete control over who can access that information.
The company qualifies this as a “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to its president, John Bruce, is that the company brings appropriate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM-owned security company, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said neither he nor his team spoke to Facebook or Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would change their business models from day to day.
“We don’t need your permission.”
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has stood up as an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Hommage to Bernard Vann, a clergyman decorated with the Victorian Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman who was decorated with the Victorian Cross during World War I received a posthumous homage in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was murdered by a sniper four days later without knowing that he was granted the highest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were tasked with discovering a memorial in his honor at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, emphasized the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather's feat that earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the spell of an intense gunfire."
Later he hurried to reach the fire line and, with a "great courage", headed the line forward before rushing with a cannon and no one's help, and shot down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was assassinated by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something he could never live with, but a lesson still.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a flower crown after the parade, which led the youth band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honoured to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig gives MMA fans the roll at the best time
Imagine you’re spending the entire night awake to enjoy the full Bellator 206 show, and when it gets to the best, something stops it.
The San Jose cartel included 13 battles, six of which were major, and was being retransmitted live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were going to see their faces, UK viewers were perplexed when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some did not impress them after spending so many hours smart waiting to see the fight.
A fan described the change to these children’s drawings on Twitter as “a very unpleasant joke.”
"State regulations govern that content wasn't appropriate for 6 a.m., and that's why it had to change to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of Marketing and Communications, when asked about the retransmission.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will take UK viewers into account in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think of repetition," Coker said.
"But if it's 6 a.m. there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which is already Monday for them.
We are working to find a solution.
When the change took place, I began to receive many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical error.
No, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to limit ourselves to five fights, instead of six. We wanted to give our fans the maximum, but we passed and
It's a lot of anger."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior due to his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old says he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he got to college.
Invited to the first broadcast of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a parent helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of this program, is down for illness.
As a guest of Laverne's first program, Daley shared that he felt "lower" than the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable for boys and girls to like you."
"To this day, that feeling of inferiority and of being different is what motivated me and gave me the strength to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was “someone” so people wouldn’t be disappointed when they discovered their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “was all a surprise.”
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them have never been a problem.
"When you live so much in so little time" (with only 14 years of age he first participated in the Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone your age who has experienced similar heights.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth caused Daley to completely change his perspective.
“If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal,” he said.
"But now I know there are things that are much more important than an Olympic gold medal.
"My medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley's father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked for his son was a ticket to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him I wouldn’t be here to occupy that first row,” Daley said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that very moment, at the moment of his death, when I realized that he was not really invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment, I knew that was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country by participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
The choice of Heather Small's Proud song is also not in van, as it is the melody that accompanied her during her preparation for the Olympics and still puts her hair at the forefront.

A Mickelson in low form ended up in the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will need to improve his technique so that it does not become an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participated in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed in the bench at the decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in Saturday’s fourball or foursomes.
Instead of being the center of action, as many times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day animating and working to improve his movements.
Although he has never been the most precise of the players, not even in the rough moment of his career, his 48-year-old does not fit into the adjusted Le Golf National field, where high grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And if that wasn’t enough, Mickelson faced Sunday’s ninth match to precise Francesco Molinari, the winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points below at the start of the 12 individual games, start with a good footing, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted her husband, although he couldn’t say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role I played today, gave me a palm on my shoulder, passed my arm and told me that tomorrow I would be ready," Furyk said.
“I had complete confidence in myself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think I’d play two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end that's how things are and so we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in the highest number of Ryder Cup matches.
He could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual palmares.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangible to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, with a sense of humor and he likes to get along with people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I like to see how well the youngest players have been with him this week.
It’s a lot more than a good player.”
Captain of Europe Thomas Bjorn fears the loss of advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup individuals can easily become an unpleasant journey.
The Grand Danish debuted in 1997 in a game in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but ended up reaching the goal line with a minimum lead by winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You still think we had a big advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won for a while," Bjorn said in the photo, after watching the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story shows that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go for it all.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are on the marker.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I'm not tired of saying that, I'm focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enchanted by his players' performance on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before.
Tomorrow we meet the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and there too we have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a partner next door when things go well, but when you're faced with things individually, then put to the test your ability as a golfer.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, that they get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will want his players to have a better individual performance than his comrades, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three four points.
Furyk himself was on both ends of the last day's rounds, being part of the winning team in Brookline, but ending up as a loser in a European miracle in Medinah."
"I remember each of the damn words," he replied when asked if he remembers how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, met the players on the last day.
“We have 12 important games, but you’d like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see the impulse going in a direction, there is a lot of pressure in those intermediate matches.
We prepare our alignment taking this into account and we put the players as we thought we would, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the ranking.
“I decided this order because I think it covers all the way,” Bjorn explained about his selection for individuals.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The newest German Navy fragata should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old Cold War warships, but will not arrive until at least next year due to defective systems and the increasing cost, local media reported.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class flaming fragatas, was postponed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman told Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technology of concealment, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy the newest fragatas up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit well points out, these continuous delays mean that the warships with the latest technology, and that will allow Germany to project their power overseas, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 was news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known of the reasons behind the return, but German media spoke of "crucial software and hardware defects" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel needed in the former Bremen-class fragatas.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is estimated to weigh twice as much as the similar class boats used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes the formation of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have already reached the amazing amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3100 million, compared to the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2200 million.
The problems of the newer fragatas are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is making waters.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of boats capable of deploying.
The officer claims that this problem is growing, as the old ships have been removed, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust spies the secret life of the bats
A new research that is being conducted on a Scottish Highlands farm aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipstrellus, as well as the Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
A sound analysis performed by experts of all recordings will determine the frequency of the call of the bats and what each species is doing.
Next, a habitat map will be prepared to create a detailed picture of the landscape of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, expects the results to show which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of lawns and what is the best way to keep the forests for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and the loss of habitat.
Aerogenerators and lighting also pose a risk, as well as traps with glue for flies, some chemical treatments of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
The squirrels are not blind.
But because of his night hunting habits, his ears are more useful than his eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated eco-localization technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct surveys, inspections of children, and sometimes even rescues.
The organization even has Scotland's only and first shrimp reserve on Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten shrimp species.
David Thompson, Estate Manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Threave we have a great area for bats," he says.
"We have ancient buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there are a lot of things we still don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks on the properties, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single child of maternity could kill up to 400 females and infants, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Moths are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
"There is still a lot to learn about bats and, in the case of many species, we don't know how it's going to its populations."
Ronaldo rejects lawsuits for rape and his lawyers prepare to sue the German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo qualifies the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get to know themselves using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these allegations.
The leader of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
The footballer allegedly paid the woman <0x24>375,000 to say nothing about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Hours after his publication, 33-year-old Ronaldo tagged this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
“No, not a thousand times not.
What was said today is false,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said before the camera.
“People want to get to know me using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous with just saying my name, it's part of my job.
I am a happy and respectable man,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they call "an unacceptable statement of suspicion in the privacy area," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019, in a suite of the Las Vegas Palm Hotel and Casino.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her yearly, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, turned himself up saying that he was a 99% knight, but that 1% betrayed him.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that both have maintained sexual relations consented by both parties.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she had photographs of the wounds, but later reached an extrajudicial agreement because she felt threatened by retaliation and was concerned about public scrutiny.
The 34-year-old woman says she seeks to revoke the deal while continuing to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Car manufacturers would leave the UK <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK said on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"It is necessary to reach an agreement," Clark added.
The Japanese automaker said that if Brexit did not reach an agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which is responsible for the manufacture of Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150 000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnessing how production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain if there is no agreement on Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is very tight, every 37 minutes pieces from UK and EU suppliers arrive for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and there could be delays and scarcity of pieces.
The company says it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal rhythm for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "precisely calibrated to avoid such border controls."
"It is essential to have an agreement. And we want it to be the best deal, so that we can enjoy the current success but also take full advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains."
Toyota could not estimate how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce plant competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year Burnaston employee and union coordinator of Unite, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “By experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
A government spokesman said they had presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
The White House said the high-risk meeting between Donald Trump and Under-Secretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed by one more week due to the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Advocate Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the ties between Russia’s and Trump’s aides, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General, or not, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence, fueled the rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein talked about using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of destituting the president through the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But he went to the White House last Monday, among reports indicating he was about to resign.
A meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judicial Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is not yet a fixed date, it could be this week or a week later, given everything that is going on in the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, but you know I like the press being informed.”
Some journalists questioned that claim, as Sanders has been carrying out since September 10 without holding a press conference.
When Chris Wallace asked why,
Sanders said the lack of information sessions was not due to an aversion to reporters’ grandilocution, although he added that it would not be her who denies that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not cite any source that endorsed the data.
Information meetings will continue to be held, Sanders said, but insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States, that's much better than addressing the questions to her.
“You are witnesses to how we’ve been doing this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can talk directly to the President of the United States.”
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with dignified visitors.
However, solo press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions in front of the journalists gathered.
A letter from the health secretariat to calm the mood for Brexit
The health secretariat sent a letter to EU workers at Scotland's NHS expressing their country's gratitude and communicating their desire to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has pledged to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment have continued, and decisions are planned to be reached this fall.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also intensified its preparations for a possible situation of no-deal.
I know this is a time of uncertainty for everyone.
That is why I want to reiterate how valuable the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Companions from the European Union and beyond, provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a linebacker for the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessean reported.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State coach, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
He seemed to have gone off when he reached the line.
Coaches and medical staff gave him oxygen on the tape before taking it on a camel for a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician told Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Also, he added that there are no details about the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when that injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year Red T-shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made a total of five appearances on Saturday before leaving the game, raising his total of the season to 18.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The tax increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on high-income people.
The increase in stamp tax will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will be used to support the government’s campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The charge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second homes and the purchases for rent, can be up to 3%.
Facenda expects the change to reach up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13% of new constructions in London are marketed by non-residents in the UK, which is causing price increases and making it harder for people who want to buy a home for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "fantastic cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson applied for a tax cut to help new people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping housing prices high by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenues on moderate-price houses to settle the "shame of the housing sector" that lives in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of housing-related reform proposals, including the control of tenants and the banning of deficiencies in which the tenant is not to blame.
He also wants to give the municipalities greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
"Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, it is necessary to arrange the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it turns out as easy for those people who do not live in the UK, as well as for overseas companies, to buy housing as well as for UK residents working.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity it assumes not to have a roof remains too real.”
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his "last ambition" is to become Scotland's picker at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of reviving the Northwest club, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in team B, and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a kid, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will come only if I succeed in directing a club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he has not felt any concern about the success of such consolidated figures in such a big club after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Will success for me at this time depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
"Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly the property of a Premier League club," he said.
"It's not going to be an easy task to get there, but you're likely to think that I've been successful here only if I can return the club to the Premier League."
Ross spent only three years as a coach after a period of assisting at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months within Hearts' technical staff.
During that period, he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St Mirren move from being downhill to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I was probably in a royal crossroads," he recalled, about taking charge of Alloa.
“I really thought that training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange because it wasn't bad for me, I gained reasonably well life and enjoyed some successes.
Playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you need to overcome every week.
I continue to suffer from them in relation to the stress and pressure of work, but I like to train.
I’ve always loved training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a picture is at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heatwave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 percent increase in July, but consumption in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent according to figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA commercial advisory board, who compiled the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's stay in the soccer world for longer than expected caused a pattern similar to that of June in July, in which pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in their food consumption.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurants’ business volume during June worsened during July.
Pubs and bars specializing in beverages were the best results obtained with higher consumption increases than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Pubs specializing in meals also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It’s like people just want to go out and drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, beverage consumption increased by 6.6 percent over the month, and food consumption decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, employee of RSM's leisure and hospitality analysis company, said: "These results suggest a continuation of the trend that has been happening since the end of April.
The time and impact of the main social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in the consumption-related outside of the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent annually will be especially painful if added to that the continued increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have arrived at a worse time for the restoration business and the weather will be in charge of saying whether the moderate temperatures experienced during August will provide the necessary breath for the sector."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.

A survey of 20,000 high school students highlighted an increase in the number of “fake insta” accounts (referring to the Instagram photo sharing social network).
This news has caused an increase in fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they used a softened "main" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who came across the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage girl who asked for her to be raped.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls aged 11-18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the council of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from their wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys tremendous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will greatly benefit from its membership in the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm looking forward to becoming a spokesman for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games among a total of four Olympic gold medals and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered an apoplexy.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and to what degree.
It was exhausting work, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and I am currently doing axility exercises.
“Thank you for the message of encouragement.”
An announcement of a breast milk extractor in comparison to cow women shares public opinion on the Internet
A maternity milk extractor company shared public opinion on the networks with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows they are moving to.
To announce the launch of the world’s “first silent portable breast milk extractor,” Elvie released an ironic announcement in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom that the new breast milk extractor offers to mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a ugly barn for the cows at the rhythm of a song with lyrics like, "Yes, I've taught myself, but I don't have a tail" and, "If you don't realize, I'm not drunk, I'm my breasts."
The choir continues, "Mox, mox, I'm feeding the babies, mox, mox, I'm mowing my friends."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, provoked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 plays and hundreds of comments, the video provoked different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that this manifests the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to be able to produce milk, but in their case, we steal their children days after giving birth.”
The Elvie Milk Extractor can be placed discreetly within a maternal subject (Elvie/mother)
Another spectator commented: “Clearly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But if so, why not be used to advertise a milk extractor for the mothers who are left with their babies?”
Another spectator added the following: "What an announcement with so little touch."
Other viewers defended the ad, even a woman said the song seemed "very funny".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If you were still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
Getting out of my milk made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is a bit crazy, but I interpret it as a joke.
I think it’s a great product,” he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad for mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in the bathroom) and feel like "vaccines".
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, this group of women reveal that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be fitted discreetly into a mother's bra, which gives women the freedom to move, to suck their babies, and even go out there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and creative executive director, commented: “Elvie’s extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In describing the parallelism between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges that it involves while demonstrating in an entertaining and close manner the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time Elvie has occupied the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the passageway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for the children to allocate paternity.
Traditionally, most fathers were also paperless immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to remain in the country taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential parents and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that that data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Control Service, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had requested childcare without company.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal records.
"Nearly 80% of the people who are paternal or who are part of the household of these are illegally in the country, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That is why we will continue to chase those individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In order to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court before a month has passed since their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the refugee workers.
Many will appear by videoconferencing instead of in person to try to legalize their case before an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for receiving assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they become anxious or depressed, which can result in violent kidnappings or attempted escape, according to refugee workers and system reports published over the past few months.
Lawyers said these fears are increasing in larger centers such as Tornillo's, where there is a greater chance that the symptoms that a child is going through poorly go unnoticed due to their size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on U.S., France and Turkey’s occupying forces to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking to the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country being currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were illegally located on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would be "occupied in a timely manner".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "of all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions were given for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "spreading of irrational fears" that caused refugees not to return.
“We appeal to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement reached between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel bastion of Idlib has allowed political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the province, in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear limit dates" and expressed his hope that military actions would be targeted by jihadists, including the soldiers of the al-Nusra front linked to al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated."
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draw up a draft of a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions to ensure the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the work of the agency should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr Trump would achieve re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals will be waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
What would be “the most dramatic end of a presidency”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, prime-time audience indexes have multiplied by more than two, reaching 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million first-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million compared to four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable channel's audience ratings with 3.5 million viewers over the important nights.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, showrunner for ABC's "Designated Survivor" drama, who talks about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He replied, 'Because you make me laugh,'" said Mrs. Scovell.
There is entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, Washington’s plots can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, if migrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it assumes something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spending six hours seeing a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's <0x24>15,000 avestrum firefighter jacket described himself as "a suit full of scaffolding" and "the scornful scornful" Daniel.
I will not look at Super Mario again the same way.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, senior executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, a space that deals with changes in the characters and the daily argumental turns of the Trump show.
You can’t afford to miss an episode or you’ll be left behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, I was in the sun and a temperature of 26 degrees outside of home on the north coast of Kauai, but I was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to unleash as Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court pending a thread.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs at the time and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

External money comes to the morons to fund the nominations to the House for the election of half of the legislature
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is receiving a large cash flow due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two representatives in positions in the career to occupy the same position.
This newly reorganized district in Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his position in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is faced with another representative in office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely overrun the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that Republicans would manipulate the constituency of the old districts in their favor.
The electoral career in the new 17th congressional district has kicked off a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after achieving a marginalized victory in the March special elections for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which enjoyed widespread follow-up.
That post was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politics experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States valued the possibility of penalizing Salvador for its support for China, and then voted backwards.
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama would already recognize Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a pleasant meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked off the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have ordered the head of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, in a statement this month.
However, only the possibility of imposing sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, has been disputed.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively putting an end to any possibility of imposing sanctions on Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a symptom of the importance given to the administration, diplomats said.
The three American envoys returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations as long as the participants remained anonymous.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration and who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was maintained.
Studying History
The next negative case could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the case of a possible obstruction to Mr Trump’s justice, of which there is currently plenty of evidence in the public file.
Mr. Mueller is also conducting his investigation to find out whether Mr. Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to account for that body, just when he has to prepare for the election, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are many unknowns and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, like that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were determined to give a coup d'état against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that occurred afterwards.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy accelerates or retreats.
Americans are faced with several of these moments of inflexibility.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying water to the neck since this newspaper reported last year that he suggested to the president to record in secret and speculated that he was incapacitated for office.
Mr. Rosenstein stated that the Times' information is not true.
“How are we going to respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not completed or is not impartial or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And, above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that demands responsibilities to Mr. Trump?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my home, which was known to the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to grab Shabat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers received Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive scoring in Spain against Villarreal this same month, would place them in a very favourable position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from debuting this season to the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a trampoline to achieve more important things.
"It was a good point for us, as Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We entered the game believing we could get something positive and we reached a point.
We had the chance to win in the end, but in general, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
Next Thursday will be another big European night.
We hope to be able to reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they got a good result in their last game, but with the support of our audience, I'm sure we can fight to get a positive result.
"Last year was hard between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that occurred on the team, but there is an excellent environment at this time.
The team is good, the guys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget the past season and succeed.”
Women are concerned about savings for their retirement.
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had clear how they wanted them to be treated, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
Approximately half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide said they commented with their peers on the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10% said they would talk to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of her, but they’re not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance department.
You can start with the following.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t communicate your wishes to them in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family to remember where and how to receive care, since these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Among the long-term care financing options are a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a value-in-cash hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to designate a trusted person to supervise your medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You also have the opportunity to sign a notarial power to manage your finances.
You will need to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your parent has a medical emergency and is heading to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Please note in detail this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who take care of it?" asked Martin.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?

A man gets several shots with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle while walking back home after leaving at night.
The victim, aged about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she received shots in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 2:30 p.m. (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, killed at least 384 people, a figure expected to continue to increase.
Due to the cut of communications, rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closest to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Below we provide some key data about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Célebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Célebes, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency located along more than 300 km of coast to the northwest of the island of Célebes.
This region, an administrative region less than one province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of Central Célebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the high seismic Pacific Fire Belt, so it suffers regular earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra, on December 26, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them, in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Xava, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
In 2009, a 7.6-degree magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit the Mentawai Islands in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of people and killed approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people recalled the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami deaths.
There was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily dragged.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, 29, natural of Wasilla, Alaska, was detained on suspicion of a crime of domestic violence, to prevent the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and for resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin remains in preventive detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility premises with a <0x24>500 bail, according to KTUU.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, since" when asked, the chain reported.
Palin faces three minor A-type crimes, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and receive a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with a minor B crime, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
His wife accused him of slapping him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome he suffers after serving with the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia kills hundreds
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the death toll increases over the course of days.
The earthquake occurred just in front of Célebes Central, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos on social networks in which the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to apply a few-time death penalty to suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a punishment that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike track on Lower Manhattan West Side Highway Avenue, securing the lives of pedestrians and cyclists he encountered on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, taxpayers will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused them "intentionally" serious injuries, according to the notification of the request for a death penalty filed in the South District of New York.
Both crimes involve the possibility of applying the death penalty according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight murders in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by taxpayers in organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "notable planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago, New York's Southern District had not filed a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal New York case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed lack of regret during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he was feeling good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos he viewed on his phone according to the accusation.
He also requested to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He was convicted of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys responsible for representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision.
“We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a perpetual chain of guilt without a possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked taxpayers not to apply for the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in front of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics (when one of May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Ordinary MP Peter Bone said before the Birmingham demonstration that the UK "would have already left" the EU if Mr Farage were the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces to reconcile her party’s split rows has been highlighted by joining the Tories to remain in the EU to an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain the commitments of her Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, the opposition and the EU.
Their allies insisted that they continue to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the concentration of Solihull's Leave Means Leave movement that he wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that he should have counted on Mr Farage to assume responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If I had given him the job, we would be out of the EU at this time,” he said.
The Wellingborough Member of Parliament added: “I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan.”
Demonstrating his opposition to the EU, he said: “We do not fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Tories member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march, from which she said to reporters: “The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is not popular with the public opinion, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a message to Ms May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said in a statement that it is necessary to make politicians “uncomfortable” if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Currently, this is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray the Brexit decision and here we’re gathered today to tell them that we won’t let them out with theirs.”
In a message addressed to a crowd of enthusiasts, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU took a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour concentration in the city center.
A number of activists have posted posters with the Tories Against Brexit message following the group's launch this weekend.
Worker Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us they can have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a friction-free border, to enjoy a free market without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s an absolute fake.
The concept of Brexit does not exist,” he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or introduce himself to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider her presidential nomination after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a municipal session in a western town of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been focusing on speculation that positions her as Trump’s successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with its voters using the county format since Trump took over the presidency.
An assistant asked her if she was planning to meet the president.
Warren replied that it is time for “women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for that a woman fails in the presidency.”
An arrest was made in connection with the murder of Sims, the LSU player
Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the detention of Dyteon Simpson, 20, in a press conference held at 11:00 East Time.
They will post a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who was out in the pictures.
Sims, a 20-year-old man, was shot dead at the campus of Southern University in the early hours of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head and eventually died as a result of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde interposed to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present on the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 2-metre youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 titles last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton reaches the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas ranked ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who had left the pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered boxing first and let Hamilton run with traffic in the back of the group, which would be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxes one lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton forwarded him after several wheel-by-wheel maneuvers that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the interior poorly at risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver in the third corner.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and climbed back to seventh place at the end of the first lap on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led the race during much of this thanks to retaining his tyres to be able to go faster in the final and advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally entered boxing in the 44th round but was unable to advance any position in the last eight rounds, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a real knight.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two places,” Hamilton said.
Inappropriate body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in an act on Saturday for her insistence that she did not filter out Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, of sexual abuse.
In a speech in an act in West Virginia, the president did not directly speak of Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee and commented in his place that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that people were “miserable, repugnant and liar.”
“The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see outrage, when you see people who are angry and who are miserable, repugnant and liar,” he said.
“When you see these posts and filters and they say, ‘Oh, I wasn’t.
I was not.”
Remember me?
Dianne Feinstein, did you do any filtering?
Remember their answer... did you filter the document?: "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I was not.
Wait a minute.
“No,” she said, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent him a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak had come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't filter her story," Feinstein told the committee.
“I asked you to keep your confidentiality and do what you asked me to do.”
But his denial did not seem to fit the president, who commented on the following during Saturday night's event: "I tell you that body language was not appropriate.
He may not have filtered it, but he used the worst body language I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repulsive, they don’t care who harms, who have to atropel to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars scored the loss in Friday's Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the game back by 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored an early lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie embarked on the local set before Dwyer restored the Giants advantage.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third loss in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to go back to winning Dundee by 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three previous wins for the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal was scored in the 3:35 minute thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after an assist from David Rutherford.
In a stirring initial period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to score the scoring goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were ahead of the marker before the first break when he scored his second night goal at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard again scored the game by power play in the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen advance Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured victory by their team's fifth goal in the last half of the period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on an airplane can escape from an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered a hero after his death to make sure a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
The death toll is 800 and there are many missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to be felt in the area and many people are trapped under the cascades of the city of Palu.
Although his co-workers fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to abandon his position at the control tower of the violently balanced Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained in his position to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the exit track at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could allow hundreds of lives to be saved, Australia’s ABC News channel reported.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take you to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Break our hearts when we find out,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be thousands and the country’s disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise because there are many bodies under the cascades and many of them have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are plundering the mini-markets.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I call on all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says there is a missing person missing after a plane crash in a pond
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing person after previously claimed that the 47 passengers and crew left the plane that was sinking without incident.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working jointly with authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events continues to be unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed on the lake before reaching the landing track.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed along the landing track.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered with very little height.
“That’s extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers were able to move between the water reaching their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were screaming and frightened, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors who were working near the site on the improvement tasks of a dam also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to the coast before the plane sinks approximately 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline crashes registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
An analyst writes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor's office on Saturday referred to evidence in the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to recompile the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones demonstrating that Tellis was meeting with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his earlier claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When this data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the staircase on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers since about two weeks ago when he died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“It’s the end of her life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be seen for judgment by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception that the genre has by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that hip hop has drifted away from its origins with political messages and fighting social problems.
They want to get back to their roots and get combative hip hop to be popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York nurse sues a couple after a "racist" message
A New York nurse will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that she was not going to be addressed from her mother who complained she was "other black."
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed her anguish when she discovered that child caregiver Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, an "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nurse who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and expected a Filipina according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice paid for her workday and sent her home on Uber.
Maurice will now sue the couple for a compensation for the dismissal and demand a compensation of <0x24>350 per day for the six months of internal work for those who were initially hired even though there was no contract by means.
“Look, I want to show you that these things don’t happen,” he told the Post on Friday, adding later, “It’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism saying that despediring Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid of not being able to trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent me a message that I didn’t want to send to her.
He is not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a man whom they have offended, even though it was because of a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on!"
After comparing the lawsuit to an "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going for a person like that?
That’s not very ethical,” added the investment banker.
As the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
Paddington’s publishers feared readers would not identify with a speaking bear, according to a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It is difficult to get into the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It’s really fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
After affirming that his father, who worked as a camera for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "scary" after his death last year.
De Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family", added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous," he said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you’re proud even if you didn’t really do it.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Although he was a creation of his own and a product of his imagination, he always gave Paddington all the merit.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, his daughter was quickly taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that he was very ill, that he was not expected to survive.
“Then I got Nad’s call to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And he did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart latching were slowly consuming and leaving her body.
He died a long time ago and now he was dying.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to endure it.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, at that moment of struggle for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane with the other passengers, without being aware of the calvary she was suffering.
“No one has detected it,” he said.
"I had my head down and I was always looking down.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this impressive sense of solidarity for Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I wanted her.”
Afflicted women's posts to avoid suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that you can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs Davis, was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel like I have to feel every day,” he said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile illuminated any room.”
However, he left work before he died and was “in a very deep depression.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was what he found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis commented: “I have a continuing concern that a side effect occurs.”
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you are a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't comment on me being sad or depressed or anything like that," he said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas day touched the bottom (when the kids opened their gifts, did not make visual contact with them or anything).”
He claimed that his death meant a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: “He broke the family.
Desecrate us.
But we have to move forward and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on a wire as the FBI initiates investigation
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (a limited time and limited scope investigation), we might have been able to get a little bit of unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "storing up" because of the paralysis.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Their reluctance is due to a matter of deadlines.
If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be elected to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush was calling senators, putting pressure on them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI completes your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently occupies 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the bargain and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of deserters falls under Kim's mandate
The number of North Korean deserters destined for South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un's accession to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said 1,127 desertions took place last year, far from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people in charge of passing people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of the North's deserters finally offered South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul declares that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the largest border crossing with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone existing between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal emigrants rather than refugees and often repatriate them.
Relations between the north and the south (which technically continue to be at war) have improved considerably over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This took place after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of advances since then.
“If we don’t trust the United States, we won’t be able to trust our national security, and in these circumstances there is no possibility that we disarm unilaterally first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says she is not fit to access the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said it was not appropriate by its nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever behaved that way, I would call her hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when she was a teenager.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost screaming and speaking while describing his family and his school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, cataloging the charges against him as "a grotesque and coordinated reputation assassination" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not access the Supreme Court because he proved that he had prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in office and if Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court where you're currently," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Circuit of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the patient protection and health care law or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation views, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be annulled.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to go to court and wait for us to say, look how well,” Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise it.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and you cannot expel it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem commented to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do I?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but who developed a technique that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, I said to the person she was talking to, "Well, you're crying because you're thinking this.
But I'm angry."
And then, it continued.
It looks brilliant.”
Beams are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my sharpest memories of one of my first jobs in a men-dominated workshop, in which I began to cry with an impossible to describe anger, was that a larger woman grabbed me from the back of my neck, a distant upper that always caused me a slight fear, and drove me to the hole of the staircase.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll comfort you if they come to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on her presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was picked up on an off-marriage adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and was withdrawn from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider the idea of presenting herself to the presidency.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” I commented among laughs 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Some people call him "Brancaneves and the Seven Pineapples."
Because the campaign was advancing, it was delayed in raising funds, so he swore he would not enter the presidential race unless he managed to raise <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters donated <0x24>1,000 to male candidates would only donate <0x24>250.
"What do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not present a formal campaign, she was overcome by emotions (thankful to the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters instead of delegates, and angry with the existing sexism) that left her speechless.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder said of how the press reacted to her.
“You would think Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my pencil?
"Chorou?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China were outrageous and, even though the war is far from over, a distance between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by recording key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of <0x24>200,000 billion, taxing half of the items coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has counterattacked in the same way every time, the most recent rising tariffs from five to ten percent to <0x24>60 billion in U.S. products.
China has promised to imitate U.S. measures and it seems unlikely that the world’s second largest economy will immutate in the short term.
In order to get Washington to back down, it would be necessary to surrender to its demands, but to publicly back down before the United States would be much more embarrassing to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favour China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions necessary to initiate an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, an Asia-centered researcher at the Center for New American Security, a study center.
Syria is ‘listen’ for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore normality.
All the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods are now being given.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another 6 million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he said he would not accept conditional help from countries that support the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team by a 16.5-10.5 final score at the Le Golf National club located in the outskirts of Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States on European territory and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battle offered during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in hole 16 of par 3, losing his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has shined in all of his series, becoming one of only four players who have achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by Denmark's worst-rating player, Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world’s first-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups contested, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with the most tournament wins, with 25.5 points.
“I don’t cry often, but I can’t avoid it today.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m so happy to be able to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help,” García said after the European victory.
He passed the test to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in Sunday's singles match.
“It’s incredible how proud I am today that I have been able to defeat Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching that guy play,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, a 14-major winner, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems over the weekend not to get out of the streets except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, for a moment, they put the Europeans in trouble.
We're fighting.
I'll take my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, work with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I want these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
It's to get the hat out.
They were superior.”
