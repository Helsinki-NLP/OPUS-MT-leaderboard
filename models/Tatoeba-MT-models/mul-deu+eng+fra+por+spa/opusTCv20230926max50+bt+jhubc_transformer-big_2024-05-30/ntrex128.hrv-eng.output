Welsh MPs are concerned that they will "look like Muppets"
Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) were surprised by the proposal that they could be called Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) in the future.
This was due to plans to rename the parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Parliament from all political spectrums are concerned that they could become the subject of the message.
A MP from the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the name was "removed from Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp bullshit.
A member of the ranks of the Party of Wales (the great Plaid Cymru) said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to change the name, but that the MWP in speech could quickly turn into Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary committee, which is currently preparing the law to introduce the name change, said: "Of course, the final decision on how the parliamentary representatives will be entitled will be on their own."
The Welsh government's 2017 law gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that have found broad support for the rename of the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the name of the parliamentary representatives, the Committee was inclined to name the "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
MPs are proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach consensus could bring headaches to House President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and the establishment of committee systems.
During the debate on the law, MPs will have a decisive vote on the question of how they want to be called.
Macedonians to hold a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether they want to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The aim of the vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the initiation of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opposition plebiscite on the name change, said he would not recognize the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells were heard as churches in Harlem fight for survival
“The older people I’ve talked to have said that in the past there could have been a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“There is no one else today.”
He said the bar's disappearance was understandable.
“People come together in a different way today,” he said.
"Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly live."
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as church leaders think and "sooner or later they will find themselves at the beginning."
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people will live who will not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy homes in these buildings will be white," he said, "so the day will come sooner when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that residents who enter these buildings will become members of these churches."
Both churches built a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation was exiled in the 1930s.
The Black Congregation, which held worship in the vicinity, took ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by the Honourable John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of retailers at 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who opposed hiring or promoting black people.
The fire of 1939 severely damaged the building, but as the cemeteries of the Honourable Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor people.”
The expert who played the carillon in July used another name: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing a larger carillon at Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is taking place in St. Martin in the past few months is a complex story about architects and construction work performers, some of which were brought by lay leaders of the church, and others by the episcopal diocese.
Sacristy, the governing body of the parish made up of lay people, wrote to the diocese in July over concerns that the diocese would "try to transfer costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in engaging architects and performers of the construction works it sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the side of the diocese.
Sea Dog Injures 13-Year-Old During Dive In California
According to an official statement, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy as he sank behind a butterfly in California on the opening day of the butterfly hunting season.
Something happened before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boys call for help, and then drove with the group to the scene of the attack to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was about excitement because of the caught shrimp, but then he realized he was screaming, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said when he approached the boy he noticed that his entire key bone was broken.
“I made sure everyone came out of the water and said, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The captain of the rescue team, Larry Giles, said at a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto in Casablanca to Swamij in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of bathers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK’s beauty market
Sainsbury's is becoming a competition with chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic counters in the style of merchandise and by hiring specialized vendors.
As part of the large UK beauty market entry worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow compared to the decline in sales of clothing and home appliances on the market, larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores later in the year.
Investing in cosmetic products is one of the ways supermarkets try to make use of the space on shelves that was once foreseen for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s representatives said they will double the size of the cosmetic product range to 3000 products, including for the first time and brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for specific brands similar to stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its range of Boutique decorative cosmetics, so most of the products will be suitable for vegans, which is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, fragrance store Fragrance Shop will try to use concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and returning to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to work harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s CEO, said the outlets will look more and more like commodities as the supermarket chain tries to resist favorable stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s introduced Argos outlets to hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments, because it bought both chains two years ago, which allegedly encouraged the sale of livelihoods and made these acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to refresh its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's entered a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but this ended a dispute over pharmacy revenue sharing in his supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold its <0xC2><0xA3>125m pharmaceutical business in 281 stores in Celesius, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
Lloyds says it will play a role in the plan by including in four stores a range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the look and impression of our cosmetic departments to provide our customers with a more comfortable environment.
We have also invested in special training of colleagues who will be at the hands of customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all the needs, and the attractive environment and available locations means that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones 'Angry' After Holly Willoughby Gives Up <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million
Dragon's show star Den Peter Jones is left to "cook out of anger" after TV host Holly Willoughby quits a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with his brand to focus on her new contracts with the Marks & Spencer chain and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their brand of homewear and fashion accessories Truely.
Their brand is comparable to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon’s Den Peter Jones to cook out of anger by pulling out of a lucrative joint venture at the last minute to focus on her own splendid new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "raged" when a golden girl on television during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million meant she didn't have enough time to devote to their brand-new fashion.
This work was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and was meant to double Willoughby's worth estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truely, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
This was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to retreat surprised everyone involved in the business.
No one could have believed what was happening on Tuesday so close to the start of the whole line.
At Marlow's headquarters, there is a lot of warehouse that is ready for sale."
Experts believe that due to the departure of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars to invest in, the company could suffer millions of dollars in losses due to large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby's mother of three children and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truely with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as Chairman of the Board in March.
The couples spend their holidays together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the head of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We don’t want to comment on his business activities.”
Hard negotiations, and then we fell in love
He jokes at the expense of criticism in the newspapers for comments that some might consider "unworthy of the president" and for having such a positive attitude towards North Korea's leader.
“Why did President Trump give so many speeches?”
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news leader.
“I didn’t give any concessions.”
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But denuclearization negotiations have been stalled.
More than three months after a June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea's chief diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North had not noticed a "appropriate response" by the United States to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead, the U.S. has not yet lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
In his speech at the summit, Trump took a much more optimistic stance.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We are threatened by a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – interrupting trial rocket launches, helping to free the hostages, and returning the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of waiting for 10,000 people in front of this crowded arena to enter, we’d have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok have been displaced, it is not a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about not seeking international help, so all this is a bit problematic," she said.
Although Save the Children is a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disasters Office, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to engage in aid efforts.
Given the constant soiling in Indonesia, this country is still unfortunately unprepared to cope with the anger of nature.
Although shelters in the case of a tsunami were built in Aceh, this is not something that is common in other parts of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in force, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best time travelling between numerous Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
A ship at a hospital in Lombok to take care of the victims of the quake is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of a new disaster.
Improving Indonesia’s collapsed structure was the basis of President Joko Widodo’s campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Joko is struggling with a lack of financial resources, and next year new elections are being held.
Yoko is also facing pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets with machetes, arrows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See also: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored a goal for equalization against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal at a 1-0 score for Chelsea.
He shifted the ball to his left leg before shoving it to the opposite triangle.
The ball flew high above the naked to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepaja Arrizabalaga who jumped towards her and entered the net.
“It was challenging to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea led in the semi-finals with 1-0 after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward handed the ball back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> during the match before turning somewhere in the middle of the field and running to the Liverpool half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> performed a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he pointed a beautiful passing ball that Hazard led to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and left foot hit the ball in the net on the opposing bench next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play a club match against Naples in the Champions League at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will welcome Videoton to the UEFA European League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the state disaster office said on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a news conference that a large number of people were trapped in the building's ruins after a 7.5 magnitude quake on Friday caused waves up to 6 meters high.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is full of ruins.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after his wife was beaten to death.
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. with deadly wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people from the area to call if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still at the beginning, but I would like anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
"I would like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived on the scene who thought they knew the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said that the nearest relative of the victim is also being reported.
The taxi driver who lives at Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter the building or exit it.
He didn't say a word when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take several hours before they can return to their apartments.
The policeman allegedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the crime scene in tears.
He keeps saying, “That’s so terrible.”
At 14:00, two police vans were located in the fenced area, and another was parked directly outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and oversaw the residential block.
Anyone who has any information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, referring to Minutes 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament is the latest monument that has been trapped in the midst of a debate about "passing history"
His pursuit would be poetic justice for the almost Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts executed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt "stupid" and "an attempt to overlook history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate that is currently taking place on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of Westminster Palace would become the subject of debate.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars is not something that Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful revival of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the 19th century’s thinking and part of the historiography of a person that many still consider to be worthy of honor.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressure.
Whether this is a fully credible opinion is the subject of the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of the division.
His achievements in the role of Lord Protector are still worthy of tribute and honour."
Pig killer kills Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, the pig attacked and killed farmers in a market in southwestern China.
A man named "Yuan" was found dead in a carved artery and covered in blood near a stop at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to a South China Morning Newspaper on Sunday.
A pig breeder was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He was reportedly travelling with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning a relative found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was opened.
He said there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms bited the breeder to death.
Guiyang's evening news reports that a relative who was nicknamed "Wu" stated: "My cousin's legs were bloody and stabbed."
A video from the security camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked in order to prevent it from attacking someone while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market administration are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely occurs, pig attacks on humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked his wife and wife on their farm in Massachusetts and his husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig caught a Welsh farmer with a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs were eaten by farmers in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of the blood can act as an "oddifier".
“They’re just playing.
They're picking, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it crosses the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rains over the coming days in northern Mexico and southwestern United States.
At 05:00 Eastern time, Rosa flew at 140 km/h, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is created above the Pacific and is moving towards the US West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula in the form of a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to suppress a deep layer of tropical moisture in the direction of the north-southwest AD.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture in interaction with the approximate low pressure area will cause strong precipitation to occur in much of the southwest.
In local areas 25 to 100 mm of rain will be caused by hazardous floods, mud buoys and possible slopes in the desert.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause precipitation to occur, which will be about 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain from 25 to 100 mm in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Floods are possible with a rapid deterioration of conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall.
It is not advisable to go in the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into swampy rivers, and mudflats will bring local stormy winds and dusty sparks.
Approximation of low-pressure areas will bring local heavy rains on parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to water more than 12 mm, which can cause less mud buds and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the wet season in the region.
Tropical splinters will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday late in the evening and on Monday early in the morning before covering the wider area at the end of the day on Monday and on Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend to areas touching the borders of the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah on Tuesday and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes are possible across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will continue to grow and spread again.
It is expected that in most of the central and eastern U.S. in early October it will be warm with 27 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests the great possibility of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched six television networks on Thursday the tense testimony of Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political accounting has continued, and reporters have interrupted a regular program to report a reversal at the last moment on Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate jury that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had been pissing her drunk and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his heartfelt testimony that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
The hearing on Friday was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number stated in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other networks that transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring the number of people watching content in their offices.
To make it better for you, it's about an audience that's in number similar to the one that watches American football or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest number of spectators with an average of 5.69 million during a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC occupies second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
There was still a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras filmed him screaming as he tried to take the elevator to the Justice Committee hearing on Friday morning.
He stood for a few minutes with a distracted gaze as he was spotted in front of CNN's live cameras by demonstrators.
“I stand here before you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?"
They said to him, “You have power while so many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office had published a statement even before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks watched live when the Justice Committee was due to vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh for the entire Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on condition that the FBI investigate charges against candidates over the next week, which were demanded by minority Democrats.
Flakes were partly convinced of talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “playing politics” with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, continued to criticize her so-called Chequers Brexit plan in a second interview with her on the front page, saying the proposal was that the UK and the EU should charge each other “the duty of deceiving customs duties.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrested Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested the suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on charges of accidental murder, Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials released a video of a clash between Sims and Simpsons, and police said Sims had lost his glasses in the clash.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, reported WAFB, a CBS branch.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he confessed to shooting at Wayde and killing him.
A <0x24>350,000 bail was requested.
The Eastern Baton Rouge office on Friday released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a median head injury through the neck.
The police department thanked the Louisiana Federal Police Refugee Working Group, the federal police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local authorities for enforcing the law on "perseverance and search for the truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and 2.6 leaps per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash in Mexico City
The ashes ejecting the Popocatapetl volcano reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over a 24-hour period.
The center has been tracking multiple stunts and stunts.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windscreens of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometres southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflict between police and Catalan separatists marks the anniversary of independence voting
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters who advocated independence clashed with the intervention police and after thousands of people joined anti-democracy protests to mark the Catalan polarizing vote on the evacuation.
A group of masked separatists apologised to the intervention police and began shooting police with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fighting broke out even later in the day when the police used sticks to calm the fighting.
For several hours, the independence-promoting groups chanted “No Forget, No Forgiveness” and the unionists shouted “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital due to mild injuries sustained during the demonstrations, the local press said.
The tensions in the region, which are harder for independence, have not diminished even a year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid declared illegal, and which Catalan separatists celebrate.
A large majority of voters opted for independence although the output was small because those who voted against the evacuation boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in fierce clashes last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups spent the night on the streets Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he did not expect Catalonia to gain independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of luck for having been able to vote, but now we’re locked up,” he said.
Despite having achieved a crucial, albeit close victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan independence parties have hardly managed to keep up the swing this year because their most famous leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention, where they await a referendum on detention and are not waiting for a referendum for their arrest.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the clash was sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is all tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been imprisoned since late last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidating for the European elections is the best way we can announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car hit in house
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry house several times.
The incident occurred on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the courtyard door and the building were damaged.
It is possible that at some point an arrow from a monastery was fired on the car.
Menge scored Livingston's win over the Rangers with a score of 1:0
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston brought victory
The new Scottish Premiership League club Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his second defeat of the club's eighteen games at Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Menge's goal turned out to be decisive as Gary Holt's team scored against the Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team is still unsuccessful at this season's Premiership guests, and on Saturday they will play against Hearts, the leading club in the league behind which they are eight points behind.
Earlier this year, the Rangers in the European League will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not experienced a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunity against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead even before they reached that goal, given that their direct attack caused a series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but there was a stop on the way to the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after slipping to cut Craig Halkett's head kick to the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble to the guests
And that's how the key goal was achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop the free kick, and Livingston devised an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisting the Menga who scored in the middle of the goal.
By that time, the Rangers mostly had control of the ball, but faced impenetrable home defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the shot.
Ranger Allan McGregor's legs apologized to Scott Pittman, and Lithgow pointed a broad blow from another organised attack on Livingston.
Long additions failed to cross Livingston's goal line, and two eleveners were not awarded – after Halkett's clash with deputy Glen Middleton and one to play hand.
“Beautiful” by Livingston – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC at Tony Macaroni Arena
It's an excellent game and a Livingston score.
All of them were excellent, so they continued to exceed expectations on that entry road.
Their style of play and staff have barely changed since their return among the big clubs, but great merit goes to Holt and the way he has ordered the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at the forefront of the superbly organized defense, and Meng didn't allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to have any prey throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards that set a good game under Gerrard.
They failed to reach the ball to the end. They only opened a hole once in the home team and it's kind of a call to trade for the Rangers that are in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) there was a lot of smiling under the open sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They discussed opinions on issues that include human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
It is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police blocked a mass gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but a large number of presidential supporters appeared nearby to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, including a large number of Kurds, raised their voices condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Controversial demonstrations reflect the divide caused by a visitor whom some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others attack as autocrats.
Road crash in Deptford: cyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, on a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed after the crash and the driver escaped from an accident site in Chiders Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's crash site.
The city police said police officers were trying to identify the man and notify his closest relative.
Due to the accident, roads were closed and bus traffic was redirected, and motor vehicle drivers were advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Unrest
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in riots in a male detainee's prison.
The riots broke out at Long Martin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 p.m. on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special "Tornado" troops were brought to combat the unrest involving eight inmates and were limited to one wing.
Police officers were assisted on the spot due to minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel are engaged to deal with the incident in the Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were assisted by injuries.
"We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be handed over to the police and that we can spend a long time behind bars."
Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the prison administrator had ended up in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the intervention police were called to prison to solve a serious situation in which staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with thunderstorms (possible benefits for dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression strikes Arizona, but there is a likelihood that this will happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa will forcefully cross the Desert Southwest and bring the danger of flooding.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued warnings of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in the area from western Arizona, across southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach Phoenix late Monday in the rain and cross right over it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix tweeted that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have caused a tropical storm or depression within 320 kilometers of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) crossed 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50 to 100 mm precipitation, with isolated volumes up to 150 mm on the Mogollon border of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert southwest, including Stjenjak and Veliki pool, there is a probability of precipitation from 25 to 50 mm, with an insulated total amount of up to 100 mm.
For those beyond the dangers of the stormy floods, Rosa could come as a rescue because the region is affected by drought.
Although the floods are a major danger, some of these floods could be useful because the southwest is currently governed by drought.
“According to the U.S. drought map, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by at least extreme drought, the second highest category,” weather.com said.
Hurricane travel first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had hurricane power with a maximum wind speed of 130 km/h and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and was moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm hit the colder waters of the Pacific and weakened.
It is therefore expected that on Monday afternoon or evening, the coast of Mexico will be approached by a tropical storm.
The rainfall in parts of Mexico could be severe and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to the northwestern Sonora is 75 to 150 mm, possibly a maximum of 250 mm," weather.com said.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass across Arizona and southern Utah until late Tuesday evening.
"The main dangers expected from Rose or her remains are very strong rains on the Baja California Peninsula, the northwest of Sonora and the US Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will cause life-threatening floods and mudslides in the deserts and slopes on the mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with wounds was found in Somerset.
At about 04:00 BST on Saturday, an injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
The Avon and Somerset police departments said the 17-year-old, 2 18-year-old and 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police have called on anyone who has a video of the incident.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Suffered Wickedness And Anger From Democratic Party
“The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for rejecting the Democratic Party’s cruel and shameful tactics,” Trump said at an election summit in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered evil and anger” by the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday and decisively and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault decades ago when she was a teenager.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing on the charges she filed.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable public service career," he said.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination as he talked about the importance of leaving Republicans in mid-term elections.
“Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I am,” he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the mission of the Democrats was to “create resistance and occupation.”
A Republican leader's assistant told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected by Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami continue to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were pulled off by huge waves that hit the coast when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six meters high hit the shore, dragging many of them to death and destroying everything along their way.
Tsunami followed after a magnitude 7.5 quake.
“When a tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run away and were killed,” said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB disaster relief agency at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he pulled cars, debris, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived,” he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos published by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent strikes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could have been felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday matched the two-fold strength of the atomic bomb thrown at Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were demolished.
He also said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the building, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of casualties and damages may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"The communications have been completely interrupted and we have no information from Donggal."
"There are more than 300,000 people living in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers had been sent to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for not providing information that the tsunami hit Paula, although officials claim the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of the building panicking warning people down the street of an upcoming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall collapsed on the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The quake and tsunami caused a power outage that caused a breakdown of communications around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
According to the authorities, she began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still needed food and other necessities.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
Tsunami killed more than 800 people in Indonesia.
The situation is extremely bad.
"While the World Vision staff from Donggala successfully arrived in the city of Palu, where the employees were inclined to Tarpaulin tents placed in the yard of their offices, they passed scenes of destruction along the way," Doseba said.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched aid wheels in the disaster, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise have been prevented from arriving in Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supply and recruitment of staff from other countries can only begin if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says ‘Okay, it’s a national disaster,’ we can receive international assistance, but such a state has not yet been declared.”
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on Friday, friends and families of those still considered to be missing still hoped that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that eased the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from sewerage.
On Saturday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the ruins next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his disciples.
“Given the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel that expanded to the paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a grey hat, instead of two blue hats.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from Newport on the Levee
The robbers stole <0x24>26,750 from Brink's employees who filled an ATM in the center of Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
In a statement, Dennis McCarthy said the driver had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy, the other man “came in the race with Brink’s employee behind his back” and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses noted more suspects fleeing the scene of the theft, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to you
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In a tweet on Saturday announcing the change, he wrote: "Live will be officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes on the eve of his guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
The authors of the show said the show replaced singer Arianna Grande, who cancelled for "emotional reasons".
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West previously stated that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yee' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year in a conversation about the title of his album with radio director Big Boy.
“So, I am you, I am us, that is us.
It started from Kanye, meaning 'one', into only Ye—it's a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are.”
He was one of a number of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West's former associate, JAY-Z, was playing with versions of his name without a spelling and with a spelling and written in capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use the military against civilians
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge on students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square promised he would "never use the army against the Mexican people."
Military forces fired during peaceful demonstrations on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as leftist student movements began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those studying and opening up a large number of free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. Should Double Investment in Artificial Intelligence (AI)
“As China is becoming more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount invested in research in the field,” said Kai Fu Leeu, an AI investor and expert in the field who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment came after various parts of the U.S. government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence in principle.
In the meantime, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to become the first country in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double increases in the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States and we are looking for the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
“Double investment increases could double the chances that the next big achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will come to the United States,” Lee said in a CNBC interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Great Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face<0x2B>.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the best American gamer Othello, and later served as director of Microsoft's research department and chairman of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, the Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would take place to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
“It’s not China that leads academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds of the university to work on researching artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States spur its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that doctoral students in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council announced a Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation.
“The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to individuals in academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations provide funding to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve partners from the activities and the academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an AI Next initiative.
When it comes to the NSF, he currently invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, U.S. legislation that wanted to set up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Saturday about whether they want to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve the dispute with Greece that has been going on for decades and which has blocked Greece from opening negotiations for accession to the European Union.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia, and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents the ownership of its territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on a proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote cast doubt on whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership while accepting an agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying to make Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, accessible to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonia so that we can live freely under the guise of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough MPs said they would respect it to be deemed decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said that no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko agreed to a referendum on changing the country’s name, paving the way for NATO and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set a small stage in front of parliament in Skopje and received chairs in front of tents set by those who boycotted the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads raised, not as servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to welcome us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring as much investment as needed to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said the “positive” result would represent “confirmation of our future.”
A poll released by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will enter the referendum, which is below the required response.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the exit must be 50% plus one vote.
A failed referendum would represent the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since taking office in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes through all of Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday broke Brighton's defense at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, and brought a 2-0 win for Manchester City.
Aguero made the win insanely simple, hitting in the 65th minute.
An Argentine attacker received an addition in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton defenders and then reached the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opposing players in green shirts.
He circumvented one defender, and then beat them a few more on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English striker from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguero, who injected the right-handed digger ball into the right side of the net and defeated Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some foot problems," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We planned to play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
"We're happy that he scored a goal at the time."
But Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues an initial lead in the Premier League crash.
That shot was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's field during that game.
He added a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane along the left side.
Sane pushed the ball several times before directing Sterling to the stand.
The Sky Blues attacker put the ball in the net just before slipping into the car.
Manchester City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to disable Rockies' progression
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to insist on a new start.
But Scherzer always hopes to win against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National West League, come into play.
On Friday night, the Rockies secured a 5:2 win over the Nationals at least in the wild-card game, but they still hope to win their first title.
"While we're playing for nothing, we can at least throw away knowing what the atmosphere is here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would witness this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in that?”
Nationals still have to announce a Sunday starter, but they are allegedly inclined to offer Scherzer to play.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed himself in the thrower room on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The Washington Left scored 18:7 this season, the average winning runs (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of the Republican voters' general election, the president reluctantly commented on his choice of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court judge.
“Everything we have done will be tested in November.
It's still five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
"These are one of the big, big ones - I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that it’s happening right now.
Their intention is to retake power in any way; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to overtake to take power and control; that's why they want power and control. We're not going to give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to “resist and interfere.”
“You’ve seen this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “rage, evil, corrupt, and lying.”
He addressed Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Justice Committee on behalf of the Senate, which caused a loud displeasure to the public.
“Do you remember her response?
Did you leave the document in public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document - it was really a bad body speech, the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer respects different opinions.
Do not tolerate the expression of personal opinions
I wasn't too surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last in a series of Labour MPs who were told they were not welcome – and all because of what we said.
According to my colleague Joan Ryan, they behaved similarly because they strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the censorship proposal for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics that Jeremy Corbyn did not agree with the previous leadership.
On Friday, the Labour branch meeting in Nottingham East stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I worked as a local representative of the Labour Party, the meetings of the main council on Friday night were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today many meetings take place in a different tone, and the promise of a "more polite, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment ever began.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as the associates I thought we shared similar political opinions began demanding from me a drastic change of opinion and a take on attitudes that I would otherwise never agree with – whether it’s about national security or the EU’s national security.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – there is a swarm of insulting words on social networks calling for my revocation, refusing the policies of the centre and telling me that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a wave of sexist or racist comments on a daily basis, but never stop.
One of the aspects of this political era that most disappointed me is the tolerance of offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with every proposal of mistrust or change in the election rules we become increasingly narrower parties.
They've advised me many times over the last two years to shake my head, not to be so loud, and told me that then everything would be okay."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labor Party 32 years ago as a student, motivated by the neglect of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who left my school’s multi-purpose classroom to collapse, I wanted to provide better public services to those in need – whether as a local councilor or a minister in the government.
I've never concealed my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the branch of Nottingham East could have been misled about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would like to say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is taking on Brexit that will negatively affect households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.

Ayr – Melrose: 38: 17 undefeated Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat affected the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the Tennent's Premier League.
Now they've reached the top of the ladder and they're the only invincible of ten teams.
Ultimately, top defense and better use of the opportunity led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"So far we have been tested in every game and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Every honor Ayr, they took advantage of the opportunities better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Frazier Climo led Ayr, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to raise the score, and Jason Baggot did not use it.
Climo increased Ayr's leadership by eleven before, in the meantime, hitting and realizing an independent attempt to change the score for Ayr at 17:5 ahead of the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, who realized Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long break due to Ruaridh Knott's serious injury to the carriers, and when the game continued, Ayr continued the good game with Stafford McDowall's attempt by Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card and Melrose again forced an additional player to pay, an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for breaking the Clima that had no ball; from the line for a penalty kick, MacPherson carried out a posture behind Ayr in full swing of the insider.
Climo realized, as he did almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt of the home team.
Star of the Still Game series seems ready for a new career in restaurant business
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, appears to be ready to continue its service activities after it was revealed that he was appointed CEO of the company's licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favorite series, which is the screenwriter and one of the stars, along with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last to be featured, and Kiernan seems to be planning to devote his life to after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for Scottish Sun said Kiernan wanted to be involved in “the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.”
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no sea exit, hopes that the court will grant it an exit to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling a naval centre full of cranes in La Paz.
In public buildings, the flag of the color of the ocean is reported.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon say: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to bring it back.”
Throughout Bolivia, which has no way out to the sea, the memory of Chile’s lost coastline during the 19th century’s resource conflict is still alive – just like the desire for re-shipping in the Pacific.
While Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice expected on October 1, after a five-year trial, hopes may be at the highest level in recent decades.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is optimistic about the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the judgment of the International Court of Justice on big screens and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the surrender of the sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, a Bolivian charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from Monday's verdict.
“We are back in the Pacific,” he said in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge in favor of Bolivia and that little of that would change if it were.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final hearings, means that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have been backwards.
“The question of access to the sea has been adopted by the current Bolivian leadership,” Zarate said.
Morales' war-torn rhetoric buried every good will of Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the dialogue, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring an “unprecedented opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime issue as a political stick.
"Bolivia will never give up its access to the Pacific," he said.
“The premise is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says it won't have nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his people would never be nuclear disarmament if they could not trust Washington.
Ri addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises during the meeting of the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
The comments were made at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, coming more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the sanctions have continued because of "left fantasies" and that opposition to the U.S. declaration of the end of the Korean War will not throw the North on its knees at all.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete steps to disarmament first.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s serious intention to abandon the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Magazines Reveal That The Last Line Of Big Head Covers Is On The Way To A Luxury Shop In Your Neighborhood
Whether you want to upgrade your hat collection or completely protect the sun, do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the fashion track presented a line of cut-out giant headbands for their spring and summer 2019 collection and thrilled fashion lovers at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats this summer are stifling Instagram, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention on the track.
An outstanding example was invented by Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide perimeter similar to a feather that completely "takes over" the head of the model.
Other massive additives included jewelry-decorated lubricants, magic hats, and even pineapple, but these additives are not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had sewn lips and resembled more Hannibal Lecter than high-fashion pieces.
One of the creations resembled a diving suit with a dishwasher and a mask, and the other looked like a corneal with melted ice cream.
If you follow the big fashion expression – happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge hats could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
Huge hats fit perfectly with the underwear "La Bomba", a straw hat with a circumference of about 60 cm, which is seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the extremely impractical hat that subdued social networks on the fashion track sent another great creation – a straw bag for the beach as big as the model in the swimsuit that wore it.
A sparkling orange rape bag, decorated with rape scissors and a white leather lunch, was an exhibition specimen in the Jacquemus' La Riviera summer collection for 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Stylist of famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big fashion accessories."
John Edward: The Language Skills People Need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding exam results, with an additional emphasis on individual and joint successes in sports, arts, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strives to provide the best level of service to its students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement this school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a preferred and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use English only if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the highest scores in languages were achieved by the graduates of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who learned foreign languages received excellent ratings.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of pupils received an excellent score for Mandarin, while 72% of pupils who learn German, 69% of pupils who learn French and 63% of pupils who learn Spanish also received the highest possible score.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages as elective subjects are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 % of employers could not fill jobs due to a lack of workforce with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative for preparing young people for careers.
With the increasing demand for language skills in the workplace, skills are key in the globalized world.
Regardless of your career choice, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such a long-term skill.
A person who speaks multiple languages can communicate directly with strangers, and this gives them an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey involving more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 % of respondents in the UK do not know a foreign language well enough to communicate on it, and French is the only two-digit percentage of respondents, namely 15 %.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school offers a variety of languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their program, while others will choose languages that are thought to be the most important in the UK in 2020, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, independent schools will always have a diverse choice, as well as teaching staff who are professional in the field.
Scottish independent schools provide children with an environment in which the learners will prepare and arm themselves with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for us.
It cannot be overlooked the fact that in today's global business, knowledge of language is very important for the future of every country, so it must also be reflected in education.
Therefore, knowledge of modern languages should really be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer the choice of language, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Council of Scottish Independent Schools.
LeBron will play the Lakers' suit for the first time on Sunday in San Diego
Fans will soon be waiting for LeBron James' first appearance for the Lakers from Los Angeles.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first pre-season game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes it will take.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is unlikely to play the whole game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his plans for the six-match pre-season in the Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I really don’t need pre-season games,” he said.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a campaign at a number of meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned meetings that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet voted for a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for upcoming elections because there is a risk that Republicans will lose a majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does the Trump summit in West Virginia begin tonight and how do you view it online?
The Trump summit in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours Eastern time, tonight, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's collection in West Virginia can be watched online via live streams on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has sparked controversy over allegations of sexual harassment. The Senate's ruling has been pending for a week before the FBI investigation ends.
But the primary goal of this series of meetings is to help Republicans achieve priority for the November elections.
Trump’s presidential campaign headquarters reported that the five meetings scheduled for next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House.”
"The majority in Congress is so important to the president's plans that he will travel to as many countries as we can as we go into the burning campaign," Trump's anonymous campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The meeting to be held at the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh," West Virginia Metro News reports.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month on Saturday, where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey from West Virginia, who is behind the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must help him improve his ranking in polls,” Simon Haedar, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team left heart on the field ahead of individual raids on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the couple's crusade on Sunday afternoon might be exactly what it was supposed to reverse the Ryder Cup.
"The Wheel of Luck is Turning" is a saying that is especially true in sports and in which athletes believe, and especially in competitions like this.
Who's happy with the bike now?
“They had six points of advantage, and now they have four, so I think luck is on our side right now,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
The Europeans are ahead with four points, while there are 12 points left by the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their backs and encouraged by his match with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after the day.
Spieth played murderous from tea to green and can serve as an example to others.
Fans' clapping became louder when Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, and all culminated in the key path that Spieth reached an unresolved result.
After his 15-hole win, he followed a similar fan url in which he could recognize the hope and belief that Americans could turn everything around.
“You just have to concentrate and think about your game,” Spieth said.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who have won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the sensation of the Ryder Cup.
A European strange but irresistible pair has a maximum number of points and cannot be mistaken.
"Moliwood" is the only couple that has not lost a point on Saturday afternoon, but has avoided both the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinary, show that they are exactly the players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them that can seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun sets over Paris’ Le Golf National.
Maybe they'll both take the win at the same time in different holes.
But it is too early to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Alex Noren and Sergei Garcia, who had a great performance in the couple's game this morning.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes in the playground buried the Spaniard and the Swedish in a hole from which they failed to excavate.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help individuals dig out of their holes.
It is fascinating to watch the games of pairs in close proximity because you can see the interactions of the players in pairs, hear the tips they give and those they don't, as well as study the strategy that can be changed in a moment.
"The Europeans have played better as a team so far, and in the last day they come in with a significant advantage, but this match in pairs has also shown that the U.S. team has the necessary fighting skills, which some, especially the United Stateside, have doubted.
Europeans on the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a lead of 10 : 6
After Saturday's matches in pairs on the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europeans enter with a significant advantage over the US by 10: 6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods have increased by four points at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn in an effort to win the trophy that he won at Hazeltine two years ago was more powerful than the American team in the morning matches, achieving a 3:1 score.
The American team showed greater fighting in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already large.
To win the Jim Furyk team trophy, you need to earn eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood was the first European team debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend only the second couple to win four points in a pair in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball, they proved superior in the game against Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 win.
Woods, who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games, has made some brilliant moves, but now has 19 defeats out of 29 games in fourball and pairs and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to return to the match with partner Henrik Stenson and experience a 2&1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the world's first and third best player.
But the Europeans did not do everything as lubricated during a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday and set the scale high for their American team.
They first defeated Spain's Jonas Rahm and Ian Poulter with a score of 2&1 in fourball, and then defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the entire history of the Ryder Cup, the team that was in the foreseeable four points managed to return in individual games, although the Furyk team only needs an unresolved result to retain the trophy.
After two days in a row, it seems that the Sunday counterattack will be difficult for them to fall.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday in front of the United Nations that further sanctions are increasing distrust in the United States and that there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons in such a way.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea took "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test plant and taking a decision to halt the development of nuclear and weapon technology.
"However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
"If we don't trust the U.S., we don't have faith in our national security, and under such circumstances, there's no way we'll be the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's renowned complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stupid" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would gradually abolish sanctions, his statement was significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current president of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump was safe.
North Korea wants to formally end the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has conditioned Pyongyang before giving up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also ignored calls to reduce strict international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that denuclearization be carried out before that and increases pressure through sanctions to force its goal, and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri added.
“The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is just the mistake of people who don’t know anything about us.
The main problem is that the continued sanctions increase distrust."
Ri didn't mention whether there were plans for the second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the President of the United States spoke about earlier this week at the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had held even three meetings in the last five months, adding: "If denuclearization had been sought by South Korea, not by the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come as soon as possible."
Despite all this, the tone of Minister Riyadh's speech differed greatly from last year's when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and stated that the targeting of continental U.S. missiles was inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim a "man's missile-suicide" missile.
Trump, who threatened last year with "complete destruction" of North Korea this year, praised Kim at the United Nations for his bravery in disarmament, but added that there is still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea implements denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday there was no timeframe for denuclearization, adding: “It doesn’t matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be strictly continued until complete, final and verified denuclearization occurs.”
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic programme.
Pompeo met with Riyadh at the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him after a few hours because of “gangster demands.”
North Korea has agreed to meet with Moon this month to dismantle its missile site and nuclear complex, which will take place if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He added that Kim revealed to him that these "adequate measures" relate to the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard attend a course where they learn how to rest well.
A new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to sleep well in an attempt to fight an increasingly widespread culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
Academics have found that students at the world's best university often have no idea of the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, devised a course he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea of the course after giving a speech about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, “Why did I find out this only now, in my last year of college?”
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the University's chief health officer Paul Barreira said the University decided to start the course after a severe lack of sleep was observed in students during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of the student bedroom on which students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects success, and how important the sleep routine is.
During the lecture, students also learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
After that, a campus map with interactive icons is shown that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride on whole-night pre-examination learning still exists, says the professor, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
The professor says that the student’s secret weapon against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleep also helps in the fight against obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, penetrates it into a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and biology from California, helped Professor Ceisler devise a course after attending his lectures at Harvard's first year.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course across the campus.
As the next step, it plans to ask all graduates to complete a similar study subject before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn on an alarm during sleep, as well as during awakening. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by the displays of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin scored Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after the Dolly Menge hit a missing defense of Steven Gerrard and ended the match with a Livingston victory with a score of 1–0.
The boys from Ibrox wanted to achieve their first win in the roster after a February triumph and a 4–1 result in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his team is now eight points behind in Ladbrokes's Hedbrokes Premier.
Menga achieved the event seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers seemed to be left without inspiration and did not appear to equal the result.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third with only one event of difference behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after linear judge Calum Spence suffered a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight alterations on his hips and thus ran alongside Ayr until the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingston squad that Hearts took last week and would be thrilled that his well-designed squad had suffocated every opponent's attempt.
The Rangers may have had more of the ball in their possession, but Livingston has achieved more with it.
They had the opportunity for the event two minutes after Menga was kicked out of the game for the first time, which opened up space for Scott Pittman to go to the goal of Allan McGregor, however, the tie missed that opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick was cut by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive counterpart Alan Lithgow could only pass the inaccurate kick to the rear rows.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope rather than conviction.
Alfredo Morelos thought that the judge should have given him an stereo 15 minutes after his clash with Steven Lawles, but the judge Steven Thomson did not take into account the Colombian request.
The Rangers managed to score only two balls in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly's one-headed shot of Lassane Coulibaly and Ovie Earia's pitted shot weren't a big deal.
Although Livingston's 34-minute breakdown slowed the game, no one can deny their efforts.
The Rangers again missed taking advantage of Jacobs' deep ball back.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who retained identification and selected Meng for a simple finish of the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly by Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had an instant effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to the exact game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett scored a long shot at each other.
Holt's side could extend the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide-angle run.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again, was late for an 11-year-old because he met Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes.
Almanah: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now there is a page from our Almanach in the Sunday Morning show: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ... the day of the birth of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention later developed a device known as the Geiger meter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has also become the main base of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Colorado, in which the leading roles were apparently played by the incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, “What is this?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger meter, and it’s used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: “Look at that, it sounds so good!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Bad Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Bad Cells and Destroy They
“The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves the extraction of cells of the immune system from the patient and their modification in the laboratory.
The cells are treated to “recognize” the protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected into the patient.
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has been withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting cells of the immune system from the patient, changing them in the laboratory to be able to "recognize" a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers and re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune system cells from the patient and their "learning" how to recognize cancer cells was successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West, on Saturday Night Live, participated in discussions about Trump and supported him, wearing a hat with the headline “Let’s Make America Great Again.”
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a breakthrough performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song at night called Ghost Town, wearing a hat with the cap entitled “Make America Great Again,” he continued to speak against Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people so often and they say to me, ‘If you like Trump, he’s a racist.’
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Justice Committee of the U.S. Senate on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West's speech on social networks was transmitted by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to get West.
West also complained to the public that he was being shoved behind the scenes for the hat he was wearing.
“I’ve been bullied behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
They abused me!
They said I was drowned," the Washington Examiner said.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the bottom?", and he said he was going to wear his Superman coat because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try it with love.”
Variety magazine wrote that his comments had at least twice provoked public displeasure, and members of Saturday Night Live felt embarrassed, while one person for the magazine said: "The whole studio has stopped."
West was invited at the last minute as a replacement for singer Arianna Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West's performance of "I love it", dressed like a bottle of Perrier's mineral water, amazes many.
West was backed by Candace Turner, head of TPUSA’s conservative group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR SUPPOSING MAFIA.”
But TV host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was “simply his own and that it was absolutely wonderful.”
“But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, clothes or supporting his ‘art’) for whom I believe he accepts and extends an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are, too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he will now be “officially known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's footsteps, which is also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion, and of course, the late music legend Prince changed its name to a symbol, then to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Indictment for attempted murder with a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempting to kill a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Criminal Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
Star of the Game of Thrones series Kit Harington focuses on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jonah Snow, who barters the sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor clung to the stereotype of the cat hero, saying that due to such television roles, boys often feel that they have to be strong to gain respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the toxic masculinity problem in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie from the Game of Thrones series, has admitted that he wants to face the problem "very determined".
“Personally, I feel very determined at this moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What did we teach men, as they grew up, about the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television, thanks to the very male characters on the screens, could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What do you learn through TV and on the streets, and that boys feel that they need to have these particular men's lines?
I think that’s actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for the boys.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not film the sequels to the Game of Thrones series after its end next summer and said he had “ending with battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will play in the new performance of the theatrical play True West by Sam Shepard, the story of the filmmaker and his brother theft.
The actor recently discovered that he thought dating his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the filming of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife while filming this series, which gave me a family and a future life,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kitty's character Jonah Snow in an Emmy-winning series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China has said that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases of infection are transmitted by sex, which is a change in relation to the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, the Chinese health authorities said that people infected with HIV in this way are almost absent.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS is increasing by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is said to be a major one.
Research estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman due to conservative values in the country.
Many cases of transmission of the disease in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to address this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of public staff has confiscated information about GOP senators, calling it “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Representative Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal data of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia's website.
A Los Angeles Democratic deputy said the allegations were spread by “ultra-right-wing” individuals, as well as websites.
"Lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The data reportedly contained the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of the data belongs to the Waters office, as well as information about the representative's staff member, The Hill reported.
“These unfounded statements are completely wrong and absolutely false,” Waters said.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and false statements – is in no way responsible for the leakage of this data.
These unsubstantiated statements are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Ms Waters' statement quickly attracted online critics, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He can't be rude.
He's not allowed to review the defendant's motives.
It needs to be calm and calm."
Fleischer seems to be comparing Barbara Walters' reaction to criticism from Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competes against Waters in the general election, also posted on Twitter.
“It’s important if it’s true,” he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her office had notified the “competent authorities and law enforcement authorities” of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she said.
Johnny English: Back on the Task – Insufficiently Interesting Rowan Atkinson Fights a Spy
It is now common in every new British film to ask for messages about Brexit, and it seems that in the new screening of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel called "Johnny English" appeared for the first time in 2003, and in 2011 it returned to "Johnny's big screen".
Will our own satire of how clearly worthless we are become a new national export opportunity?
Johnny English's incompetent eyes and rubber face again has a license to complicate situations, while his name says more than anything that it's a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, a disguised secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of "diluted" glamour, resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a glimpse of Mr. Bean's character and somewhat resembles the guy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" and "Chariots of Fire" of the 2012 london.
His character is also inspired by the traveler and the mysterious world man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard and which is a chaos distillery.
There are one or two great moments in this new movie.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie titles like "007" and "Impossible Missions" offer elements of the comedy themselves.
Humor seems to be intended for children, not adults. In my opinion, the disconnected stories of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as those Atkinson's naive gigs embodied in the character of Mr Bean.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble is now a widely accepted fact.
Hacker has entered the UK's most secretive web of spies and revealed the identities of all British agents, horrified by the agent on duty, who unfortunately appears briefly as Kevin Eldon.
It overwhelms a glass of the Prime Minister's patience, a superior and warrior character who experiences a complete breakdown of the system because he is politically disgusted: Emma Thompson tries to faithfully portray a character who should represent Theresa May, but she doesn't really get the material to do anything with.
Intelligence advisers reveal to her that all active spies are compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person will be careless with Johnny English's head and beard that is currently employed as the director of a subtle school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: here there are a few pretty geeks because English teaches spiing in a rocker style.
Englisha quickly takes her to government premises for an emergency meeting, where she meets again with Bough, her former partner and her eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to over-enthusiastic submarine commander Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely shocked.
And so the two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service, who are doing everything completely wrong, return to action and meet the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bullet, who was incarcerated by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the evil Jason Walt played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey with absurd and funny stories: dressed in waitress inflamed a subtle French restaurant, causing a huge mess of smuggling over the Voltaire luxury yacht, and English provokes complete anarchy by trying to use voluntarism as a virtual listener.
Everything has been done properly for this last sequel, but no matter how attractive and discernible the film still contains a handful of children's elements.
Pretty central achievement.
And as was the case with other Johnny English films, I again wondered if the British film industry could give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to develop a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid in five days.
Labour party Jeremy Corbyn will consider a radical plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid for five-day work.
The party allegedly wants the company’s bosses to pass on to workers the savings achieved by the AI revolution and give them an additional day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say that the idea could be “built” into the party’s economic agenda and plans for the country to favour the interests of the workers.
The Trade Union Congress supports the shift to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
“The four-day working week will not be realized overnight, but it represents a trend that fits the approach that this party has towards balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
The Labour Party, however, does not accept this striving in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party’s policy and the party is not considering it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to develop his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take power out of the hands of “improper executives” and “profiters” in utilities.
The chancellor’s shadow plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to return their overall stake because the Labour government could make “deductions” based on perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on the company's boards of directors and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about “60 Minutes” about whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises questions as to whether the agency's conclusion could affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility that the FBI would uncover something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said going to the trial, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after your statements were made, and he said, "Did you do that?"
He was decisive, unmistakable, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, however, seemed to be glued to the stone.
“I’m determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and I really need a strong charge to change that,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has definitely denied everything," Graham added, thinking about Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the persons she was nominated could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years since that.
I don't see anything changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved something about poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive star list and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for an event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors to the concert had to perform a number of tasks or “works” such as volunteering, sending emails to the world leader, phone calls or any other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their goals.
But how successful has Global Citizen actually been given that he has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to demand a call to action, or just another case of so-called “clickivism” – where people feel that they really change something by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have sought to achieve a number of different goals.
He said the actions were an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to more than <0x24>37 billion in 2030, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 liabilities and announcements arising from its activities, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The Group estimates that the funds insured so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and operators in the UK that is committed to "helping children to develop to their full potential", with the promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the world's citizens, the company will provide a <0x24>35 million sub-aid to the world's targets.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a blunder in history,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a 2018 London-based show.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions undertaken to improve the nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the “The Power of Nutrition” project that will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which reads: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responds: “It will be a long and difficult journey and we will ever fail.
But we will succeed, as did the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.
Performances by Janet Jackson, Weeknda, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the performances at this year's New York event that will lead Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy as a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's involvement in Syria, particularly where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason why Russia in the Middle East is willing to sell energy in the region, as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,” he said.
But in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of sea routes and the blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of the event, hosted by the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which presents itself in the United States as the “voice of energy consumers”.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less exploiting and replacing fuels,” he said, and for Russia he says it is “using the same trick” in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were made at the same time as the Trump administration's intention to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, worth <0x24>11 billion, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to avoid EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the possibility of running for president in 2020, said Massachusetts state senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously consider" the presidential nomination after the mid-term elections.
During an immediate meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about running for a candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that implies a woman at the head,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren expressed an opinion about President Donald Trump during a public meeting, saying he "leads this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a poll published Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters don't think they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent voted for the election.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent of the vote for a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names discussed in connection with the potential 2020 presidential race include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSP Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying in September.
He was arrested and charged with the incident of domestic violence that took place on Monday evening.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, is comparable to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other wounds our soldiers are going back with,” she told an audience at Donald Trump’s meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that was silenced for her son and other war veterans, saying they "returned a little differently, returned hardened, returned wondering whether there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the army, have done for this army."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasila City Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support the review of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties filed a friendly report Friday in Washington to provide support to a politically contested asylum seeker, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" had been abused, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States come, as countries facing gang and domestic violence ubiquitous problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy has changed the Immigration Committee's decision of 2014 to allow immigrants without documents and fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignored decades of state, federal and international law."
“The federal law stipulates that all asylum claims are resolved on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such an impediment violates this principle,” the court’s friend’s report said.
Lawyers further argued that a policy that denies entry of immigrants would harm the U.S. economy, claiming it would be more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
Chief Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on 11 June.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems and even all the serious problems that people face on a daily basis all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was more and more difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma's mother, as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Emergency cars are brought in every minute of the body.
"The government lacks clean water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, browsing through flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were demolished.
Some of the injured, including Dwayne Harris, who suffered a fracture in his back and shoulders, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous heavy subsequent earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking a hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was stuck inside the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Maltreatment' Through 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after official Chinese newspapers published a four-page long ad in the U.S. newspaper that promoted the mutual benefit of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented on Wednesday on a paid addition to the China Daily in the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in U.S. congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections has marked what U.S. officials have characterized in a statement to Reuters as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's revenge at the beginning of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries such as the Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of China, Iowe, the main exporter of agricultural products, said Beijing had damaged U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register newspaper, Branstad states that China "is now doubling this abuse by launching propaganda ads in our own free press."
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and the free press by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"Conversely, at the Beijing street newspaper kiosk you will find limited voices of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people can have about the disturbing Chinese economic path," the press said in a statement.
He added that "some of the most prominent Chinese newspapers have rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers were in question.
Kavanaugh's debacle has pushed voters away before midterm elections, analysts warn
As many Republicans stand alongside Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and defend him on several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming midterm elections, especially among women.
The emotion surrounding the event was very excited, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their vote.
Such things can't come back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell University in Syracuse, told reporters on Saturday.
Reeher expressed suspicion that the last insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it neither tomorrow nor in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters sang: “November is coming!”, protesting in the Senate hall as Republicans controlling the Justice Committee prepared to continue with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news.
“People say they’re already at a high level, which is true.
But they could be higher, especially among women in suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't go to the polls."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court's candidates, analysts suggest that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans continue to confirm.
"This is a real confusion for the Big Old Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about voting in the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve chair, but also about how Republicans got to it and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that assists in the election.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who they will trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more inclined towards him.
A new survey published by YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe in the truth of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh safe or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same for Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Jury last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for Supreme Court judge showed her genitals at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is developing based on Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose a location for storing their data and the people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee found that the intention behind the Inrupt is “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said thinking about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, liabilities lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that it is a decision about who can access what information in its entirety.
The company calls this “personal data empowerment”.
The idea for Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides the resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who have signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, development engineers from all over the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team weren't talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all their business models would turn around overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a media release, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts State Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the awarding of the First World War priests with the Victorian Cross
The celebration in honor of the only priest of the Anglican Church who was awarded the Victorian Cross as a warrior in World War I was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he was given the greatest British military honour.
The monument was discovered by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's act for which he was awarded the award.
According to a report in the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the canal of St. Quentin "through a very dense fog and under a strong fire which came from the direction of a battlefield and machine gunner."
He later fired in the first ranks and led the army forward with "incredible courage" before plunging into the Polish top without anyone's help and hitting three of the military detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s works were “something I know I could never achieve and that inspires humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to be participating in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed awake all night watching Bellator 206, and instead they got the Peppa Pigs.
Imagine this <0xCC><0xB6> you stay awake all night watching a series of Bellator 206 matches to eventually disable tracking of the main event.
The San Jose program featured 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they appeared live at night on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, spectators in the UK were shocked when the broadcast was interrupted.
Many were not impressed at all after they had only been awake until early in the morning because of the fight.
One fan of the interruption of the children's cartoon on Twitter described it as "a sort of sick joke".
“According to state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Juppie, read Peppa."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said he will harmonise his schedules to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I consider reprising, I think we can probably fix something,” Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until Sunday comes with us, when they will already be Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, many transcripts were circulated that weren't even friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it's a problem of state nature.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six what we're doing. We've tried to give more to our fans, but we've exaggerated.
It's an unfortunate circumstance."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Inferior' About Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that until he went to high school, he was not aware that “not everyone is like me.”
In a statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights in order to give “hope” to others.
He also said his victory at the Olympics was less important since he became a father.
The regular director of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a scumbag on Laverne's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" to others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls."
“To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity in relation to others were the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed,” he said.
He says he wanted to prove that he was “someone and something” so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medal has become a prominent person who advocates for LGBT people and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he thought he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to have fallen in love with the man Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar-winning 20-year-old last year, but said his age difference was never a problem.
"When so young you go through so many things," he looked at his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, saying that it was difficult to find someone the same age and that he had experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, the whole story would be about 'I have to win the gold medal'," he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether he had bought tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the first place.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be here long enough to be in the first row,’” he said.
“I held him in my hand while he was breathing out, and it was only after he stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life <0xCC><0xB6> to jump in front of the domestic audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration for choosing the first song <0xCC><0x88> Proud <0xCC><0x88> by singer Heather Small <0xCC><0x88> that she wore in it during the preparations for the Olympic Games and which she always craved .
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to completely return to form in order to avoid an unpleasant turn.
Mickelson, who plays a record twelfth time in this two-year competition, was sent on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and four-square games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day winding up and developing his game at the gym in the hopes of correcting what was bothering him.
Never the most accurate player, not even at the height of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National, where long uneven terrain routinely punishes inaccurate kicks.
And if the pitch isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth game on Sunday, who won all four games this week with the newest Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, come to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man <0xCC><0xB6> more than that and he couldn't say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, he shook my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"There's a lot of self-confidence."
He is famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there were more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Falda's record by the number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup that never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven semi-finals, though Furyk said his presence has also brought certain intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, spirited, he likes to joke with people, and he’s a great guy for that,” he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun with him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving more than a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows a big advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup individual match can easily be turned into an unpleasant race.
Danish debuted in the match at Valderrama in 1997, where the team of Captain Sevea Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a narrow difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 <0xCC><0x8A> 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding us that we had a big advantage at Valderrama; we had a big advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but with a narrow difference," Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching the team with a score of 10 at Golf and winning the score of 3 at National Lecce.
So history will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you will play with full force.
Get out on the field and do everything right.
Nothing is finished until the floors on the plate are advertised.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, and that's what remains the focus.
I talk all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're pretty much aware of who's standing against us, the biggest players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of his players on the heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “In this case, I would never run in front of mine.
Tomorrow we'll have to face a different beast.
Tomorrow's the main individual performances, and that's something completely different.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you’re there as an individual, at the end of the exam are your golfing skills.
This is the message you need to convey to the toys, and it is that tomorrow they have to give the best of themselves.
Now leave your partner because he has to do the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with fellow players, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both ends of these big rounds of the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finishing as a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very start like what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When this advantage starts in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle swords.
"We've organized our team and placed the boys as if we're going to, you know, try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned a task to try to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter faced the other Europeans in the top half.
I have decided that this group of guys is going in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of the selected players for the individual matches.
The German warship was re-established.
The latest frigate of the German navy was due to be launched in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War, but will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and increased costs, local media reported.
The release of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery hit the fate of an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As is known, it will have a powerful ball, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period. It should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to the port of origin.
However, permanent delays mean that the most modern warships, which are said to enable Germany to demonstrate power abroad, will become obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
Last year, an unhappy F125 frigate reached all the frontlines, when the German Navy officially refused to let the ship in service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of key "software and hardware shortcomings" that would render the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software shortcomings were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors <0xCC><0xB6> half less than the older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is dramatically overweight, which reduces its efficiency and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as a class-like ship used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the incorrect hardware, the price of the entire project <0xCC><0xA7> including the training of the crew <0xCC><0xA7> also becomes a problem.
The price is said to have reached astonishing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) <0xCC><0xB6> compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval force is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, acknowledged that the navy is actually “destroying ships capable of deploying.”
The official said that the problem increased over time, because old ships were put out of operation and there were no replacement ships.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
The National Foundation Listens to the Secret Life of a Mice
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how sharks use the landscape in food hunting.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in conducting future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Scottish Foundation (NTS) will follow common and watery duck mice, as well as brown elongated and river mice in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track the activities of the mice throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile inspections using manual detectors.
A professional analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the mouse voting and what kind it does.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for mice and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of work on habitat management, such as the creation of beetles and how best to maintain forest areas for mice and other related species.
Mice populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and decorative works that affect shelters and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be hazardous, as well as molluscs and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of pet cats.
Mice aren't actually blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to find bubbles and obstacles along the way of their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the shrimp very seriously.
He has ten trained professionals, who regularly conduct research, shelter inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has even set up the first and only mouse reserve in Scotland on the Threa property in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of mouse live in Scotland.
Manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal area for them.
"There's a lot of room for mice here in Threave," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good housing.
However, there's a lot more we don't know about mice, so the work we do here and on other sites will help us better understand what they need to make progress."
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of mice before the construction work begins inside the building, as the accidental destruction of a single bed can kill up to 400 women and young people, thereby likely destroying the entire local population.
Mice are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Scottish Mice Association, urged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our mice and for many of our species we simply don’t know how their population is progressing.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape allegations against him as “fake news,” saying people “wanted to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers will be prosecuted by the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been charged with raping Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her <0x24>375,000 to shut up about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after filing the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo criticized the allegations as "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” says the five-time Golden Ball winner in the camera.
“They want to be promoted using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to pronounce my name, but it's part of the business.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the footballer added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they called “unacceptable reporting on privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said he would seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the soccer player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who was disappointed by that "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was agreed.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and was photographed injured in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial deal because she was “fearful of revenge” and worried that she would be “publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the deal because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve as part of a crossing worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK "will forever regret" the loss of car manufacturers
The UK will "forever regret" if after Brexit it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of waiting at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston <0xCC><0xB6> engine produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis <0xCC><0xB6> last year produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement by the end of March, we will experience production stalls at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement due to possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The car manufacturer's main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates according to the “right on time” principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there could be a break at the border that industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota in its Derbyshire plant could not keep more stock than it needed for a day, the company said, and production would be halted.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan offered by Theresa May for future EU relations was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We need to agree. We want to reach the best possible deal that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 today.
“The evidence not only shows Toyota, but also other manufacturers that we absolutely need to be able to continue this very successful supply chain.”
In Toyota, they could not say how long production could be stopped, but they warned that in the long run, the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite trade union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, after your jobs are gone, you never come back again."
A government spokesman said: "We have developed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House says
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed by another week" as the fight for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Attorney Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference in the election, ties between Trump's colleagues and Russia, and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy prosecutor's office, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been shattering the bars in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been discussing wiring to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein declined these statements.
But he went to the White House on Monday amid an announcement that he would just resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid overlap with a hearing by the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh testified and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's lawsuits, which further delayed much of the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not fixed, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week taking into account all the rest of what is happening to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to inform the press about everything."
Some journalists would argue that Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Director Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of a press conference was not a consequence of the reluctance to "theatrical behavior" of television reporters, although she said: "I will not contradict the facts to be interfering."
She then announced that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president organizes more meetings to answer questions than any president before him,” she said, adding, “we have analyzed the numbers.”
Short talks will continue, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to ask a question directly to the President of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to make this possible often, and you could have seen it in the last few weeks, and just that you can talk to the President of the United States will replace short talks with the journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with inviting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York City, the president may have shown why, free and sometimes bizarre performances in front of the gathered journalists.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The health minister sent a letter to EU staff staff at the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to cover the costs of applying for a residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations have continued between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal, which are moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepping up its preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would now like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare services and help the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line-up player Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a Saturday's Vanderbilt Commodores defeat with a score of 31–27, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-hour.
“He came to the line of the playground and just crashed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting it on the carrier and sending it for further searches.
A spokesman for Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been discharged from surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was no “details about the type/range of injury” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with a two-year toy internship, plays the first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five shots before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 shots in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the UK
According to new conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Riznica expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the UK and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The increase will be charged to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will contribute to the government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee charged to the current fee, including the increase introduced two years ago to other houses and the property purchased for issuance may be up to 3%.
The company expects that this move will raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's newly built properties are bought by residents who do not have a residence in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the company of those who own their own home.
Many rich areas of the country <0xCC><0xB6> especially in the capital <0xCC><0xB6> have become "spirit cities" due to the large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a fee cut to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not exploiting the land, and urged Mrs May to give up the quota on affordable real estate to fix the "shame due to the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced the proposal for a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of nothing-induced deployments.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I will dedicate my mandate to the renewal of the British dream that every new generation’s life should be better.
And this implies repairing our collapsed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it may not be correct that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes easily as well as valuable British.
The dream of owning a home has gone far too far for a large number of people, and the shame of homelessness is still quite real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland"
Sunderland's boss Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is one day to become Scotland's manager.
Scotland (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently occupies third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Lights Stadium after he again led St. Mirren in the Scottish football championship last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and that always drew me back.
But this opportunity could only be realized if I was successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cania.
Former Alloa Athletica boss says he didn't feel scared because he inherits such famous names in such a big club, after he previously declined calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured by whether I will be able to bring this club back to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and content, this club is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I probably would only consider myself successful if I could get the club back there."
Ross only completed his third year of managerial career, after a period during which he was an assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from falling in the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of falling to the championship winners of the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academica.
"It was probably a real crossroads," Alloa recalled.
“I really believed that managing is more of what suits me than playing.
It sounds unusual because I was doing well, earning well, and enjoying rather successful moments.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through this in terms of stress and work pressure, but management seems like the right thing.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

The summer heatwave increased revenues to British pubs struggling with finances, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars achieved a 2.7 per cent increase in revenue in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the Office of the Chief Auditor of Business Books, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the good weather and England’s participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July would be similar to the previous year’s.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly served have made much higher profits on equal terms compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mostly served also suffered from heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed breweries and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent over the month, and food sales declined by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s analyst for leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the foreign market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with difficulties, although a fall in sales of 4.8 percent annually will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the managers of the food venues, and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the most necessary breakthrough."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the growth of brand shares.

One in five children has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents.
One in five children, some only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of “false Insta” pages
The news has heightened the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that shows their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts referring to a photo-sharing website.
The news has heightened the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they use a cleaned “main” account to show their parents, while at the same time they have private accounts.
A mother who found a secret website for her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage girl who encouraged her to use other words, “violence me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC), found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of which admit to owning private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s awkward that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director of the annual board of directors.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who run sports to take advantage of her extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from being a member of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200-400m race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, out of his four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC expert, was unable to walk after a transient Ishemian attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show if I will recover and to what extent.
It was strenuous, but completely recovered, learning to walk again today to exercise agility!
Thank you for your encouragement messages!"
Shared opinions on the internet about advertising for a traitor comparing mothers with cows
A publisher company with its own advertising that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows that have been raised by their mothers has shared opinions on the internet.
To mark the launch of the product, which is said to be “the first silent wearer in the world,” Elvie’s consumer technology company has released an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to showcase the freedom that the new publisher gives mothers.
Four mothers dance in a stall filled with silk and cows with music, the text of which reads, "Yes, I marry myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't me, it's my breasts."
Then the refrain follows: "Pump, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, your lady's husband."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, provoked controversy on the internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed spectator reactions, and many say it illuminates the "horrific" dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are stolen a few days after birth,” one person wrote.
The Elvie traitor discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
The other person comments: “It is understandably traumatic for the mother and the child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise traitors to mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added, “Completely unauthorized advertising.”
The others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that her song was "smiling".
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
Dairy delivery made me feel just like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I figured it out as it is.
“This is a great product,” she said.
Another commented: “This is an entertaining advertisement aimed at mothers who produce milk (often in their workplaces or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet traitors lying in the bra.
The campaign concept is based on the knowledge that many dairy-producing women say they feel like cows.
The traitor Elvie, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and is discreetly fit into the breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even come out during the traitorship.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: “Elvie’s traitor is so revolutionary that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between showing women and cows, we wanted to focus on betrayal and all its challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's traitor has made her headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrants Silently Moved to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid to jeopardize their chances of staying in the country by entering and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before the congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees were not previously recorded in the criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor’s household in the country are illegal, and most of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to search for these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
According to the statements of the shelter worker, in order to accelerate the implementation of the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of closing, rather than 60 days, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via a videoconferencing call, rather than in person, in order to bring their case before an immigration court to obtain legal status.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to the statements of the shelter worker and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outcomes or attempts to escape.
Proponents said these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, because of its size, it is very likely that signs that the child will be tormented will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent town without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the auspices of fighting terrorism, and that they would "be treated accordingly".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, while millions have been homeless.
He said Damascus would continue “the fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared” of terrorist groups and “any illegal presence of foreigners”.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees not to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a mass attack by Syrian forces with Russia’s support on a region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear timings” and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including Nusra-linked fighters on the al-Qaeda front, “who will be eradicated.”
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee of members of the government and opposition in order to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying the work of the committee should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why will Trump win second term?
According to that logic, Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers likely hope, the revocation and scandal end his presidency too early.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!”
There are currently no signs of spectator's fatigue.
Since 2014, viewing in the strike term has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the strike deadline, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" show surpassed viewers with as much as 3.5 million viewers at mainstream news shows.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor” drama, about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of the comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, "Because you're smiling at me," said Mrs. Scovell.
There is a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the abortion law proscribed from Roe’s case against Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Excluding is a luxury that can only be afforded by the most privileged viewers.
Yet you’re exceeding the level of an informed citizen when you realize that for six hours you’ve been watching a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used “deep background” sources for his book “Fear”, the cover of this Paul Manafort jacket, and the description of this, too skin-skinned, 15,000-year-old Daniel Storpod.
I, for example, will never look at Super Maria again with the same eyes.
"Part of what makes you experience it as a reality show is that something feeds you every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "Zalagaonica", about the rotating actress set and the daily complications of Trump's show.
You can't afford to miss any episode because you're going to be late.
When I got to Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his house on the north coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny at a temperature of 80 degrees Celsius (approximately 27 degrees Celsius), but he was inside watching MSNBC and at the same time filming CNN.
He could not separate himself from the TV, not until Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hanged on the end.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

The money from the outside goes to the most uncertain mid-term election race for Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the restructuring of congressional districts which resulted in two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently refurbished district of the suburban part of Pittsburgh is highlighted by Democrat Conor Lamb <0xCC><0xB6>, who won a place in a second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were re-drawn after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January ruled that the old districts were permanently restricted in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a fight to fund the campaign between the main party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraising Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a widely followed special March election for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
This position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the county with a 20-point lead.
Political analysts have given Democrats a minor advantage.
The U.S. decides whether to punish El Salvador for providing support to China, and then withdraws
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to call on U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high rates of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering last year, which was seen as a progress in efforts to prevent the movement of migrants.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, effectively discontinuing any consideration of the punishment for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
The History
The next draft could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now very significant evidence available to the public.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, also directed his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of its attack on our elections.
If the majority in Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to stand before voters again, and perhaps ultimately with the jury at his level.
There are many of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trum's fall is inevitable - not even those like him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, only that the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
History revolves around such moments of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are now facing some of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since these newspapers reported that he secretly proposed the president's recording last year and speculated about his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“How are we going to respond if the FBI’s recently commissioned investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it has been confirmed to the Supreme Court despite convincing allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?”
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress that will call on Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fall on these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we're not going to fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once served at my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on that table with a crooked cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic about confronting Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers on Thursday hosted Rapid from Vienna, knowing that their victory over the Austrians, after an impressive rally in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season to a 2<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> 2 rally with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a kick-off board for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and we scored a point.
We may have been able to eventually steal the game, but, generally speaking, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is yet another big European night.
Hopefully we can win three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a good score in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
"Last year was definitely a tough one, between everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling.
The boys are good and the boys really enjoy; the training is good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the respondents in the Nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking steps to start a conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing can include traditional long-term care insurance, a value-for-money hybrid life insurance policy that will help you cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have the money.
Manage your legal documents: At the root, prevent legal battles.
Hire healthcare professionals to identify a reliable person who will supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider empowering you to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure you pay your bills if you are not able to.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your aged parent is in a situation that requires emergency medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify the details in the written plan to be ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s also about who the doctors are,” Martin asked.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
"Keep that plan at hand."
Man shot several times by air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times with aerial shots while returning home after the night's departure.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in her chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 p.m. BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to increase.
As communications were interrupted, aid officials were unable to obtain any information from Donggale province, an area north of Palu near the 7.5-degree epicenter of the quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a district that extends over more than 300 km of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also struck western Dongguan in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Circle of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, sparked a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A plethora of earthquakes hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the building's collapse.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with reports of domestic violence and refusing arrest, a report released Saturday by an Alaskan state police officer said.
According to a police report, when a celebrity tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Palin is detained in Mat-Su and is held on an uninsured bond of <0x24>500, KTU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "innocent, of course", the network reported.
Palina is charged for three Class A offences, which means he could be in prison for up to a year and be fined a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B crime, which is punishable by one day of imprisonment and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with reports of domestic violence, and possession of alcoholic weapons associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck Indonesia's island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been discontinued, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the immediate vicinity of central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of the blow.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfulla Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck at Home Depot to carry out an attack on a cycling trail along the West Side Road in Lower Manhattan, where he hit pedestrians and cyclists found on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip 'intentionally' killed eight victims and 'intentionally' committed a serious bodily injury, according to the announcement of his intention to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury struck a 22-point indictment, which included eight murder and torture charges, which federal prosecutors typically use in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “significant planning and premeditation,” the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov conducted it as “humiliating, cruel and corrupt.”
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernana Ferruchija, Hernana Diego Mendoza, and Alejandra Pagm<0xC4><0x99>rena."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's southern district last prosecuted the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a federal case in New York City in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy for espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 on an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbekistan-born man, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he was feeling good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching an ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment said.
He also requested to report the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He said he was not guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting the conviction for life in prison without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has pledged to "mobilize the People's Army" during a protest at a Conservative conference.
The former head of the UK's Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of the Euroskeptic as one of the members of parliament, Therese May, suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative deputy Peter Bone has said in a press conference in Birmingham that the United Kingdom has so far "exited" that Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs. May has faced in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is highlighted by the Tory people inclined to join a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain her Chequers compromise plan amid an attack on Brexit supporters, the remaining EU supporters.
The Allies insisted that it would continue its attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone said at the “Leave Means Leave” campaign meeting in Solihlu that he wants to “reject the Chequers”.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have a title and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he were the boss, we'd be out by now," he said.
A Wellingborough MP added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we have to throw out the Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the allegation that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely inaccurate.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative and Brexit supporter, was also in a hurry, addressing reporters with the words: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Plan Chequers is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually those who went out to the streets and elected us.
Please dismiss the Chequers and start listening."
In a statement, Ms May added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the assembly that politicians should be forced to "feel pressure" if they are preparing to disappoint the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s now a matter of trust between us and our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to deliver Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'it's not going to happen to you.'
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of delivering Brexit, to feel pressure.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the settlers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A large number of activists were harassed by “Tories vs. Brexit” posters after the group launched this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis has been arguing with conservatives over the security issues they faced with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"It's people who tell us they can have IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus plan, for a smooth border state, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s all a farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Seriously Consider’ Candidate for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “think seriously about running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a direct conversation with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was the vice president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It has been at the center of speculation for some time to counter Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th public meeting since Trump took office.
He asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that implies a woman at the head."
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, said on Saturday that they arrested the suspect in the shooting with the death of Louisiana State University basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information on the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20) at 11 a.m. at an ET press conference.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, seeking help in identifying the man from the video.
Sims, 20, was killed early Friday near the University of Southern campus.
"Wayde Sims got a bullet wound in his head and eventually died as a result of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the crime scene and possessing guns and killing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a 3rd-year high 198 cm student who grew up at Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the top 10 last season and averaged 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 leaps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Champion title after his order secures victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team's order would "play a big role in the race."
From an initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went to boxing and left Hamilton to get into traffic at the start, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered boxing one lap later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action wheel on wheel that caused the Ferrari driver to unwittingly leave a free interior in danger of retreating after a double move in defense of the third curve.
Max Verstappen went from the last row and was seventh to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race while relying on his tyres to reach a fast finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally reached boxing in the 44th round, but failed to accelerate his pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtteri had been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has done a really great job to achieve the formation finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a summit on Saturday for her insistence that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate proved that people were "bad and ugly and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil, ugly and dishonest," he said.
“When you look at the publications and leaks of information to the public and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leave the information?
Remember her answer...have you left the document in public – ‘aaa, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let ... No, we didn’t,” he added imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it ran out earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t make her story public,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep her a secret, and I kept her a secret, which she wanted.”
However, her denial did not come to the approval of the president, who commented at a meeting on Saturday night: "Let me tell you something - it was a very bad body speech.
"Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body speech in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to restore power at all costs.
"You see evil, cowardice, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they have to beat to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 <0xCC><0x8A> 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars were compensated for defeating Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a 5–3 win in Dundee on Saturday.
In the early minutes, the Giants took advantage of two goals with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home to equality, and then Dwyer brought Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured a win.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for the team of Adam Keefe, who came from the background and defeated Dundee with a 2–1 result in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, and the Giants won in the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening match came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 p.m., assisted by Kendall McFaul, assisted by David Rutherford to double the lead by defeating Beauvillier four minutes later.
In the rushing opening of the game, Sullivan returned home team to the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt made Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with the lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The domestics regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to equilibrium in the force measurements at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen lead Dundee at the end of the second third, and he made sure to win when his team was already halfway through to winning the last third of the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, are the hosts of the Milton Keynes team in the next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers on Airplane Escape Earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero after he died while ensuring the safe flight of aircraft with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed, and many are believed to have disappeared after a major earthquake that struck Sulawesi on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport control tower.
He remained to ensure the safe flight of the Batik Air aircraft on Flight 6321, which was then on the track.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“Our heart is broken because of this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggang, Sigis and Boutonga is limited.
"The number of deaths is believed to continue to increase, as many bodies are still in ruins and many could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircrafts bring assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “She carries ambulances every minute of body imports.
The government lacks clean water.
There are small shops everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing after survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini now says a man is being treated as missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which owns an aircraft that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one man is being treated as missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the aircraft that was on board.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon they could not track any of the passengers.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the person concerned.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane crashed while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
What caused the decline and exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the aircraft had landed in a lagoon near the track.
Some patriots thought the plane missed the track.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from the United States, said the aircraft flew very low.
“That’s very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others had managed to break through the water that had flown to their waist until they got out in the event of an airplane crash that had drowned.
He said the waitress was panicking and screaming, and that he suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked near the harbor repairs also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the aircraft sank to about 30 meters of water.
Air Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered air carrier accidents in the past two decades, but none of them have been involved in Air Niugini.
Analyst reveals a timeline of the night when a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor's office on Saturday concluded a case in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to plot a plot about the move of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said the location data came from several phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reports.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to inspect Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "shocked, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The data from the cell phone indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, some time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls, and contact details from her phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Aware Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to provoke a negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
"The High Breed" from Bristol claims that hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as Fugees and Commons are born again in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
"Another black woman?"
New York midwife sues couple for resignation after "racist" message
A New York midwife is suing a couple for discriminatory resignation after receiving a misdirected message from her mother calling her “one more black woman.”
The couple denies that they are racists, comparing the accusation with “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dissatisfaction when she learned after her first working day in 2016 that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
“NEEE AGAIN CRNKINJA,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her wife.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she was sent twice by Mrs. Maurice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an "inconvenient" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their then-ex-girlfriend, who was an African-American, was doing her job poorly, and that she was in New York, instead of Philip.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day of work, and then she went home.
Maurice now sues the couple for a cancellation fee and seeks compensation of <0x24>350 a day for a six-month period for which she was originally engaged, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that I can’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple retorted to allegations that they were racists, saying it was reasonable to do the end of Maurice's employment, fearing that she would not be believed due to insults afterwards.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent her a message.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you trust your children to the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Oh, come on.
Plasco said his wife had only two months of maternity leave after the birth of the child and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“You’re going to sue someone who’s in a situation like this.
“That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
Although court proceedings are still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time before publication.
It's a lot of fun what we know now about Paddington's huge success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC filmmaker before the little teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, would be optimistic if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was filled with happiness and sadness after his death.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was silently proud of his final success.
“He was a pretty good guy and he wasn’t a complimentary guy,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, everything was seen as a accomplishment of his own child: you are proud of him, even though none of that is actually your work.
I think Paddington's success was observed in this way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed merit exclusively to Paddington."
My daughter died and we had to say goodbye by phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“He called on a regular basis to say that it was really bad and that they believed he was not going to get out,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad invited me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
What I did.
I said, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep the heart working slowly lost its effect and left her body system.
She died shortly before boarding, and then it all turned out.
I just had to sit down and wait and know what was going to happen.
I couldn’t scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it all in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already saddened by the loss of her daughter at the time, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the trials she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I lowered my head, and tears fell down my face all the time.
It was hard to explain, but in the summer I felt a strong feeling of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Messages from women on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who are left without loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs Davis, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a cook with a contagious smile awaiting her brilliant career.
“Everyone remembers him with his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
However, before his death, he left the job because he was “in a really dark state.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that this will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea with the cards “so that people would know that there is someone you can go and talk to, even if she is a friend.
Don't sit quietly, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner she had been with for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at the very bottom of Christmas when the children opened the gifts, he didn’t look them in the eyes or want anything else.”
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but that they had to overcome it: “All this leaves a big hole in the family.
Take us out.
But we will continue to fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is over as the FBI investigates
“I thought we might be able to bring in a bit of unity if we really managed to get something like what he was looking for in a timely and limited investigation,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would “grow up” in the midst of a rooted blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance was driven by the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections are coming in just five weeks, on November 6th, as the Republicans are expected to not go well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to lead the wanted man to the election of the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush constantly calls on senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its own report?
It will be voted in the Senate, which currently houses 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break with a decisive vote and confirm his seat in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of refugees 'descends' under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Referring to data from the United Southern Alliance's ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1127 escapes last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors are stricter controls on the border crossing between North Korea and China and more taxes on human traffickers.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The vast majority of the refugees from the North eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them violently.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in talks that focused on suspended denuclearization negotiations.
This followed a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work to free the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of not making any progress since then.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and it is not considered that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm ourselves,” Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said she was unable to serve in the Supreme Court due to her temperament.
Pelosi commented in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't have imagined that a woman, if she ever behaved like this, would have been called 'hysterical'," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denounced claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During the introductory statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, from time to time almost screaming and suffocating while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him a "gross and coordinated blackmail" organized by the angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the work of the Supreme Court, because he showed that he had prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked whether he would try to revoke Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if Democrats get a majority in the House, Pelosi resigned.
“I’ll say the following if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not able not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Accessibility Care Act or the Abortion Act arising out of Roe's proceedings against Wade, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh circumvented questions as to whether he would revise any Supreme Court rulings.
“It’s not time for a hysterical, impartial person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’”
Women have to deal with it.
Justified criticism, the anger that has accumulated for months and years <0xCC><0xB6> of all this cannot be rid of without a salary.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinen told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual. What do you think?"
She continued: “A woman who once was the executive director and who said she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique that, when she was angry and she started crying, the person she was talking to says, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was excellent."
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of the first jobs, in an office dominated by men, is that once when I was crying because of inexpressible anger, an older woman <0xCC><0xB6> a cold manager I was always a little afraid <0xCC><0xB6> pulled me down to the staircase.
“Never let them see you crying,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they'll think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on the Monkey Business ship and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason she would not consider the idea of running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-designed decision,” she told me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn’t need another one.
Somebody called them "The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already been postponed, she was behind the fundraising, and vowed not to enter the race if she did not raise <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave <0x24>1,000 to men, gave her only <0x24>250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” she asked.
While she said she wasn't going to start a formal campaign, she was so obsessed with emotion and gratitude towards the people who supported her, frustration about the system that made it harder to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism that she felt like she was hurt.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled the reaction of the media to her.
“You would think that Cleenex is my corporate sponsor.”
I remember thinking about what it would put on my top-to-top monument.
“She cried.”
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The beginning of the trade war between the United States and China has been sharply echoed and, while the battle is far from over, the split between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in products, actually taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Every time, Beijing has reversed in some way, and recently imposed a tariff of five to ten percent on <0x24>60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to respond to the U.S. strike by strike, and the world's second-largest economy will certainly not surrender soon.
Washington’s withdrawal could be achieved by waiving demands, but public submission to the United States would be too unpleasant for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could in the long run provide positive support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic shock in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a non-strategic think-tank scientific associate at the Center for Strategic Thinking, who focuses on a
Syria is ‘ready’ to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for aid in the reconstruction of a country that has been devastated by a seven-year war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing with the rehabilitation of areas destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily lives and existence have been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be well assisted in the restoration of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept either the conditional assistance or the assistance of the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 <0xCC><0xB6> 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the crown, while the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who tortured almost the entire tournament, on 16 holes pair 3, sent the ball into the water at the first blow, leaving the match to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of the 4 players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament started this format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth kicked Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest-ranked player of the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most victory in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop crying today.
The year was hard.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that I won the cup again.
It's all up to the team. I'm happy that I could help," said Garcia, full of emotion after the European victory.
He passes the flame to his compatriot John Ram, who won the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods in individual games on Sunday with a score of 2&1.
“I feel an incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 main titles, and is right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find a way out over the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, US Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At some point in time, we have resisted Europe.
We didn't do it.
I'm dropping Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to fight, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, so we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take the people's hat off.
We're uplifted."
