Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they "look like dolls"
Some members of the Assembly voted on a proposal to change their name to MWP (little member of the Welsh Parliament).
This relates to the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that at the political level this could cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Assembly said his group was concerned that "it was going to run with Twp and Pwp".
Not for Welsh readers: The language “twp” means “white” and “pwp” means “what”.
A member of the Plaid assembly said the entire group was "dissatisfied" and offered alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" for the name change, but noted that it was a shortening of the word from MWP to "doll".
Mat Wave letter w is pronounced in the same way as Yorkshire's English is pronounced in the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the draft legislation to change the name, said: “The final decision on the names of all the members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter of the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on proposals that received strong support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Commission gave priority to the members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but MWP received the highest support during public consultations.
Members of the House clearly offer alternatives, but efforts to reach an agreement could become headaches for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit legislative proposals on amendments within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms shall include other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including rules on disqualification of the Member of the Assembly and the system plan of the Committee.
During the debate on legislation, the members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on how they should be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum on country name change
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A global vote was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means claims to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
Opposing the plebiscite on the name change, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov said that the vote would be neglected.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is simply a price that just needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
During Harlem's hardships, St. Martin's and other churches fell asleep.
“The old people I’ve talked to said that historically there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
“You haven’t found one or the other today.”
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
“People are communicating differently these days,” he said.
“The bars are no longer a neighborhood site where people gather all the time.”
Speaking of the churches, he is concerned that the money he received after the sale of the property will not be long enough, as the leaders expected, “and sooner or later they will return to where they began.”
He added that churches could be replaced by multi-bedrooms with cooperative apartments, in which people will live, who will not help next to the surviving temples.
“Most of the people who buy cooperative apartments in these multi-bedrooms will be white,” he said, “and will therefore be appalled at the moment when the churches are completely closed, because most of these people who have moved to these cooperative apartments are unlikely to become black people.”
Both churches were built by white congregations in 1870, before Harlem became a black metropolis – a metropolis community, and St. Martin’s church was built a decade later.
The first White Methodist Congregation emerged in the twentieth century.
The Black Congregation, in the vicinity of the church, took over the name of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation with clergyman John Howard Johnson, who led a retailer boycott on 125th Street, Harlem's main store, where blacks were refused to hire or be assigned to higher offices.
The building was devastated by a fire in 1939, but because the parishioners of spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's Church, proudly called the charillion the poor penis.
Experts who blocked the July carillion called it differently “the cultural lobby” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the first carillon in the world played by black musician Dionysius A. Linda. 18 years ago he started playing a larger carillon at the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said St. Martin's Church did not change him to another musician.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin’s church has been a complex history related to architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by church seculars, others by the Bishopric of the Episcopal Church.
Zacchaeus, a parish governing body made up of secular leaders, expressed concern to the bishops in July that the bishops would “try to pass on expenses” to the Baptism, although it did not employ architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners have complained that the bishopric is lacking in transparency.
Warrior Injures 13-Year-Old Injured In California
Officials said the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he was caught in California on the opening day of the omer season.
He was attacked at 7 a.m. in Ensinitas near the beach of Lighthouse.
Chad Hammel San Diego’s KSWB-TV channels said he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then came back with the group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was excited about catching a worm, but then realized that the boy was screaming, “I’m kissing!
I'm kissing!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that all of his keys had been stolen.
“I started screaming at everyone to jump out of the water: ‘A shark floats in the water!’”
The boy was dispatched by plane to San Diego's Rady Children's Hospital, where he was admitted to being in critical condition.
What kind of shark was attacked by a boy is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper hip.
Officials closed the beach from Casablanca Ponto to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours for investigation and protection.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the beauty sections of the universal style stores, where specialist consultants will work.
Actively pushing <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion into the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow, with sales of fashion and household goods falling, the larger beauty goods departments will be tested in 11 more stores across the country and, if they are ready for the next year, they will be ready for the next year.
Investments in beauty are growing, and shopping malls are looking for ways to use shelves, once designed for TVs, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's has announced that it will double its beauty range to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will also receive more local brands in areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The shopping mall is also releasing its Boutique range of makeup, most of which are vegan, which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will try discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open later this year in Seli Ouke, Birmingham.
Due to online shopping and the desire to buy small quantities on a daily basis from local essential goods stores, shopping malls have to make more efforts to attract people to visit there.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said that corporate retailers are increasingly looking like universal stores as shopping mall networks are trying to combat selling merchandise cheaper than Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has added Argos outlets to hundreds of stores and has also installed a number of Habitat stores, because two years ago it bought both networks, which are said to have boosted the sale of food products and their acquisition was a must.
A previous attempt by the mall to update its beauty and pharmacy department ended unsuccessfully.
At the beginning of the 1st century Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended up arguing about how to distribute the proceeds from pharmacy stores in shopping malls.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy store for <0xC2><0xA3>125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, three years ago.
It was claimed that Lloyds’ contribution to this plan added an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the exterior and atmosphere of the beauty department to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be willing to give advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need, and thanks to its attractive environment and convenient places, we are now an attractive place of beauty, challenging the old way of purchasing."
Peter Jones is "satisfied" with Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with him
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones has been "conquered" after television host Holly Willoughby broke off a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
H. Willoughby no longer has time for their home sales and accessories brand "Truly".
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand.
The 37-year-old cablemaker, This Morning, said on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby, who left a lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, blurred Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say Jones was "satisfied" when a golden television girl in his business empire's Marlou (Bakinghamshire) capital at a press conference on Tuesday acknowledged that new deals worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million would no longer be used for him.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's trademark Goop, and was expected to double H. Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby reported on her Instagram account leaving "Truly", Jones left the UK for one of her summer residences.
The source said: “Truly has been one of Holly’s most important priorities so far.
It should have been her long-term future, lasting for the next couple of decades.
Her decision to leave was surprising to all of us.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
There's a full warehouse in Marlou's headquarters ready to sell."
Experts believe that leaving The Morning, one of the most financially successful stars in the UK, could cost the company millions for large investments in products, starting with pillows and candles and ending with clothes, towels, towels, towels, and towels.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, H. Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have maintained close ties with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for decades.
In 2016, Willoughby and T. Capp founded Truly, and 52-year-old Jones joined the fight as president.
The couple are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and will replace ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" director, Ant McPartlin.
A source close to Jones said yesterday: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
We talked hard and “we fell in love.”
He was joking about criticism from the media over the comments made, which some might consider "non-presidents" as well as the fact that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
In a brief voice, the "newsman" said:
“I didn’t deny anything.”
He pointed out that Kim is interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was supported as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are strigo.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not getting an “essential response” from the United States.
He noted that instead, the United States is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his speech, he expressed a much more optimistic attitude.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
We wanted to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We are now in a good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of the missile tests, the relief of the hostages and the return of American troops to their homes.
He defended his unusual attitude by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people wanting to enter this crowded arena, we’d better have about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing out to the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesia's quake and earthquake devastated the island, killing hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were notified that their assistance was not needed.
While more than 10 per cent of Lombok’s population was deployed, it was not declared a national disaster – a necessary condition for providing international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it has been very clear that there is no need for international assistance, so it’s a bit complicated,” Sumbung said.
While “Saving Children” is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether workers working abroad will be able to work on the spot.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to find out if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given Indonesia’s ongoing earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the natural rage.
Although the tsunami barriers were built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
As a result of the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens, Paul, despite the warning, is likely to have increased lives.
The best time to travel between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
As a result of natural disasters, logistics becomes even more complex.
A hospital ship deployed in Lombok, where the victims of the earthquake are treated, will sail to Palu, but it will reach the site of a new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has chosen the centre of his election campaign for the reconstruction of Indonesian infrastructure and has generously spent money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not bring peace to Joko’s administration, as he will be in the elections again next year.
Noko is also under pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adhere to a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been evicted from their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets using masks, arrows and other simple weapons.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge sets a distant leveling goal in Chelsea's matches
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing Chelsea Premier League matches in the 89th minute, smashing at the Stanford Bridge Stadium in London on Saturday.
With a 1-0 draw, Xherdan Shaqiri handed the ball about 30 metres from the Chelsea goalkeeper Sturridge.
He threw the ball on his left leg and hit the far corner.
The ball raised high above the penalty area flew to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, he crossed over the Arrizabalaga of Kepa and reached the net.
“I was just trying to get the ball, and players like Shaqs are always playing as far ahead as I can, so I was just trying to stay as long as possible for a shot,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante running away, I hit the ball with one touch, and without thinking too much, I just hit it.”
After Belgian star Eden Hazard scored 25 minutes for Chelsea from the first lift, he scored 1-0.
During the attack, the Blues attacker in the middle of the square gave the ball back to Mateo Kovacicici and rushed to Liverpool side.
In the middle of the square quickly broke the wall.
The goalkeepers then sent the ball between the opponents to the penalty area to invade Hazard.
Hazard stabbed the defenders and left-footed Liverpool player Alison Becker to the net at the far corner.
Liverpool team in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15 p.m. at the Naples Stadium (Italy) with Naples.
Chelsea will meet Videoton at the UEFA European League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll is 832
As the country’s disaster agency reported earlier Sunday, Indonesia’s death toll from earthquakes and tsunami has risen to 832.
An agency spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroh said at a press conference that many people had been locked up in the collapse of buildings that were destroyed by Friday's 7.5-ball earthquake that caused a 6-metre wave.
The city of Pali, which has more than 380,000 people, has been devastated by the collapse of buildings.
Police Arrested 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Murdered Woman
The murder investigation was started after a woman’s body was found in Berkenhede (Mercedes) this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 p.m. at Greison Muuse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people who have seen or heard something in the area to say something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "For now, the investigation is early, but I would like to contact everyone who was near John Street Berkenhead and saw or heard something suspected of contacting us.
I would also like to contact everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have recorded something with a video recorder, and contact us because they may have information that is essential to our research."
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Berkenhead and she was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who knew my wife came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are still ongoing, as police have reported that they are informing the victims’ closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Greison Muuse had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one could enter and leave the building.
He lost his promise when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told that they will have to wait a few hours until they are allowed to return home.
It was heard as a police officer explained to one man that the entire territory is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared in the scene of the crime.
She said, “It’s so scary.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans stood in front of the fence on the inside and another van on the outside.
Many officers were standing on the inside of the fence and were watching the multi-family quarter.
Anyone with any information is requested to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, specifying number 247 on September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statues are smashed with the last hit of the "historical rewriting" dispute.
Its removal would be poetic justice for the actions of the Taliban, reminiscent of the destruction of England’s cultural and religious heritage, which is responsible for the fanatical followers of the Kremlin Puritans.
However, Cromwell's association described Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current discussions on the transfer of the statues to the Westminster Palace, the statue of Oliver Cromwell was inevitably to become a target.
Cromwell did not command or execute the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps not that Cromwell will be rewarded for the actions of his grandfather Tomo in the last century.
The magnificent image of Cromwell created by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft is a reflection of the 19th-century approach and part of the figure that many still deserve to be honoured.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people, perhaps richer in the late 19th century than today, considered Cromwell to be a parliamentary defender against external pressure, and this was, of course, a monarchy.
Whether this is true or not, historians still argue.
One is that the conflict of the mid-17th century formed the later development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exceptional figure representing one of the sides of this takosky.
His achievements, as the Lord’s defender, are also worth mentioning and honoring.”
Pig kills deadly killer of Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in the southwestern Chinese market.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found, who was surrounded by blood and lying next to a pig's market in Guizhou Province (South China) due to the damaged artery.
On 30 May 2005, a pig breeder in Sining (Chinese Province, China) prepared to inject vaccines for pigs in pig breeds.
He said Wednesday he and his half-brother from the neighboring province of Junano would travel to the market to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the half-brother spotted the dead relative and found the door open to the nearby pork.
He said the pig had a large hole, the mouth of which was stained with blood.
According to the report, a court review confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms killed a farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," the cousin said, citing his name Wu.
The camera's footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his half-brother.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig had to be locked up so that it could no longer kill other people, and kept it until the police were collecting evidence on the spot.
It is reported that the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating for compensation for death.
Although few, cases of pig infestation have been recorded earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly dangerously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 295 kilograms pushed a Welsh farmer to the tractor and pushed the animal to the ground.
After a 2012 Oregon farmer was incarcerated by pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that aggression can promote blood taste.
“You’re just playing.
They like to hunt, they're very curious... they don't seem to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them appropriately,” he said.
Hurricane Roosevelt’s “residues” will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Roza is forecast to weaken as it moves through cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Roza will bring plenty of rain to all of northern Mexico and the US southwest.
On Sunday morning, at 5 a.m., Roza moved at 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane and was 620 km southwest of the Euchenia Peninsula, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific side begins to form a steep low-pressure area and moves east towards the U.S. west coast. As Roza approaches the California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to carry a large tropical rainforest.U.S. moisture in this
On Monday, some areas of Mexico will cause up to 25 centimeters of rain.
Then the tropical moisture, interacting with the upcoming low-pressure area, will bring extensive rainfall to the southwest in the coming days.
In place of 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rain will result in dangerous sudden flooding, flow of debris and possible descent in the desert.
Due to high tropical humidity in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, precipitation falls from 5 to 8 centimeters per hour.
It is expected to rain between 5 and 8 centimeters in the southwestern regions, especially in a large part of Arizona.
Due to the nature of the rainfall, the rainfall may be caused by sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In the event of tropical storms, a particularly bad idea would be to get into the desert on foot.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into creeping rivers, and overcrowding can cause wind and dust to the dogs.
The upcoming low-pressure areas will bring some local heavy rainfall to the southern coast of California.
It is likely to get more than 1 centimeter drops, which can cause a small flow of cracks, and the roads can become slippery.
This will be the first wet season in the region.
Some of the tropical rainforests will begin to approach Arizona on late Sunday and early Monday, and later rain will spread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains from Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Yugoslavia will continue on Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S., as the Arctic cools, but in the tropical zone it will be quite hot.
Sometimes this results in massive temperature changes over small distances.
Sunday was a great example of huge temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperatures in Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) vary by almost 20 degrees from the temperatures in St. Louis and Di Moine (Ajova).
In the next few days, keeping up with the summer heat should rise again and cover more places.
It is expected that in much of the central and eastern parts of the United States, from the Great Southern Plains to the northeastern regions, a warm October with a high temperature of 27 degrees Celsius is coming.
Temperatures in New York on Tuesday should rise to 27 degrees Celsius, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests that in the eastern United States the temperature in the first half of October will be higher than the average multiannual temperature.
More than 20 million people watched Bretto Kavanaugh’s trial
More than 20 million people watched six television broadcasts on Thursday paying attention to the statements of Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh and the allegations of sexual violence by women Christine Blasey Ford in the 1990s.
But the political blindness continued after broadcasters paused regular programs on Friday for a last-minute change: Arizona senator prepared an agreement for the FTB to conduct a week-long investigation into allegations of misconduct.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that it was absolutely true that Kavanaugh had robbed her at a high school party and tried to pull her off her clothes.
Kavanaugh was angry at testifying that he was absolutely certain that it was not.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people watched the broadcast, which may be the case.
The company calculated the average number of viewers who watched the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in counting people who watch TV in offices.
To make it more understandable, it is the audience of the same size as would be formed during the contested football matches or the Oscars.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, was the first of all networks to reach an average of 5.69 million spectators in a day-long court hearing.
ABC, with 3.26 million viewers, was second.
Nielsen reported that CBS received 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC - 2.89 million, CNN - 2.52 million viewers.
There was still a lot of interest after the court hearing.
The main character in Friday's drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was picked up by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning when protesters shouted at him while trying to take him up to a court committee meeting.
CNN filmed it directly with its lower eyes when it was flooded by people.
“I’m standing in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, added that he would have more to say at a court committee hearing.
Cable TV and broadcasting networks later discussed directly when the Court Committee voted in favour of Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FTB would investigate charges against the candidate in the coming week, which were called for by a minority of Democrats to investigate.
Flake, speaking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was partly convinced.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was clear that Republicans would not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh's absence of the investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the FTB on suspicions against Kavanaugh.
Britain's Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused her plans to exit critics of the European Union “in playing politics” with Britain’s future and in order to harm national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published after her photo on the first page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called “Brexit” plan that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other, and absurdly said that it “was.”
Wayde Sims Shooting Police Arrested Suspect Dytheon Simpson for Death of LSU Player
Police arrested a suspect in the shootings of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported that 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials posted a video of the Sims and Simpsons clash, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the raids.
The CBS branch of WAFB reports that police took the glasses from the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
After interviewing Simpson, police said he had shot Wayde dead.
The lawyer said the bail for his release was <0x24>350,000.
The East Baton Rouge parish expert service released a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of the death was a shot in the head after it crashed into the neck.
The department is awarded to the Louisiana State Police Refugee Working Group, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the district residents who helped during the investigation, after which the suspect was arrested.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the district for its “cleanness and enforcement of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
A 1.98-metre-high boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, the youngster scored an average of 5.6 points during the game and caught the 2.6 kicking ball.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "blocked" and "shocked".
“We’re thinking about it all the time,” Wade said.
Ugnical explosion in ash in Mexico City
Ash erupted from the Popocatepetl volcano, which reached the southern vicinity of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano when the activity of the crater was activated and emissions of gas and ash were recorded 183 times in 24 hours.
The center has watched a lot of crashes and earthquakes.
The photos on social media show car windscreens covered with a thin layer of ash in the surroundings of Mexico, such as Cho<0xC4><0x8D>imilke.
Geophysicists have noted that the activity of a volcano 72 km southeast of the capital increased when a 7.1-ball earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Donu Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Before the vote on independence, the annual police met with the Catalan separatists
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence were confronted with riot police and thousands joined opponents' demonstrations to mark Catalonia's first round of voting on the anniversary of the separation.
The masked separatist group of police were covered in eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
The police used the sticks to stop the strikes that started the day.
Within hours, the group for independence, singing "Unforgettable, unforgivable", met with Unionist protesters who shouted, "Live Spain!"
The local press said 14 people were being treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is decorated by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region seeking independence remain high.
The majority of voters decided to become independent, but because of the majority of people who boycotted the vote, who did not want to split up, the voter activity was low.
Catalan authorities said last year that nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes in the region in an attempt to stop voting in the vicinity of the elections.
Independence groups set up a camp on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to change the route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer sure about the prospect of Catalonia’s independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
“I watched parents shout joyfully to those who could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite the fact that the regional elections in December last year had a vital and difficult victory, the independence parties of Catalonia have struggled to keep up the pace this year, when many of their best-known leaders have failed to keep pace and have been forced into self-determination or self-determination.
Police backing 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, after filming the protest on his phone, said the conflict was caused by politicians from both sides.
“The tension is constantly rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriolis Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained in a pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Candidating for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repressions demonstrated by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonder. Arrested in the house by car men
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed into a London house.
The incident occurred on Thursday at around 19:30 (BVL) Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building were damaged.
At some point in the car, it could also be shot with an arrow.
The men's strike secured Livingston's 1-0 win against the Rangers
Livingston player Dolly Menga's first shot guarantees victory
Relocated to the top level, Livingston surprised the Rangers, forcing Ibrox club manager Steven Gerrard to lose second out of 18 games.
Dolly Mango's strike proved very important because in a moment, Gary Holt's team made a deal with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains unsuccessful in the Premier League season and will meet the Hearts leaders next Sunday, from which they are eight points behind.
Earlier on Thursday, the Rangers played at home with Vienna’s Rapid.
At the time, Livingston extended his unrivalled series of unbeaten matches in the division to six, and head coach Holt has not yet felt the taste of the loss, as Kenny Miller only replaced last month.
Livingston misses chances in matches with static guests
Even before the Holt squad hit, due to its resilience, the Rangers had to be ahead of a variety of problems for a long time.
At first, Scott Robinson smashed and knocked across the gate, then Alan Lithgow was unable to reach the ball handed over to Craig Halkett, and he crashed next to the gate.
The hosts weren’t worried about letting the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could make guests trouble by creating standard positions.
This is how a decisive action was taken.
The Rangers spent a free kick and Livingston began to push forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly handed the ball to Menga, and he gained a shot from the middle of the penalty pitch.
Since then, the ball has been controlled by the Rangers for a longer time, but the hosts' defense has been invincible and goalkeeper Liam Kelly has barely had a job to do.
Such a robbery continued in the second ladder, although Kelly had to deal with the knocking of Alfredo Morelos at the gate.
Scotto Pittman's shot was fired by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and after another Lithgow hitting the standard position of Livingston, the ball ran by the gate.
When the ball was passed, Livingston was constantly knocked out on the penalty area, but each time it was cleared, with two penalties being imposed – one for Hallett’s collision with Glenn Middleton after the match, and the other for the ball’s loss.
Analysis of the performance of the phenomenal Livingston
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal "Livingston" game and result.
For everyone up to one, they were great and continued to exceed expectations for an ever-evolving game.
The style of the game and the staff almost did not change from the return to the top level, but great earnings should be allocated to Holt, because when he arrived he ignited the team.
There were a lot of heroes talking to him.
Captain Halkett played amazingly, focusing on a well-organized defense, and Menga valued Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall not to lose vigilance.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
While under the leadership of Gerrard, they are playing well, but this time they are missing a lot to reach their level.
They beat little of the decisive blows and only once broke through the defense of the hosts. A certain alarm call to the Rangers team located in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an met in Köln several times.
On Saturday (September 29th) there was a smiling and blue sky when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was President Erdogan’s last controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
The leaders disputed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turkey outside of Turkey.
Police have banned 25,000 people from camping in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom are Kurds, have also tried to be heard condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to accept him in their own country.
Various protests show the splitting of visitors: some German Turks consider him a hero, while others call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford. A cyclist died in a car crash
In London, a cyclist died in a car crash.
The accident occurred near Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a junkyard of Deptford Road, in the southeast of the city, around 10:15 PM BVL.
The driver of the car stopped, the paramedics also arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed in Childers Street, a sub-contractor who then fled, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
City police said officials were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
The roads are closed, and bus routes are changed, drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartino prison. Six officers wounded during a collision
The prison service reported that six prison officials were injured during a high-rise in a special men’s security prison.
The meeting took place in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Vuster<0xC5><0xA1>yre on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. BVL, where it continues.
Special Tornado officials were invited to control this incident, which involves eight prisoners and takes place on one wing of the prison.
Officers are treated for minor facial injuries at the site of the incident.
A prison official said: “Specially trained prison staff were invited to manage the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for the injuries.
“We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are sure that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police and, if possible, will spend more time behind bars.”
The HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that a prison administrator was being treated at the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot relievers were summoned to prison to handle a serious riot, during which some of the workers were covered with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens with its sudden floods to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (this can be useful for dry areas)
It’s not uncommon for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it’s likely to happen next week when Hurricane Roza and its remaining energy will sink through the desert southwest and this will cause a sudden flooding risk.
The National Meteorological Service has already announced to monitor a sudden flood on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, extending south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Jutland, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that on Monday, as it gets closer to the rain, on Tuesday Roza will be heading straight to Phoenix.
The National Meteorological Service in Phnom Penh noted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or tropical depression no further than 322 kilometers from Phnom Penh since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane no more than 64 kilometres from the Arizona border.
Using the latest models of the National Hurricane Center, it is predicted that the tide will drop 5 to 10 centimeters, and in some areas of Arizona Mogolon Rim, the drops will reach 5 centimeters.
Other areas of the desert southwest, including the central Wally Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to reach between 2.5 and 5 centimeters, and some may fall down to 10 centimeters.
For people who do not experience sudden flooding, Rosa rain can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these precipitations can be beneficial, as afternoons are currently suffering from droughts.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring center, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s population suffers from very high droughts, which corresponds to the second-highest category,” weather.com said.
First, Hurricane Rosa travels to the coast of the entire California peninsula that belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still equivalent to the hurricane category with a huge wind of 137 km/h, is 619 kilometers south of the Euchenia Peninsula, Mexico, and moves north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific region and is therefore serious.
It is therefore expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm forces on Monday afternoon or evening.
Critical precipitation in certain parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
"From the California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora is expected to reach 8 to 15 centimeters, but a possible thing - and a drop of up to 25 centimeters," Weather.com said in a statement.
Then Roza will move north through Mexico as a tropical storm, later on Tuesday morning reaches the Arizona border as a tropical depression, and on Tuesday evening again through Arizona to South Jutland.
“The main danger expected from Rosa or its remains is very high rainfall on the California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora and southwestern U.S. desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is believed that these rains will lead to life-threatening sudden flooding, debris flows in deserts and descents in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsamer Norton. Arrested four suspects in attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The young man was found wounded in Midsamer Norton in the terrace area of the “Excelsior” area, around 4:00 p.m. according to BVL, on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in stable condition.
Eivon and Somerset police said a 17-year-old man, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man had been arrested in the Radtok district.
Officials have contacted all persons who may have any material filmed on their mobile phone about what happened.
He said that Kavanaugh was “harmed by the ugliness of the Democratic Party, anger.”
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote we would like to reject the ruthless and offensive Democratic Party tactics," Trump said in a speech in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump said Kavanaugh had "experienced the ugliness and anger of the Democratic Party" during his candidacy process.
Kavanaugh witnessed congress on Thursday harshly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were still a teenager.
Ford also testified in court on his allegations.
On Saturday, the president said: “Americans saw Kavanaugh beautiful, noble and brave on that day.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a credible reputation in the field of public service,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy, while talking about the importance of Republican election activity in the midterm elections.
“We have five weeks left until the most important elections in our lives.
“I’m not really involved, but I’m really involved,” he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
He said the Democrats were trying to "resist and obstruct."
A senior GOP assistant told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia continue to rise
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were displaced by huge waves on the beach when a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at the Palu city beach festival on Friday, when a six-metre-high wave struck the coast, many of whom were deadly lighting up and destroying everything that happened on the road.
After the tsunami, there was a 7.5-ball earthquake.
“When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run away, so they became victims,” a spokesman for BNPB Indonesia’s Disaster Reduction Agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugro, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The cus did not rush himself, he pulled the cars, the bars, the houses, he hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coast, the open sea was running at 800 km/h.
He said some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived it.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu centres.
Images from the air show that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges slipped and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to be shaken by repeated strikes.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported that the energy released during the particularly strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It is reported that the cunami could have been strengthened due to the geographical location of the city, so it was laid out at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "great" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the building’s wreckage, later adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing without knowledge.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be greater along the coast, 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Dongala, which is close to the earthquake epicenter.
Nugroho said the networks were "completely paralysed, so no information was obtained" from Dongala.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross spokesman said, adding that workers and volunteers are going to disaster-affected areas.
It has been said that "it can already be considered a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse."
On Saturday, the agency was highly criticized for not reporting that it had hit Paula with a gunshot wound, although officials said the waves had come after the warning was issued.
In the shared social media amateur material, you can hear a man on the upper floor of the building, who is beckoning about the upcoming tsunami to people on the street.
Within a few minutes, the water wall bursts into the coast, bringing buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the filmed material.
The earthquake and tsunami disrupted the supply of electricity, disconnecting the networks around Palu, and it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate the provision of assistance.
Authorities said the military from Jakarta and other cities had begun sending cargo planes with aid supplies, but the evacuated people still needed food and other essential necessities.
The city airport was reopened only to provide assistance and will be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
Indonesia’s tsunami killed more than 800 people.
It's very bad.
Doseba reported that when World Vision personnel travelled safely from Dongala to the city of Palu, where the workers were getting closer to the pavilion tents built in the office yard, images were accompanied along the way.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began taking complex steps to provide assistance in the event of an accident, some people complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience were banned from travelling to Palu.
In accordance with the Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff employed abroad can only be assisted if the location of the accident is declared as a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani told reporters.
“When the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can ask for international help, but that status has not yet been published.”
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and loved ones of the missing people hoped that their loved ones would be part of a miracle that would impact the story of natural disasters.
A little boy was removed from the sewers on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been imprisoned for two days in the wreckage next to her mother’s body.
Indonesia's national sports team coach Gendon Subandon has trained two missing athletes at the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of the Roa Roa inmates at the hotel, including Monday, were his students.
“Because I am an elder in the field of parachute sports, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon explained in detail how in a few hours, after announcing the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, the news was travelling under the umbrella of the sports community. He desperately sent messages using the WhatsApp app, Palu wrestlers, who participated in the festival.
But his messages contained only one gray, not two blue shells.
"I don't think that means the message wasn't received," he said.
Newport on the Levee ATM stole <0x24>26,750
According to a Newport Police Department press release, the thief stole <0x24>26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink's employee who filled the ATM at the Newport on the Levee.
“The car driver was a busy ATM in the entertainment complex and ready to add more money,” Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man “flew out of behind the back of a Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money to supplement.
According to the press release, witnesses have seen several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police were unable to determine the number of people involved in the crime.
Any person with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. The rapper changed his name to Ye
Repertoire Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, when he announced changes to his Twitter account, he wrote, "A person formerly officially known as Kanye West."
K. West, 41, has been called Ye for a while and named the eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes began before Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
The show has to replace singer Arianna Granda, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
It’s not just an abbreviation of the current professional name – West said earlier that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think yes is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘two’,” West said earlier this year when talking about the album’s name with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, that means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and became simply Ye, which means a reflection of our good, evil, confusion, everything.
The album is more reflective of who we are.”
It is one of the many famous repertoires that changed its name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced a preference for the names of Love and Brotherly Love.
West's former colleague JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without a thumbnail.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel López Obrador (abbreviated AMLO) vows not to use soldiers against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country's 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students approaches.
López Obrador on Saturday pledged to “never use military forces to deter the people of Mexico” on Tlatelolco Square.
On October 2, 1968, when left-wing student movements began throughout Latin America, representatives of the military fired at the square for a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people.
López Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans every month by subsidizing students and opening more free state universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities include young people in criminal groups.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
“As China is becoming more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in the field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI specialist at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were awaited after various U.S. government bodies published reports on artificial intelligence, even the fact that the U.S. at all is not an official artificial intelligence strategy.
China, meanwhile, unveiled a plan last year, aiming to be a leader in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A doubled budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the United States and are expected to see another breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Duplicate funding could double the likelihood that another major achievement of artificial intelligence will be in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Artificial Intelligence Superstates: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, investing in one of China's leading <0x2B>artificial collaborators.
In the 1990s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked with an artificial intelligence system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, and later became the head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged earlier U.S. government technology contests, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and, in order to help find more insightful people, asked when the next one would be.
Lee said that U.S. scientists often have to work hard to win state grants.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have employed the bright minds of universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts for artificial intelligence.
“I think that doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council announced its plan for the development of the new generation of artificial intelligence.
In addition, Lee said, the Chinese National Science Foundation finances people from academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocating money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners from industry and the academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA (the agency for advanced defense research projects) announced about <0x24>2 billion in investment for the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
However, nothing has been done in the coming months about the U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, an act that resolved a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is home to the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means claims to the territory of Greece and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists claim that the name change would damage the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether voter activity would reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to enter into force.
The referendum question on the voting card: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership after agreeing to an agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that has fallen into Yugoslavia, is worth paying the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians to be able to live freely, protected by the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
While it is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said that they will follow the results of the vote and make them decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be required to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of violations by 13:00.
However, voter activity reached just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old elector of Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zorana Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko vote in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name to open the way for NATO and the European Union.
The 54-year-old parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of the tents built by a boycotting referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not to enter through the door of the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we don’t want to be accepted as Macedonians, we can drill into others, such as China and Russia, and participate in Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate reaches more than 20 percent, would attract such necessary investments.
“I believe the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said the “yes” result would be “safeguarding our future.”
According to a poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters are expected to participate in the referendum – less than the required activity of voters.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian television Telma, 57 percent of respondents are preparing to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of the respondents said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, 50 per cent of the voters must participate in it plus one vote.
If the referendum failed, it would be the first serious failure of the government's failed government policy since it took power last May.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero defeats all of Brighton's defenses and profits
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defense, and Manchester City on Saturday, playing at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, scored a 2-0 victory.
Aguero was hit in the 65th minute, seemingly incredibly easy.
The Argentine striker got the ball in the middle of the square at the start of the attack.
Before jumping into the open field, he ran between the three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero surrounded four players with green t-shirts.
He slammed through one defender, before that, on the edge of the Brighton Penalty Square, he swung several others.
Then he handed the ball to the left where Sterling was.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero with a single hole from the penalty area and hit the right leg to the right side of the net, defeating Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has foot problems,” City chief Pepas Guardiola told reporters.
He said he played for 55-60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were fortunate to have won the war at that moment.”
However, it was Sterling who helped the Sky Blues to advance in these Premier League matches.
The game was won in the 29th minute.
During the attack, Aguero got the ball in the depths of the Brighton pitch.
On the left side of the square between the two opponents he handed the ball beautifully to Leroy Sane.
Sane pushed the ball forward with a few holes, until Sterling slipped towards the further rope.
The Sky Blues attacker kicked the ball to the goal before slipping out of the square.
On Tuesday, 12:55 p.m., City will meet Hoffenheim in the Champions League group matches held at the Zinsheim Arena Rhein-Neckar (Germany).
Scherzeris wants to play friendly matches with "Rockies"
After the Nationals dropped out of the relegated competitions, forcing again was no longer important reasons.
Competitively positioned, Scherzer hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to stay in the contests; in the West national league they tie the Los Angeles Dodgers one point.
The Rockies on Friday night, after defeating the Nationals with a score of 5:2, have at least secured a chance to get a discount card, but will still have to try to secure the right to play in the first division.
“While we’re playing for nothing, at least we’ll be able to run to the pitch knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where the crowd and the other team will gather, will probably be at the highest level we’ll be able to reach this year.
Why don't you come?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the start of Sunday's matches, but they are clearly inclined to release Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be 34 in the statin of the match, took a kick-off training on Thursday and took the position on his usual day of rest – Sunday.
Washington's right wing statistics this season: 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 cars in a 220 2/3 lift.
A short speech in West Virginia.
Speaking of the importance of the Republican electorate's activity in mid-term elections, the president indirectly recalls the situation regarding the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we have achieved will be placed on the scales in November.
We have five weeks left until the most important elections in our lives.
“It’s very important, I don’t run... but I run, that’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Then he continued: “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see how it is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how evil it is.
They don’t care what they hurt, what they’ve been through to gain power and control; that’s what they really want – power and control, but we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and block".
“And you’ve seen this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “bad, bad, low-minded and wrong people.”
He referred to the Senate Courts Committee, citing Senator Dianne Feinstein’s name, which has sparked huge audience ovations.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you stolen the document?
Oh, um, how.
No, um... no, I’m waiting for one—it was really bad body language—the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Workers have lost their diversity of opinions.
They do not tolerate those who openly express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted for mistrust of me, I wonder if I should have been surprised.
Finally, I am the last of the Labour MPs who have been told that I am undesirable – and that is for my opinion.
My colleague, MEP Joan Ryan, received similar threats because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
My distrust was expressed in criticizing me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, on similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that “we want a large number of members to participate in the meetings and that the meetings will be productive.”
For most of those eight years, when I was a local MP for the Liberal Party, Friday night’s GC meetings were exactly like this.
It is sad that today the tone of many meetings is not at all the same and the promises of a "softer, more pleasant" policy have long been forgotten, even if at all it has ever been implemented.
It is increasingly clear that a different opinion in the Labour Party is intolerable and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, and my colleagues, who, as I previously thought, had similar political views, began to hope that I would be at a 180 degree angle and hold on to the common opinions that I would never agree with, whether because of nationalism or the EU.
When I speak in public – and no matter what – there is a scrutiny on social media of insults that encourage my resignation, condemn the policy of the centre and say that I am not a member of the Liberal Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I have been much more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to withstand a handful of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things in this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the same party of opinion, and with every “distrust” procedure or alteration of the electoral system, this party becomes less and less.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice that encourages me not to jump out, not to talk so loudly, and then with me “everything will be fine”.
But I didn’t come into politics for that.
Since I joined the Liberal Party 32 years ago as a student, I have been provoked by Thatcher’s government’s negligence, which, in the true sense of that word, has ruined my entire school class, aiming to provide better public services to those who are, or who are, the ministers of the state.
I have never hidden my policies, including the recent elections.
No one at Nottingham East should have been surprised in any way by my political views and disagreements with current leaders.
To those who promoted this procedure on Friday, I can say that when a country turns to Brexit, which affects households, businesses and public services, I do not realize the desire to waste time and energy because of my loyalty to the leader of the Liberal Party.
But in fact, one message that I have in the Nottingham Momentum for my voters, members of the Liberal Party (or not): I am proud to serve you and I promise that any threat of cancellation or political purpose will not allow me to act in accordance with your interests and beliefs.

"Ayr" - "Melrose" - 38:17 Invincible "Ayr" conquers table tops
Two late attempts distorted the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved this triumph in the impressive, promising Tennent's Premiership Day matches.
The team is now at the top of the table – the only one that is unsuccessful.
Ultimately, the victory was brought to them by an impeccable defense and a well-exploited opportunity, so coach Peter Murchie may actually feel satisfied.
"We've put up all the tests in all the matches that have taken place so far, and we're still unsuccessful, so I'm really happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Ayr turned out well, the players took better chances than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which Frazier Climo successfully finished, led Ayr forward, but the yellow card to Rory Hughes, who was released on the square by Warriors, allowed Melrose not to collect the number of hits, but to be found by Bagda.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a penalty when before, during the very middle of the competition, he earned points and successfully completed a personal test, helping Ayr before the break unveil a score of 17:5.
However, Melrose’s second pick started well, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt, which was successfully completed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
The matches were suspended for a longer period of time as Ruaridha Knott suffered a severe injury and was pulled out of the leg. After the prolonged match, Ayr continued to lean forward when Stafford McDowall's trial was successfully completed.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and Melrose tried to take advantage of the player's excess, but Bruce Colvine's attempt at the end of severe pressure was unsuccessful.
The home team player returned, but after Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for stopping Climo without the ball, MacPherson pushed the ball off the penalty line for the ongoing Ayr squad.
Climo successfully completed his test, as he had done almost since the start of the match renewal, after Kyle Rowe arrested David Armstrong's fence in the corner of the square and prevented the country's attacker Gregor Henry from holding the fifth battalion of the home team.
Still Game star appears to be ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to be ready to move to the housing and catering sectors after he was announced as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old man in a popular BBC comedy plays Jack Jarvis, writing and acting alongside his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duets announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the final season of the show, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Kraiglang.
Officially, it has become the directory of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on this fact, although Scottish Sun sources said Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's "running restaurant business".
'We Own the Sea': Bolivian Prisoner Expects Court to Re-Open Sea Traffic
Marines patrol the navy’s headquarters in La Pase.
There is a blue flag of the ocean on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with a slogan: “The sea belongs to us legitimately.
It’s our duty to get it back.”
Throughout the country, Bolivia still has live memories of access to the ocean, which was donated to Chile in the bloody 19th-century conflict over resources, alive and long enough to be rebuilt in the Pacific.
The hopes raised over the past decade have now been greatly strengthened, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice, which will be published on October 1.
“Bolivia is focused on the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes for positive results,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will watch the announcement of the TTT ruling on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will take a positive decision on Bolivia’s complaint that Chile will be obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia, an Indian who is awaiting a controversial election fight for re-election, is also very interested in the outcome of Monday's decision.
“We are very close to having the opportunity to return to the Pacific Ocean again,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts tend to think that it is unlikely that the court will take a favourable decision for Bolivia, even if it did, little would change.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to demarcate the territory of Chile and has indicated that no possible outcome of the negotiations will be established.
The fact that the TTT’s decision will be announced only six months after the last arguments have been heard hardly indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And even if Bolivia managed to push something, the last four years could have blocked it back.
“This question about access to the sea was raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
She believes that any remnants of Chile’s goodwill were destroyed by the vengeful Morales rhetoric.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the talk at some point, but after all, it will be very difficult to discuss.
The country has not changed its ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
“Bolivia will have an exclusive opportunity on Monday to start a new era of relations with Chile and to end 139-year-long disagreements for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, and uses the issue of the sea as political manipulation.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“A decision is an opportunity to see that we have to reconcile with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his people would never give up nuclear weapons first if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises, which the leaders of the rival countries agreed on during the meeting in Singapore.
His remarks were made at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently intended to renew the stalemate of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting with Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the "utopian dream" is that the continued sanctions and the U.S. rejection of the declaration on the end of the Korean war could ever be stalled by North Korea.
Washington avoids endorsing the declaration if Pyongyang does not take convincing disarmament actions in the first place.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But the widespread skepticism that Pyongyang does not seriously intend to give up the arsenal, which the country seems to see as the sole guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare ground for the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show has revealed that the latest trend is massive headdresses, and they will quickly conquer the nearest fashion stores
If you want to supplement your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is just for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide assortment of eccentricly large headwear in their 2019 spring and summer collections, and it has simply embellished spectators of the Paris Fashion Week in its style.
These particularly impractical hats conquered the social network Instagram this summer and these designers presented eye-catching works on the podium.
The distinctive work of Valentine was a huge body-colored hat, decorated with a wide, feather-like edge, captivating the mannequin’s head.
Other non-standard-sized accessories were cut-out pearls, wizard hat and even pineapple – but they’re not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange masks – at the same time to Heloin.
Many colorful masks were knitted with lipstick and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of the works looked like a member's costume, with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other reminiscent of a melted ice cap.
And if you have sex with this huge fashion trend, you won’t ask.
Experts in style predict that these huge outfits can be accessed in stores.
Huge hats were popular with La Bomba’s high heels, leather hats with two foot edges already worn by everyone – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created extremely impractical hats that conquered all social networks, released another huge piece on the podium – a northern beach bag, almost the same size as a bathing suit worn by a mannequin.
The red brick rafting basket, decorated with rafting corners and a white leather handle, became the exclusive highlight of the Jacquemus collection “La Riviera SS19” during the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said FEMAIL: “I think that next summer, huge hats and beach bags will come to stores because the designer has made such a big impact, so it would be hard to ignore the need for non-standard sized accessories.”
John Edwards: “Speaking languages is a very important skill for the world’s citizens”
Scottish independent schools have improved academic achievement records, not releasing in 2018, and once again demonstrated exceptional exam results, only further reinforced by individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other fields.
With more than 30,000 students studying throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide the highest possible level of services to their students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and become citizens of the world.
Working in the education sector, which is able to develop and implement the planned school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and are gladly chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you can talk to a man in a language that he understands, he will understand you in his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak to his heart.”
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent exams, we can say that languages are at the peak of popularity and are characterized by the best survival ratings in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign-language students received the highest A rating.
The data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A rating during the Mandarin language exam, 72 percent received the highest A rating, and 63 percent of those who studied German, and 69 percent of those who received the highest A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland regard foreign language learning as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language, as an elective subject, is now considered as as important as key subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the programs of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission, 17 percent of employers were found to be inadequate in their language skills for all the reasons that made it difficult for them to fill jobs.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more compulsory for young people to be prepared for their future careers.
Because the opportunity to work in the future will depend heavily on languages, these skills will become essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses to learn a second language, in the future he will be far superior to others if he has these skills that are lifelong.
By being able to communicate directly with people from abroad, a multilingual learner will be much more competitive.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to participate in the conversation, while French was the only language spoken by the two-digit and 15 percent.
That’s why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
By learning a few languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs according to the languages in which it is taught.
Numerous schools focus on more classical contemporary languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important to the UK in terms of the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in an independent school, with training staff and specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are ready to create an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to live in the future.
It is undeniable that in today's world of business, languages remain vital for the future of a country, and this must also be reflected in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should certainly be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and outcomes to the young people of Scotland.
It is necessary to do so.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will start his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
There’s not much to wait for fans to see how LeBron James will start the Los Angeles Lakers season.
Lakers coach Luke Walton said James was playing Sunday's opening game with Denver's Nuggets San Diego.
How many minutes of play is unclear.
“It’ll be more than one minute and less than 48 minutes,” Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudella said on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers in six pre-season matches.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to get ready,” he said.
Short speech in West Virginia, on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign in Willing, West Virginia, this evening.
This is the first of five planned speeches by Trump next week, including stallions in friendly-located areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
When voting to approve the suspension procedure for the nomination of his chosen Supreme Court candidate, Trump seeks to concentrate support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans were threatened with losing control of Congress in November.
Will Trump speak in West Virginia in an hour tonight, and how to watch it online?
The short speech in Willinge, West Virginia, scheduled for 19:00 EDT on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia online on the following YouTube broadcast.
The short is likely to touch on this week’s Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh as she put a lot of strain on suspicion of improper sexual behavior when the Senate voted to suspend the nomination for a week before the FTB conducts the investigation.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength in the coming November elections.
President Trump’s campaign says the goal of these five meetings next week, as announced by Reuters, is to “energize volunteers and supporters who are trying to defend and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so important on his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible, because a very hot campaign season starts,” Trump’s campaign spokesman said.
“The speech planned at the Wesbank Arena in Willington should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media,” the West Virginia Metro News said.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month, a state that won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Short is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is in the lows according to polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to top him,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup Tournament: U.S. team set off for military and hopes to enter Sunday's Unit Competition
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, quarterbacks can be just what you needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a swing of success is completely invented, but the players really believe it, especially in competitions like this one.
So on whose side is success now?
"They were first six points, and now four, so I guess we can think of it as such a success," said Jordan Spieth, preparing for the day.
Of course, Europe is in the lead, has a four-point re-consideration and there are still twelve games to be played.
American enthusiasm, according to Spieth, has faded, and they don’t miss it, not to mention the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was invincible from the beginning to the end and the first was impeccable.
With those wild victories continuing in the round, Thomas gained two points out of the two possibles in order to finish the fourth match in a straight line.
His strike, winning them the match in the 15th duo, was accompanied by similar slogans, which seem to have said the American team is not finishing yet.
“We just need to focus and take care of our games,” Spieth said.
Now each of these players has to be played separately.
By the end of the year, 18 of them were successful.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, unquestionably the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe scored four points out of four possible and can be calm.
“Moliwood” was the only couple to not only need additional strokes on Saturday afternoons, but also on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and Friday mornings.
That course of events and the reaction of lovers of spectators only confirm that they will be the players who will win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve such popularity as Fleetwood or Molinar, who, in the wake of the last European rays of sunrise, will have a golf course at Le National.
It would be nice to have both of them at the same time.
It’s too early to talk about Europe’s glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played briefly with Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero of the morning when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An additional stroke and two double additional strokes during the first nine shootouts pushed the Spaniard and the Swede into trouble, from which they were unable to get rid of it.
No one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four-ball and four-match matches are so interesting to watch for the interaction between the pairs, for the advice they give and the advice they don’t give, and for the fact that the strategy can change instantly.
Europe played better as a team, so it came to the final with a strong lead, but this fourth stage also showed that the U.S. team has a fighter’s spine, which some, especially in the states, doubted.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup competition, Europe takes the lead 10:6
Europe will meet on the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant overhaul, after Saturday's fourth stage leading against the United States with a score of 10:6.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario continued to warm the atmosphere by winning two wins against hard-fighting Tiger Woods and took the lead by four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, to save the trophies that Hazeltine had lost two years ago, dominated in the four-match matches of the morning against the unsuccessful American side and finished the stage with a score of 3:1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the quarterbacks when it won two matches, but was unable to overcome the points overweight
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12-unit matches to keep the trophies in their hands.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row when Molinar and Molliwood doubled Molliwood after a thrilling weekend, and they are only the second pair to win four points in their first four Ryder Cup matches.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quarter-finals, they impeccablely disrupted confidence after losing Woods and American new Bryson Dechambeau with an even better score of 5:4.
Woods, who did not win two Saturday matches, showed a high level of professionalism at times, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his matches in the quarterfinals, seven of them in a row.
Justin rose in the morning quadruple and returned to play with partner Henrik Stenson in the quadruple; they beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world rankings.
In spite of a pleasant, gentle day in the southwestern part of Paris, Europe didn’t feel like butter.
The three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas raised the American cartel, winning two points on Saturday.
In four-ball matches, they scored an unsuspecting 2:1 victory against Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter, and in four matches they defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3, failing to beat the ball in the first two innings.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team managed to recover the four-point oversight by going to individual matches, although the Furyk side would have enough equals to keep the trophies.
While two days were in second place, Sunday's success from them seemed to fall apart.
North Korea says it will in no way arm unilaterally, without being able to trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that in such circumstances the country would certainly not unilaterally give up nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant goodwill measures” in recent years, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing bases and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
“But we have not received a similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without any trust in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be unilaterally the first.”
While Ri has repeatedly heard North Korea’s complaints about Washington’s opposition to a phased approach to nuclear disarmament that would reward North Korea for its actions in stages, his statement highlighted the fact that he has not rejected the idea that Pyongyang would completely reject the idea of nuclear disarmament.
Ri recalled a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump during the first meeting of the US president and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the “disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised to secure this.
North Korea is aiming for a formal end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to ease the severe international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. calls for nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its target by compulsory methods, even by denying declarations of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“To think that we can be surrounded by sanctions is the same as having utopian dreams for people we don’t care about.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader underlined earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: “If another country on this issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea, not the United States, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula would not have been accepted.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech changed dramatically compared to last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that when “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Winter “Mr. of Rockets” a suicide mission, North Korea’s missiles were still in the US.
In the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, criticized Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said there was still a lot to be done and that sanctions must continue until North Korea enters.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no timetable for this, saying “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have said the UN Security Council should pay back to Pyongyang for its actions.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s sanctions must be decisively continued without making any concessions until a definitive, evidence-approved nuclear disarmament is carried out.”
The Security Council has unanimously endorsed North Korea's sanctions since 2006 to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the back of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to clear the ground for the next meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has been unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that all the progress was only for North Korea to announce after a few hours that he had made “gangsteric demands”.
North Korea promised to dismantle its missile base and nuclear power plant during its meeting with Moon this month if the United States “takes appropriate measures.”
According to him, Kim claimed that the "appropriate measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and a move to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn to Rest Enough
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all of its students to sleep more in order to fight the growing mackerel culture in their studies by consuming caffeine and not falling asleep at night.
One academic found that at the world’s best university students often don’t even have basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Ceisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigadier Sith, a specialist in women's hospitals, developed a course, which he said was the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration to prepare for this course visited him after speaking about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the tongue, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why is it that I’m only being told about it now, during my last year of study?’
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important quality sleep habits help achieve academic and sports results, improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s executive director of the department of health services, said the university decided to offer this course when it turned out that students were very lacking sleep in a week.
The validation duration course covers a series of interactive tasks.
One section contains a photo of the hall where students can click a cup of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to learn about caffeine, the effects of light, how sleep deprivation affects sports performance and how important it is to sleep routine.
In the next section, participants learned how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A student site map with interactive icons that encourage participants to think about their daily routines.
“We understand that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we think they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the health consequences when you choose to smoke,” explained Professor Ceesler.
The culture of pride in not sleeping overnight, according to him, still exists. Modern technology and increasing pressure on students led to the growing problem of sleep deprivation.
“To make sure that you have enough and quality sleep, there should be a student’s secret weapon in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he said, “even avoiding gaining weight because sleep deficiency switches the brain to hunger mode, so students are constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Ceeseler prepare for a course when last year, his first year at Harvard, he attended one of his lectures.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to apply for a course available to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all undergraduate students to listen to this course before starting to visit this competitive institution.
Professor Ceisler advised students to set an alarm clock when it’s time to go to bed, just like traveling, and to guard against the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and light-emitting diodes, because they can shatter the backbone of your circus.
"Livingston" 1:0 "Rangers": Men's takeover upset Gerrard's men
The Rangers experienced another disappointment when Dolly Mengai managed to beat the weak Steven Gerrard with a 1-0 score.
Ibrox hoped to earn his first victory in the February trip with a 4:1 St Johnstone result, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games and now the last team is eight points behind the long-distance runner-up.
I was hit seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration, the Rangers didn’t see a chance to level the score.
The Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston rose to third place, and from the Hibernian is left with only one draw.
And the worries of the Rangers don't end there, because it's likely that the butter thing from the tribune hit the head of the side judge Calum Spencer and wounded him.
Gerrard made four changes that allowed Ayr to bend and led to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt relied on the same monk who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have liked how his well-thought-out combinations accumulated opponents at every step.
The Rangers dominated control of the ball, but Livingston did more with it.
They could have hit the second minute when Menga passed the ball to Allan McGregor's invader Scott Pittman, but the guard ruined his chance by turning the ball away from the goal.
After Keaghan Jacobs' long-running free kick, the ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his opponent defender Alan Lithgowas asked for the country.
The Rangers took control, but the last third of the matches were just hope, not faith in their game.
Fifteen minutes later, Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty when he faced Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson complained to the Columbian.
The Rangers were only able to strike twice in the first ascent, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was scaryly frightened by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot or a gentle pairing with Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s 34th minute may not match the game, no one will argue that they deserve it for their efforts.
The Rangers have not succeeded in overcoming Jacobs' defense again.
Scott Arfield did not resign when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his nickname and handed it to Menga for easy finish.
During the break, Gerrard took action replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the change almost immediately resulted when the National Guard played Morelos, but Kelly's impressive runaway defeated the strike.
Livingston included guests in a game that he liked – with the long-distance transfers of Lithgowo and Halkett.
Holt's team could eventually increase their oversight, but McGregor recovered from Jacob's blow after Lithgow's handing out of the corner.
After the move to the Rangers, Glenn Middleton appealed again at the end of the game for a penalty after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanach: The Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, today it was 136 years ago and MORE... That day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention, which later developed the device, is known as Geiger's calculator.
Since then, this device has become a hit in the world of science, and later a hit in popular culture, when in the 1950s film Bells of Coronado, the cowboy was played by not very reminiscent scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger meter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When these ears are closed, you can actually hear how the atoms work, touching the radioactive effect in the minerals."
Evans: “No, it’s really shooting now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that was given his name still lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to Develop Bad Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to Develop and Kill Bad Cells
The vaccine has taught the immune system to recognize bad cells – this is part of the treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory
Then the cells can "see" the proteins that are characteristic of many forms of cancer, and are again injected back
The trial vaccine yielded many promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
One woman treated with this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory, then the cells can see proteins characteristic of HER2 type cancer, and are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results we get suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and rectum,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells are extracted from patients and learned to adapt to cancer cells, was successfully applied in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye’s West released a short-supporting tyre wearing a MAGA hat after his performance in the SNL show.
Well, it wasn't over.
After an unpleasant performance at Saturday Night Live, viewers embarrassed Kanye West, who praised U.S. President Donald Trump; he said he would participate in the 2020 campaign.
After performing the third song "Ghost Town", during which she wore a hoodie with the inscription "Make America Great", she continued to condemn Democrats and expressed support for Trump.
“How many times have I been talking to white people, they said, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if racism were to bother me, I would have left America a long time ago,” he explained.
The SNL show began with a comedy scene in which Matt Damon called from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate Courts Committee on charges of misconduct by Christine Blasey Ford.
While it was not broadcast, filmed with West's replies on social media was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to get out of West on this record.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had an inconvenience in the back of his head.
“They’ve been in my backyard.
He told me not to go there with such a squirrel.
They're kidding me!
They said I reached the bottom," he said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see what the bottom is? <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> He asked. <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> I have a superman hat and that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?
Begin to love.”
His statements caused at least twice disagreeing slogans in the audience, and members of the SNL broadcaster seemed depressed, as Variety reports. One man said in the media: "There was a deadly silence throughout the studio."
West was promptly asked to replace singer Arianna Grande as her former rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West had many of his performances in which he performed the song "I Love It" and wore a Perrier bottle costume.
He received support from Conservative group TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "To one of the bravest men of the spirit: THANK YOU FOR THE MINISTER."
But talk channel leader Karen Hunter posted a post on Twitter that West was simply “it was himself and that’s incredibly awesome.”
“But I choose NEVER a man (by buying his music or his clothes, or by maintaining his ‘art’) whose beliefs are a toxic ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we're also free," she added.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now formally known as Kanye West.
He was not the first to change his name, but went the same way as Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was originally named Snoop Lion; the music legend Prince's name was changed to the symbol and later became known as Prince's.
Allegations of knife attack at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder when a man was wounded by a knife on Friday in eastern Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred in Balihakamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates’ Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor.
Star of "South Wars" Next Harington Criticizes Distorted Attitude to Mentality
The next Harington sounds like the sword-moving character John Snau in HBO’s fantasy adventure series about the medieval Wars of Horses.
But the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of the hero of the match. He claims that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel like they should be tough to be respected.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Another said that he thinks "something is wrong" and raised the question of how to tackle the problem of distorted masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Another man, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie, admitted that the theme was “strongly touching.”
“I feel like this topic is touching me very much now. Where did we make the mistake of educating masculinity?” he asked.
“What do we teach growing men to face such problems?”
Another thinks that, partly because of this distorted wave of masculinity, television could be responsible because it creates very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television or on the street so that young people are convinced that they must be marked by this kind of masculinity?
I think this is one of the most important questions of our time – how can we change it?
I think we’ve made a mistake with young people somewhere.”
In the interview, he also confirmed that he would not participate in any pre-wars or sequels when the series ends next summer, and said that “he already has enough battlefields and horses.”
From November Next will film Sam Shepard's "True West" in the modern version. It is a film about the robbery of film directors and his brother.
The actor recently unveiled the best thing that happened to him in the "Wars of Horses", where he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife in this series, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and a future life,” he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played Igrita, another character's love object, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 in a property belonging to the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people were infected with the infection in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the newly infected people were sexually transmitted, and this is different from past statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection in some parts of China is rapidly spreading due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV has declined to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, over time, the number of people living with HIV infection and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is an opus issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because conservative values prevail in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men are ultimately led by women.
Most cases of infection with this disease occur due to improper protective measures during such sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised global access to HIV medicines as one of the ways to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that workers hacked Republican senator data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. spokeswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees had posted personal information from three U.S. senators on Wikipedia’s pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by ultra-right-wing experts and websites.
"Lies, lies, and again a nasty lie," Waters said on his Twitter account.
The disclosures included U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrino Hatcho, both from Jutland, home addresses and phone numbers.
The information appeared online on Thursday, it was announced by an unknown person from Capitol Hill at the time the Senate was prosecuting charges of improper sexual conduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The missing information appeared shortly after the three senators posed questions to Kavanaugh.
“Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of these records was associated with the Waters office and the information of the Waters employee was disclosed,” the Capitol reported.
“These unfounded suspicions are completely false and absolute lies,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security has been affected by these fraudulent and false suspicions is in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
These unfounded suspicions are completely untrue and absolute lies.”
Waters’ statement quickly received criticism on the internet, as well as from former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds bad,” Fleischer wrote.
"It says she doesn't have enough self-name to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of things they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
He should not defend.
He should not question the defendant’s motives.
It should be calm and humble.”
Seemingly, Fleischer tried to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic critic Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who participated in the mid-term election campaign to replace Waters, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's true if it's not a lie," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the organizers are clarified, she continued, that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all without exception to my staff.”
Johnny Ingles is smocking again – a parody of spies with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for Brexit clues in any British film. The same can be said about the recovery of the action comedy spy franchise "Johnny Inglesh" – "Johnny Inglesh" was started to appear with "Johnny Inglesh" in 2003 and "Johnny Inglesh" in 2011.
Will this sarcastic autosatisfaction about how we have clearly agreed to become a new possibility for national exports?
In any case, incompetent John England with his wide eyes and rubber face has a second chance to bring to the surface unpleasant truths <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> the name itself clearly indicates that this comedy work is intended for non-English-speaking cinema regions.
Of course, this stupid secret agent, who, while claiming to luxury, has acquired some of the qualities of Inspector Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean's character and a little bit of a resemblance to that man, recalls the theme that was used in the 2012 London Olympics in the ceramics.
He is also a somewhat based character about a traveler and a mysterious man, causing the chaos that Atkinson once played in a now forgotten Barclaycard TV ad.
There are a few beautiful moments in this new Johnny English film.
I liked John Ingles approaching the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the whale rotor crashed into his helmet.
The comedian Atkinson’s talent is obvious, but the humor itself seems exaggerated and strangely excessive, especially when serious movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible are boldly incorporating elements of the comedy.
The humor is as if it was more for children than for adults, and I don't think the adventures of John England seem as inventive and tactile as Atkinson's silent jokes of playing Mr. Byn.
The most common issue nowadays is that the UK is in serious trouble.
The cyber-attacker successfully hacked into Britain’s highly classified internet spy and revealed the identity of all the British spy in the area, causing the agent’s anger – the overly insignificant role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop in the Prime Minister’s, a pompous and corner-mounted character’s bowl, who already suffers from a staggering political impopularity: Emma Thompson from Theresa May’s character squeezes everything she can, but the script doesn’t provide good material for it.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to search for people among retired.
This means that you will have to contact John Ingles himself, who is currently working as the director of the school at some prestigious institution, but who provides illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent. Here were some good jokes.
The English are sent back to Withol to discuss emergency situations and there agrees to his long-time common Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a man associated with the submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine, acting as a high-profile girl, seems inadequately exploited.
Then Batman and Robin, able to confuse all matters in Her Majesty's secret service, take action again and meet with Olga Kurylenko's fatal beauty, Ofelia Buletov.
The prime minister is dangerously squeezed by a charismatic billionaire who says he can solve the problem of Britain’s computers, namely the vicious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
The Englishman and Bough start their dress: dressed in waitress, they set fire to a French restaurant, cause chaos on a luxury yacht in Volta, and the Englishman starts a complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality headsets to get to know the inside of Volta.
All the stoppers were clearly retained for this last series, but no matter how pleasant or wild, all of this resembles children's television.
It's pretty average.
As with all the other John English films, I couldn’t get rid of the thought: the British film industry can’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really be worth his talent?
Labour Party denies plans for British workers to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Party of Liberals is planning to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but that would be paid for five days.
It is reported that the party wants corporate leaders to share the savings accumulated by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, giving its employees one day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy the three-day weekend and bring the same amount of pay home together.
The source says that this idea is in line with the party’s economic agenda and plans to push the country’s development toward workers.
The transition to a four-day week was also welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the benefits of a changing economy.
According to The Sunday Times, “a review of the policy provisions is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is consistent with the Party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the Party's overall industrial strategy."
The Liberal Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party also promised a four-day week of campaigning for the 2017 general election.
However, this idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party at the moment.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and it is not considered in the party.”
A spokesman for the shadow government, John McDonnells, took the opportunity to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at a Liberal Party conference last week.
Mr. McDonnells said he was determined to take power from “unwitting dictators” and “commercial hunters” utility companies.
Such shadowy chancellor’s plans also mean that current water companies’ shareholders may not be able to recover their full share because, seeing the violation, the liberal government may be able to deduct something.
It also endorsed plans to include employees in the company’s board of directors and to set up inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the capital of private-sector companies to employees, and they could receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond to 60 Minutes question whether the FTB survey on Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FTB's investigation into the allegations made to Judge Brett Kavanaughi has delayed the final vote for at least a week, whether to be referred to the Supreme Court, so the question arises whether the facts clarified by the Bureau of Investigation could not affect any of these monsters, such as those of the old republics.
Scott Pelley, a correspondent on the 60 Minutes channel on Sunday, asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could happen that the FTB would find out something that would change their mind.
Senator Kennedy has a more liberal attitude than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Well, yes, of course,” said Mr. Kennedy.
“As I said before the meeting, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
When that happened, when these accusations appeared, I called him and asked, "Did you do that?"
He replied decisively, firmly, unambiguously.”
So Mr Graham’s opinion seems to be unchanged.
“I’ve decided on Bretto Kavanaugh, there should be some really distorting accusations,” he said.
“For Dr. Ford, I don’t know what was there, but I know one thing: Brett is categorically denying it,” Graham said.
“Nobody can confirm what she calls it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t think there will be anything new.”
What is the World Citizens Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
The World Citizens’ Festival will be held in New York on Saturday, an annual music event featuring an impressive number of stars and aiming at an astonishing goal – to eradicate poverty in the world.
For the past seven years, the World Citizens’ Festival will be held on the Great Pyramid of Central Park to meet tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but will also spread more about the real goal of the event by the end of the 20th century.
The World Citizens’ Festival was launched in 2012 and is a continuation of the World Poverty Fighting Project, an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty with an increasing number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concert attendees had to perform a variety of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world leader, calling for information or calling another phone.
But will the citizens of the world succeed in achieving this goal? 12 years remain until the deadline is set.
Will the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really convince them to demand and urge to act? Perhaps this is just another example of so-called clickivism, fictitious activism – people think it will really change the situation by signing an online petition or post.
According to the organizers of the World Citizens Festival, since 2011, the movement has recorded more than 19 million actions of its sponsors, encouraging the achievement of a wide variety of objectives.
According to the report, world leaders have announced <0x24>37 billion in commitments and policy strategies to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and statements that had been prompted by the group’s actions, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been paid or raised.
Almost 649 million people worldwide have been affected, according to the group’s calculations, with the funds secured directly.
Some of the key commitments include “The Power of Nutrition” – a partnership of investors and executives operating in the United Kingdom, which aims to “help children grow up and uncover their full potential” in an effort to solve the problem. The problem has not been solved in the past.
“With the support of the UK governments, sponsors, governments of countries and people like you, the citizens of the world, we can achieve that such social injustice as nutritional inadequacies would become the past,” said London Ambassador of Culture, Tracey Ullman.
The group also said that after receiving 5,000 applications calling for improvements in the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for the “Mind Power” project, which will reach 5 million women and children in nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the DUK's questions on its website, "Why do you think we can eradicate particularly great poverty?",
Citizens of the world respond: “This is a long and difficult road – sometimes we will clap and fail.
But like the big movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win because we are all stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the performers participating in this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
According to the Secretary of the Interior, the U.S. could use the navy to block Russia’s energy exports
“If necessary, Washington can use the fleet to deter Russia’s energy markets, as well as the Middle East markets,” U.S. Secretary of State for Internal Affairs Ryan Zinke said in a statement.
Zinke argues that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think Russia is intervening in the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy sector, just as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this issue.
“The U.S. can do this by using the fleet, it can make sure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, it can make sure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke told the participants at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called the US "the voice of energy consumers".
He further compared Washington’s approaches to those used in dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are essentially the same.
“Iran and Russia’s economic alternative is to find a greater or lesser reservoir that would replace fuel,” he said, calling Russia a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements appeared to the Trump administration in its mission to increase its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace Russia on the market, offering a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the unsuitable North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a Moscow prisoner.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11-billion-value Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington’s close opposition to the project is only economic, an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all agree that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has received a hostile reaction from Germany, reaffirming its determination to continue the project.
Germany’s main industrial organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I really disagree with the interference of the third country in our energy supply issues," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering raising her nomination in the 2020 presidential election.
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was seriously considering running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the Massachusetts Roundtable in Hollywood, E. Warren confirmed that the candidate was considering a candidate.
“When it’s time for women to go to Washington to handle our fallen authorities, they have to go to the top position,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential election.”
During a meeting at the city council, Warren harassed President Donald Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am very frightened by the way Donald Trump treats our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticizes Trump and his proposed nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren said in a tweet on Friday that "until the vote, it is undoubtedly necessary to conduct a FTB investigation."
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that most voters in the state of E. Warren do not think she should run for president in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the Safolk University Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of likely Massachusetts voters say the senator should not take part in the election.
Thirty-two percent supported her nomination.
The poll showed that more support is received by former Governor Deval Patrick – 38 percent support his possible candidacy, and 48 percent oppose it.
The names of the Democratic Party’s candidates in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said the official decision would be taken in January, according to the Associated Press.
Donald Trump's meeting with Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic disorder
26-year-old Track Palin, who joined the military in September, spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, after an incident of domestic violence, he was arrested and charged.
“I see what my son is experiencing, what he is facing when he returns to everyday life, so I understand the other families who are experiencing the effects of post-mortem disorder, and some of the wounds of our soldiers that they are returning to Oklahoma,” she said.
Palin called his arrest a avoidable truth. She said that his son and other war veterans "return after a little change, they return with a stronger heart, they return wondering whether they will get respect for what their fellow soldiers and all the soldiers of the war are."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasile, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and assault against a woman, as well as allegations of harassment of domestic violence in possession of a gun and in disability, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasile police department.
18 states and Colombian county support opposition to new asylum-seekers policy
Eighteen counties and Colombia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that refuses to give asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of 18 states and districts in Washington presented amicus curiae (a court consultant) comments to support the questioning of asylum seekers' policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace v. Sessions trial, which the American Civil Liberties Union launched against federal policy, is not disclosed.
She says her partner "and members of his criminal gang" were violent against her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Grace-supporting state lawyers have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the U.S. receives many asylum applications, as a state that is plagued by persistent gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has repealed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Board of Appeal to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Carl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “is not subject to decades-long state, federal and international laws.”
“Federal law requires decisions on asylum applications to be taken in the light of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and with such prohibition this principle is violated,” said amicus curiae.
In this remark, lawyers also say that the policy of banning immigrants from entering the country is damaging to the U.S. economy, and that immigrants are more likely to engage in business and provide “needed employment services”.
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions said in June that judges on immigration issues should no longer provide asylum to runaway victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fears of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or certain political views,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been the goal of solving all the problems (not all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Two-fold increase in the number of victims in Palu, desperately searching for survivors
The situation of the survivors is constantly deteriorating.
“The tension is very high,” says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, calming her baby’s son in the center of the city’s evacuation.
“We’re still carrying more and more bodies.
“Clean water is missing.”
It has been observed that residents return to their homes in ruins, pick up water-cracked items, try to save what they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and 7.5-point earthquake hospitals were damaged.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture in the back and shoulder, are lying outside at Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside for severe repeated strokes.
His eyes are full of tears when he tells how the hotel’s fifth-storey room, in which he was staying with his wife and daughter, felt a sharp earthquake.
“There was no time to save others.
It seems to me that I’ve crossed the walls of the wreckage,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come with his family to the city to attend the weddings.
“I heard my wife’s call for help, and then I was silent.
I don’t know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they're all right."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassing propaganda
Last week, when the official Chinese newspaper distributed four-page advertisements in the U.S. newspaper, suppressing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned the addition of the most expensive newspaper in the state of Ayia, the Des Moines Register, paid for by the China Daily, and accused China of influencing the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections.
"The allegation by Mr Trump that Beijing is trying to influence the U.S. election marks a new stage in Washington's strengthening campaign to put pressure on China," U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war, and both sides are based on tariffs on each other’s imports of goods.
According to experts from China and the US, China’s response tariffs have been applied to exporters from Ayov and similar countries that supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, a long-time governor of Ayava and one of the major exporters of agricultural production to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Mr. Branstad said that China "was even more deliberate about printing propaganda in the press in our own free press."
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government has used America’s respectful freedom of speech and press and ordered a paid advertising message from the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In the meantime, you won't find voices against each other in a local Beijing press kiosk, and you won't create a real video that reflects the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, because the press is behind the strong Chinese Communist Party."
Branstad also added that “one of China’s best-known newspapers was exhausted from his offer to print” article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: Kavanaugh’s fiasco deters Republican voter in mid-term elections
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has even been charged with sexual harassment, the analyst warned that it will receive a negative response during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from teachers.
The situation is very emotional, and many Republicans already officially claim to want to hold a vote.
Such things can’t be taken away later,” said Grant Reeher, a professor at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, to The Hill newspaper in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether the last-minute calls by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to launch a FTB investigation would be enough to reassure bad voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will remember it both tomorrow and November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national representative for the MoveOn Group of Progressives on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted, “November is coming!” during a demonstration by the Senate panel, when the Republicans controlling the Court Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s demonstrations.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will fall across the board,” Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
“People say she’s still strong, and they’re right.
But it could further strengthen positions, especially among undecided women voters in suburbs and younger voters aged 18-29 who, although disliked the president, often simply do not vote.
Even before B. Ford made public statements when she detailed allegations of sexual harassment to a candidate in the Supreme Court, analysts said that if Republicans approve the nomination, it could cause anger.
“This has caused a lot of confusion for the Republican Party,” former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee or the final vote, not just about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed as a judge, but also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated Mr. Ford,” Guy Cecil told the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree on what to believe after the demonstrations of Mr. Kavanaugh and Mr. B. Ford, although it also gets a little more support.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents fully or probably believe in Mr. B. Ford’s performances, and 35 percent fully or probably believe in Mr. Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was really or probably lying when giving a lecture, and only 30 percent said the same thing about Mr. B. Ford.
Asked by Mr. Flake, the FTB is currently investigating the allegations made by Mr. B. Ford and at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford sworn in to the Senate Courts Committee last week, stating that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17.
Mr. Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her her her genitals at a party they attended while studying at the University of Yale on the 9th.
Web Inventor Plans to Establish New Internet to Oppose Google and Facebook
Global network inventor Tim Berners-Lee is creating a new startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor, Inrupt, is a company whose work is based on the Berners-Lee open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and what information they have access to.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that the purpose of Inrupt is to control the world.
“We have to do this now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The Solid technology-based application allows people to create their own personal online data store (POD).
It can contain lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal or work tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify would be available in one browser at the same time.
The online store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides who and what information can access.
The company calls this the empowerment of an individual through data.
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the idea is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, an IBM-built security platform, a number of programmers hired to work on this project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can develop their own decentralized apps using the tools listed on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not agree with Facebook or Google on changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
Berners-Lee said in a press release on Saturday that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the durability and quality of the new Solid-based network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a Web consortium at the Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in the debates on internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about this new web era,” Berners-Lee added.
Honourable Bernard Vann – Winner of the Victorian Cross in World War I
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his birth in his hometown, he was honored as the only priest of the Anglican Church, awarded the Victorian Cross as a fighter during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Pastor Bernard Vann was awarded the prize during the invasion of Belenglish and Lucknow on September 29, 1918.
Unfortunately, after four days, the pastor was shot by a sniper, so he remained unconscious that he was awarded the highest-ranking British military award.
During the parade in Ra<0xC5><0xA1>dene, Northamptonshire, two grandchildren opened the memorial stone.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said the fact that the stone was set on fire just 100 years after Grandpa’s award-winning marching work was “very symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the lieutenant-colonel led his battalion through the St. Kent's Canal "smoking very thin smoke, sharply spreading fires of hulls and automatons."
Later, he hurried to the shooting line and “particularly galantly” led the line forward, and then one himself attacked the barracks and killed three team fighters.
The German sniper shot Lieutenant B. Vanna on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vanna said his grandfather’s actions were “some things that will never be the same, but at the same time, humility is very inspiring.”
After the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, Michael and his brother, Dr. James Vann, assisted the violinist.
Michael Vanna said that he had a great honor to participate in the parade, adding: “The true hero’s man is shown by the support that many people will give.”
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but had to meet "Beaulyte Pepa"
Imagine: you don’t go to sleep all night to see the sassy Bellator 206, but eventually you can’t see the main character.
There were 13 Marchs on the San Jose Poster, six of them on the main card and broadcast live throughout the UK through Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were shocked by the UK’s spectators, who stopped broadcasting the film “Pig Pep”.
Some spectators, to put it mildly, were not impressed, because it was precisely because of this struggle until the couple did not sleep.
On Twitter, a sigil called the change of the broadcast to a children’s animated film “something sick joke.”
"According to the rules established by the authorities, at 6 a.m., such content was inappropriate, so it was necessary to turn on the program for children," Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said in a statement.
“Yeah, I’m a pig.”
Bellator's president Scott Cocker said he will try to adjust the schedules in the future to take into account viewers in the UK.
“When I think about repetition, it seems to me that we could probably do it,” Cocker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m., Sunday, and we won’t be able to resolve it until Sunday at our time – Monday at their time.
However, we are already working on this.
Believe me, when you change the broadcast, you exchange many messages that weren’t all friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it is a matter of government.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six – as we usually do. We wanted to give the fans more, but it just failed.
This is an unsuccessful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels Unworthy About His Sexual Orientation
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling weaker than others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
24 athletes said only in primary school understood that they were not the same as everyone else.
For the first time in Desert Island Discs, run by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he had begun to speak publicly about gay rights because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that becoming a father was not as important as winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the head of this long-time cable company, has been retiring from work for several months due to illness.
In the first show directed by Laverne, where guests are asked to imagine traveling to an uninhabited island, T. Daley said growing up feeling weaker than everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to love both boys and girls.
He said: “Even to this day, that sense of weakness and differentiation has been an incentive that has given me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that he was worth it so as not to be disappointed by the surroundings when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The winner of the two Olympic Bronze Medals became a high-level LGBT activist and took advantage of the opportunity to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality as part of this year’s British Nations Games.
He said he began to talk about it in public because he thought he was fortunate to be able to live openly without any consequences, so he would like to give others such hope.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with Dustin Lance Black, the man he met in 2013, was unexpected.
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar laureate last year, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
According to T. Delay, when he was so young he was only 14 at his first Olympics, and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to accept someone of the same age, but experienced the same heights and lows.
In June, when the couple became the parents of their son Roberto Ray Blacko-Daley, T. Daley's perspective, according to him, completely changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have said that the most important thing for me is to win the gold medal,” he said.
But, you know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
Robis is my Olympic gold medal.”
His son’s name is the same as his grandfather Roberto, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
His father, Anto T. Daley, did not want to reconcile with death, so one of his last questions was whether he was already buying tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, which he was going to watch sitting in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” Daley said.
“I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and only then I finally recognized that he was not inviolable,” Daley said.
After a year, the athlete won the 2012 Olympics and mined bronze.
“I just knew that I had dreamed about it all my life – dancing in the water watching local spectators at the Olympics – there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired the choice of the first song — Heather Small’s work “Proud”, which performed his senses in the preparation of the Olympics and still pleasantly scratches the skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British Summer Time.
After losing form, Ph. Mickelson spent Saturday's Ryder Cup tournament on the floor
American Phil Mickelson will hit the record on Sunday as he will be 47 times in the Ryder Cup tournament, but in order for it not to become a failure in the round, he will need to improve his form significantly.
Ph. Mickelson, who has already played for the 12th time in two-year matches, was crowned by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's quarter-finals on the sole.
Instead of being at the action center, as was often the case in the United States, the main winner spent five times the day on the support team, and the rest improved his technique on the pitch in order to correct the game-hitting errors.
Even without hitting very directly at career heights, 48 athletes are not the ideal player on the slopes of Le Gold National squares, whose long slopes of rough grass are extremely unfavorable to unspecified hits.
In addition, as if the square itself weren’t scary enough, in the ninth game that will take place on Sunday, Ph. Mickelson plays against the highly targeted British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who together with the new Tommy Fleetwood won all four of these weeks.
If the four-pointed Americans manage to start the upcoming 12-unit matches well, the match of Ph. Mickelson can become absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, but he probably couldn’t speak otherwise.
“He understood perfectly the role he played today, paved my back and said with a hugged hand that he was ready to play tomorrow,” Furyk said.
He does not lack self-confidence.
He is on the list of the most prestigious athletes and has given a lot to these teams both in the past and this week.
I didn’t know he was playing two games.
I imagined more, but it went like this, so we decided that we would do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Dr. Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo's record and become the top player in the Ryder Cup.
It may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, as well as the unmatched heights of his personal records.
Ph. Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk claims that his presence has also brought intangible benefits to the team.
"He's fun, sarcastic, conscious, he likes to laugh at people and he's a great guy to be in the team room with," he said.
“I think it was fun for the younger players to fight with him this week as well, it was good to see it.
It’s more than a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big overshoot can quickly fade
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big rebound in the upcoming Ryder Cup finals can easily grow into a tough fight.
The Danish athlete made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderama, where captain Seve Ballesteros led the opponents' team had a five-point overrun against the Americans, but crossed the finish line only with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We always remind ourselves that we had a big overlap in Valderama; we had a big overlap in Brooklyn where we lost, and also in Valderama where we won, but just as soon as possible," said T. Bjorn (in the photo), watching the 2018 cable win with a 5:3 win and a 10:6 win at National Golf.
So the story will show me and all the members of the team that it’s not over yet.
Tomorrow you will need all your strength.
Go and do everything right.
Until there are no points on the board, the game is not finished.
We have a goal – to try to win this prize – so we must consistently pursue it.
“I’ve always said that I trust the 12 players who are on our side, but we know who’s on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult pitch, T. Bjorn added: “I wouldn’t want to run behind my eyes in any way.
Tomorrow is going to be a very different hairstyle.
Tomorrow, the most important thing will be the individual game – it’s completely different.
It’s great to play with your partner when everything goes well, but when you’re on the pitch alone, your ability to play golf is tested on the limits.
This idea needs to be put in place for the players – tomorrow you will have to push everything out of yourself.
He’s going to have to go out with his partner and he’s going to have to squeeze everything out of himself.”
Unlike T. Byrne, opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to appear better individually than their partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both sides of the last day’s surprises because Brucklaine was on the winning team until Europe performed the miracle of Medina and considered them losers.
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, when asked how 1999 captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players in preparation for the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but look for a quick start – one you’ve seen in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the acceleration occurs in one direction, very tense becomes the middle matches.
“We have formed our team accordingly and released the players in a way that we, you know, are trying to create some magic tomorrow.”
Thomas will have to try to lead a responsible fight and meet Rory McIlroy at the top of the game, and among Europeans lead Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
“I have chosen these men in this order because I think they will successfully win the whole game,” Bjorn said of his choice for the teams.
Delivery of New German Military Ship Delayed Again
The newest German Navy frigate was to start work in 2014 and replace Cold War war-era warships, but according to the local press, it will not be seen until at least next year due to the increasingly degenerative systems and the dramatic increase in prices.
According to a military spokesman quoted by Die Zeit, the release of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the military fleet in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was obscured by the problems that the ship already delivered took to the ground.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are believed to be equipped with powerful propulsions, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, and certain secrecy technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Another important feature is longer maintenance intervals, which allow the newest fregates to float away from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, due to the endless delays of the most advanced technology, military ships, which are said to allow Germany to direct military power to overseas territories, are obsolete before they begin to use them.
The unsuccessful F125 frigate was headlined last year when the German navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the shipyard in Hamburg, Blohm & Voss.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship that has already been delivered to the builder.
The reason for the return is little known, but the German press is aware of a number of major software and technical defects that would have caused the ship to believe in a military mission.
The lack of software is extremely important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will have a crew of about 120 sailors, which is more than half the size of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that this ship was significantly too heavy – this reduces its efficiency and limits the military fleet’s ability to implement various improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is estimated to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
The cost of the entire project – next to generating technical equipment, including crew training – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from the initial amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to the staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion).
The latest frigate-balling problems have become very significant following recent warnings that the German navy is declining power.
Earlier this year, the head of the German parliamentary defence committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, acknowledged that the military fleet "is indeed lacking suitable ships for use".
The officer said that over the course of time the problems had arisen, because the old ships had already been declassified, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of squirrels
A new study, conducted in one Scottish highlands, aims to reveal how squirrels use the landscape to hunt food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behavior of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future conservation activities.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will observe squirrels, soprano squirrels, brown earbuds and aquatic mice in the Vester Rose Invereve gardens.
In certain areas of the territory, special recorders will be deposited, allowing tracking of the activity of the squirrels throughout the season.
The National Health Service staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests with manual detectors.
An analysis by experts of all sound recordings will determine the frequency of signals emitted by whistleblowers and the activity of one or the other type.
Then a map of the residential areas and a report will be created, which will help to form a detailed picture of the behavior on a landscape-wide scale.
National Trust for Scotland (NTS) Nature Affairs Adviser Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are most important to sharks and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of residential maintenance work, such as the creation of slopes, and also to find out how to best maintain forest areas in order to make them suitable for slopes and other related species.
Over the past century, the population of squirrels in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined.
They are endangered by construction and real estate development works affecting laundry and the destruction of residential areas.
Wind power plants and beams, as well as mosquitoes, some chemicals used for the processing of building materials, as well as hunting domestic cats are also a threat.
The squirrels are not really blind.
However, catching a trap during night hunting helps the ears more than the eyes.
The tigers shall accurately determine the location of obstacles in the insect or flight trajectory by possible echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is extremely responsible for scaffolding.
There are ten trained experts working here, who regularly conduct tests, laundry checks and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created the first and only reserve for squirrels in Scotland in the Threave yard in Damfries and Galway, where eight out of ten species of squirrels in Scotland live.
Courtkeeper David Thompson says the court area is ideal for them.
“We have a great place for squirrels in the Threave yard,” he said.
– We have old buildings, lots of brandy trees and great areas to live.
But we still don’t know much about squirrels, so work here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need in order to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of checking the absence of squirrels before the start of the area care work, as the accidental destruction of one laundry unit could kill up to 400 girls and youngsters, which could result in the destruction of all local populations.
Squirrels are protected and prohibited from killing, irritating or disturbing them, as well as from destroying their peripherals.
Scottish Shield Protection Fund official Elisabeth Ferrell called on the public to contribute to the rescue of Shields.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our squirrels, and we don’t know how many species of local populations follow.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape – lawyers intend to bring German magazine to court
Cristiano Ronaldo called his allegations of rape “community” and said people were “looking to hear” using his name.
His lawyers have prepared the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which printed the charges, to be brought to trial.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus clubs is accused of raping Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he then allegedly paid the woman <0x24>375,000 to stop the incident.
Speaking to 142 million followers on the live-streamed Instagram channel hours after reports of the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo criticized the reports and called them "community".
“No, no, no, no, no.
“What they say today is a lie,” the Ballon d’Or winner said five times while staring at the camera.
When they use my name, they want to hear it.
That's normal.
They want to be famous, saying my name is part of my work.
I’m a happy person, everything’s fine,” the athlete added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to bring Der Spiegel to court for allegations they called “unacceptable publicization of suspicions about things happening in private space.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the athlete would seek compensation for "moral damages that would match the severity of this violation - perhaps one of the most serious violations of a person's rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at Palms Casino and Hotel Apartments in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted to the Nevada Clark County District Court, after a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete's room, where he allegedly raped her in an anal way.
Mayorga says after the alleged incident, Ronaldo attacked on the road and told her that he was a “99 percent good man” who was betrayed by the remaining “one percent” of his personality.
The documents state that Ronaldo acknowledged that the couple had sex, but claimed they were contractual.
Mayorga also said she had contacted the police and her injuries at the hospital were photographed, but later agreed to disagree with the court because she was “fearful of the actions of the respondents” and worried that she would be “publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to revoke the deal because she continues to feel traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was relegated from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer, after signing a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract, joined Italian giant Juventus.
‘Brexit’: the UK would regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
According to business secretary Gregor Clark, the United Kingdom would "forever regret" if it lost its global automotive manufacturing leadership status after Brexit.
He added that he was concerned about a statement by Toyota in the UK that Britain would temporarily suspend production at the Burnaston plant near Derby if it left the EU without a deal.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
Japan's automaker said a cross-border ban on Brexit would result in job losses without a deal.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European countries.
“In my view, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to stop production,” said Burnastone Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, have also expressed concerns about exiting the EU without an agreement and its consequences for international trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in a month after Brexit.
According to car manufacturers, the most worrying are the threats to the supply chain "Brexit" without a contract.
Toyota’s production line operates when needed, as custom-made car parts are delivered every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a contract on March 29, there may be disturbances at the border; according to the industry, it may cause delays in the delivery of details or a lack of them.
Toyota said that the Derbyshire plant could not store more than one day’s stockpiles, which would stop production.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “prepared precisely to avoid such border checks.”
"We need a deal, we want to have the best deal, which, as I say, would not only allow us to enjoy success today, but also take advantage of this opportunity," he told Radio 4 Today.
“Not only Toyota, but the data from other car manufacturers show the need for the continued use of a highly successful supply chain system.”
Toyota could not say for what time the production would be halted, but warned that looking at the long-term, additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouwallar, who has worked for 24 years at the Burnaston factory and is responsible for the union meetings at Unite, said his union members are increasingly concerned: “I say by experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a targeted and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
According to the White House, Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
“Continuing the fight for a candidate for Supreme Court judge, a very important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week,” the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, the latter investigating Russia’s interference in the elections, Trump’s relations with Russia, and a possible obstruction of the president’s fairness.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy prosecutor general, thus threatening Mueller’s independence, has been a long-standing blow to Washington for months.
The New York Times reported this month that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a microphone for conversations with Trump and the possibility of recording through the 25th Amendment to remove the president.
Rosenstein denies this report.
However, in the wake of the resignation announcements, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it announced that the meeting with Trump, which was at the time in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
The meeting was postponed to coincide with the Senate Courts Committee meeting, which witnessed both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accused of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump urged the FTB to investigate Kavanaugh’s allegations within a week, postponing the vote again in a Senate plenary session.
Short spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on the Fox news channel on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "His date is not set. It can happen this week, but given all the events related to the Supreme Court, it can be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like to report the news to the press."
Some journalists would disagree with this claim: since September 10, Sanders has not held a single White House press conference.
Chris Wallace was asked why.
Sanders replied that the press conference rarely takes place because he doesn’t like TV journalists who “follow the effects” and added, “I have to agree with the fact that they seek the effects for the audience.”
At the time, he said that he would communicate more often with the press directly.
“The president answers the questions more often than any previous president,” she said, adding, without providing any evidence, “we have reviewed these statistics.”
According to Sanders, press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We've often tried to do this and you've seen it happen many times in the last few weeks. Press conferences will replace your direct communication with the President of the United States."
Short is constantly answering questions when he leaves the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with honourable guests.
One person’s press conferences are rare.
The president’s free and sometimes strange speech against journalists this week in New York probably explained why.
Scottish Minister of Health writes to EU NST workers about Brexit concerns <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Scottish health minister NST wrote a letter to EU workers expressing their country’s gratitude and desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of permanent resident applications for EU citizens working in the public services sector that we have entrusted to it.
Freeman wrote in a letter: “The UK and EU withdrawal negotiations continued and are approaching the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has begun to prepare faster and a possible scenario without a contract.
I know that you are all very disturbed now.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how I value the contribution of all workers, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system, which are beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Emergency surgery for head traumatized Christian Abercrombie
On Saturday, during a 31:27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores team, an emergency operation was carried out for the defendant of the Tennessee State Tigers in Abercrombie, Tennessee journalist Mike Organas said.
Tennessee State chief coach Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma occurred just before the break.
“He came to the side line and there he just slipped,” Reed said.
Coaches and doctors at the sideline of Abercrombie breathed oxygen, later landed on the carriers and sent for further investigation.
Tennessee State Officer Chris Harris of Neshville (Tennessee) WSMV said Abercrombie surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center had been completed.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type and extent of the trauma" and the Tennessee State is trying to determine when it occurred.
Officially passing the sporting season, the second-class Abercrombie moved from Illinois and the Tennessee State team plays for the first season.
Before leaving the game, he scored five balls on Saturday, and the total number of balls he scored during the season reached 18.
UK Real Estate Buyers Will Have to Pay Higher Significant Taxes
Under the new Tori plans, UK buyers of real estate abroad will have to pay a higher significant tax, and the additional money received will be used to help homeowners
This step will reduce the risks posed by the successful Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
UK taxpayers will be taxed with a significant increase in taxation
The Ministry of Finance expects to be able to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, and will allocate them to help the homeless.
Today, Theresa May will announce that UK buyers of real estate will be taxed with a higher rate of taxation, while receiving additional money to help homeowners.
By promising more affordable housing and applying to high-income people, it is believed that this step will reduce the risks posed by Jeremy Corbyn’s successful campaign to attract young voters.
A significant increase in taxation will be imposed on UK taxpayers and businesses, and the additional money received will be allocated to the Government’s campaign to promote homelessness.
The additional fee – payable next to the current significant fee, including for purchasers of second houses or houses for rent that were introduced two years ago at higher rates – may be up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects this move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built real estate in London is bought by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, so many of the wealthy country and especially the capital districts have become cities ghosts.
The new strategy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a significant tax cut, thereby helping more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of quickly buying land, but not using it, of maintaining high real estate prices, and urged May to deal with the shame of Britain’s housing supply by refusing affordable house quotas.
Corbyn announced a number of eye-catching housing reforms proposed, including rent price control and a landing ban in the absence of guilt.
In addition, he wants more power to build new houses to provide municipal councils.
“Last year, I said I’m going to try to bring back the British dream – life needs to be better for every new generation.
And that means we need to fix our disrupted housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it is not fair that non-UK residents and overseas companies can buy homes as easily as hard-working UK residents.
For many people, the dream of having a home has become almost impossible, and the threat of homelessness is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's boss Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to ever become Scotland's selection leader.
The 42-year-old likes the challenge of reviving the North-East club, currently in third place in the first league and three points behind the first-place club.
Last season, after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish championship, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I went to the B's and it's over," Ross told the BBC's Scottland's Sportssound.
“When I was a kid, I grew up at Hamden Stadium with my dad watching a lot of Scottish selection competitions, and that always attracted me back.
It is true that this opportunity will only come if I manage the club successfully.”
Rosso "Sunderland" was led by Dickas Advocaatas, David Moyesas, Samas Allardyce's, Martinas O'Neillas, Roy'us Keane'as, Gus Poyetas and Paulo Di Canio.
Previously rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals, the former Alloa Athletic manager said she was not worried about starting to work for such renowned managers at such a big club.
“Now my success will be assessed by the answer to the question ‘Can I get this club back to Premier League level?’
“In terms of structure and conditions, this club is undoubtedly part of the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but maybe it’s only when I get the club back to level that I think I’ve worked successfully here.”
Rosso's leadership career lasted only three years. Prior to that, he worked as assistant manager at Dumbarton Club and replaced Hearts coach for 15 months.
He later helped recover in the third division of Alloa, and the club St Mirren, which was threatened with falling, became the championship winners the following season.
Ross says he is now more satisfied than he has ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“This change was probably radical,” he recalls of the leadership of Alloa.
“I honestly thought that it was better for me to lead than to play.
This sounds strange, because it followed me, I made a lot of money and I was happy with the happy victories.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to overcome a lot of problems every week.
And now it’s not easy – work stress and stress, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I've always wanted to lead, and I'm doing it now. When I grew up, I always felt like I was in my corners, but leadership gives me the greatest satisfaction."

The study found that the best time to drink beer was Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased the income of the poor British beers, but has made the burden of restaurant networks even more difficult.
The figures revealed that sales of beer and bar groups increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from CGA, a business consulting firm that compiled the data, said: “The unfinished sunset and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Championships meant that the same trend continued in July as it did in June, when the revenues of almonds fell below 2%.
In June, sales in restaurants declined by 1.8 percent, and in July, the situation became even worse.
The main revenues from beers and bars receiving beverages were undoubtedly the best, and trade in them increased more strongly than in restaurants.
While not as strong as restaurant companies, the sun was also affected by the main revenues from the food-trading algae.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and drink.
In well-managed beds and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent this month, and sales of food fell by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from RSM, an analyst in the leisure and leisure sector, said: “These results have continued to show a visible trend since the end of April.
When it comes to food establishments, the main factors remain the weather and the impact of the most important social and sporting events.
So it’s no wonder that restaurant groups continue to be poor. True, a fall in sales of more than 4.8 percent over a year will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to low-cost pressure.
Most of the earnings from the food trade companies during the long hot summer could not come at a worse time. Time will show whether a milder feeling of temperature in August will give the necessary breath."
Overall sales growth in beds and restaurants, including newly opened venues, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected a slowdown in the development of branded networks.

Twenty percent of students say they have a main account to show their parents.
One in five children – some just 11 years old – have secret social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Instagram pages – a link to Instagram’s photo sharing site.

Twenty percent of students said they use a censored parent account to show, but they also have secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret site for a three-year-old daughter, found out that the teen was insistently offering: “Violate me.”
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (MDK) found that 40 percent of 11<0xE2><0x8E><0xAF>18-year-old students have two accounts, and half of those students recognized accounts as concealed.
Mike Buchanan, the head of the MDK, said: “The fact that so many teenagers give up the temptation to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them is troubling.”
Eilidha Doyle to be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidha Doyle was elected as its Director-Advisor at the annual meeting of the Scottish Board of Sport Management.
Doyle is the award-winning Scottish lightweight athlete and president. Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for people leading the sport to take advantage of a variety of international experiences she has gained over the past decade.
“Eilidha has earned great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and global sports community and we have no doubt that its inclusion in the council will bring great benefits to Scottish sport,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to serve as the voice of athletes and I hope I will really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”

Breastfeeding advertising, comparing mothers to cows, received different reviews online
The breastfeeding company received differing opinions about its advertising, comparing breastfeeding mothers with breastfeeding cows.
In order to mark the launch of the product, which is described as the world's first silent portable breast lifting, Elvie, a consumer-oriented technology company, has released an ironic music video-inspired advertisement. It aims to showcase the freedom of movement, which is free to learn.
In the full carpet of the <0xC5><0xA0>iene, four real mothers dance according to a sound recording, in which they hear, for example, the words: “Yes, I’m whispering to myself, but I can’t see any tails” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not my tits, it’s my breasts.”
The addendum continues: "Take it out, take it out, I will feed it to the babies, take it out, take it out, I will suck my beauties."
However, the advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page caused an online dispute.
The video, which was viewed 77,000 times and received several hundreds of comments, was responding differently, with many claiming that it looked through the fingers at the horrors of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, only their newborns are removed from them after a few days,” wrote one woman.
“Elvie” breast breastfeeding unnoticed space in the breastfeeding pantyhose (“Elvie” / “Mother”)
Another commented: “It is understandable that it traumatizes both the mother and the newborn.
But why not take advantage of the advertisements that deliver breastfeeding to mothers from whom babies are not born?”
Another added: “Advertising is a complete misunderstanding.”
Another commentator defended the advertisement – one woman admitted that the song appeared to her “very fun”.
“I think the idea is great.
I would buy it if I still had food.
When I quit milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accept it as what it is.
This product is great," <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> wrote one.
Another commented: “This fun advertisement is for mothers who quit milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
Its purpose is not to drink or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they are all in shock with the invisibility of breastfeeding in their waistbands.
The idea of the campaign is based on the notion that many breastfeeding women say they feel like cows.
However, the "Elvie" milkshake does not produce any sound, does not have wires or pipes and noticeably space in the feeding pad – so women can move freely, keep babies or even leave the house.
Mother’s partner and CEO, Ana Balarin, commented: “Elvie’s dairy is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative start to market it.
When comparing breastfeeding women to dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the breakdown of milk and all its challenges, at the same time having fun and showing as much as possible the incredible sense of freedom that the new dairy will provide.
Elvie’s dairy drawing was not the first time in the press headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski’s collection of two children’s mothers demonstrated on the podium using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved to tent camp on the Texas border
Over the course of a month, the number of people crossing the border has not changed substantially, but the number of children of migrant detainees has increased considerably – in part because of the strict rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration made it harder for them to live with their caregivers.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers themselves were immigrant without documents and feared that they risked the possibility of staying in the country when applying for childcare.
After the federal government announced in June that potential caregivers and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and this data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk increased further.
Last week, Chief Immigration and Customs Officer Matthew Albence testified to Congress that the institution had detained several dozen people who had applied for adult care for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had not been prosecuted in the past.
“Almost 80 percent of these people – their guardians or their family members – live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
According to the asylum workers, in order to deal with cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules. According to them, some children must appear in court within a month of detention, not within 60 days, as was usual before.
Many applications for legal status against an immigration judge will try to defend not by coming in person, but by using a conference call.
Recognized persons who are not eligible for assistance will be deported soon.
According to reports received from the shelter staff and in recent months from the system, the longer children remain detained, the more likely they will become uncomfortable or depressed, which could encourage outbursts of force or attempts to escape.
Defenders argue that this is even more worrying in large institutions such as the Tornillo shelter: because of their size, there is a growing likelihood of signs that the child is shivering.
They added that moving children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma of many already experienced.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem has invited Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in Syria that has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as the Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces that have taken up the pretext of combating terrorism in Syria are illegal and will be treated accordingly.
“They have to leave immediately and without any conditions,” he said to the Assembly.
In Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have left their homes, the war on terrorism is almost over.
He said Damascus will not continue to fight this holy battle until we destroy terrorist groups in all the territories of Syria, and any aliens who are illegally present.
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and President Bashar al-Assad's dissuading Syrian Arabs.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking about the refugee problem, Moualem claimed that the conditions for their return were good. At the same time, some Western countries accused them of spreading unwarranted fear that deterred refugees from returning.
“We have joined the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them come back,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will receive reconstruction assistance only when Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent Russian-Turkish agreement to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created conditions for faster political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has allowed to avoid a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces aimed at a province with three million people.
However, he stressed that the agreement had clear terms and hoped that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-related Nusra front, which would be destroyed.
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a committee of government and opposition members to prepare a draft post-war constitution in Syria and prepare the ground for the elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions under which the Syrian government will participate in the committee – the work of the group should be limited to revising articles of the current constitution – and warned against interference.
Why will Trump be elected to a second term?
Based on this logic, Trump would be elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators would probably expect, his presidency would be preceded by accusations and scandals.
This would be the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!
There are no signs of fatigue of the spectators.
Since 2014, CNN’s best broadcast time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers with the best broadcasting time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show ranks first in the ratings of cable television with as many as 3.5 million viewers.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because we don’t understand something,” said Neal Baer, who is producing the ABC series Descendant about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack that has ravaged the House of Congress.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of “Only fun parts and a few unpleasant truths about how to secretly get into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"He said, 'He's kidding me,'" Scovell said.
Chaos is worth it when it comes to recreation.

During the tense mid-term elections in the House of Representatives, money from the environment flows
It is no wonder that due to the reorganization of congressional districts, which ended in an attempt by two House Members to win the same post, the 17th District of Pennsylvania was filled with money.
The recently overturned suburban district of Pittsburgh has included Democrat Conor Lamba, a member of the House of Representatives, who won his seat in a special election last spring in another district.
Lambs competed with another member of the House of Representatives, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania.
Maps shattered when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that in violation of the Constitution, the old county had been falsified in favor of the Republicans.
During the March elections in the new 17th district, the financial institutions of the main parties – the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DKKK) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRKK) – were shocked by the campaign’s funding.
Lambs, in Pennsylvania, was voiced when a small reassessment of votes in the 18th congressional district won the widely watched special elections in March.
For more than a decade, Republicans have taken this position, and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the district.
However, politicians have given Democrats such an advantage.
The U.S. is considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but after its overthrow
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, but have basically not responded negatively by Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and, until the partners landed the Trump Organization leadership, had a hotel in the country.
“Recently, officials of the Taiwan State Department decided to remove the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama,” he said in a statement released earlier this month.
But sanctions are under consideration only for El Salvador, which received US aid worth approximately <0x24>140 million in 2017, as well as drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including a reduction in financial assistance and visa restrictions for specific persons, would have been painful for a country in Central America with a high level of unemployment and murder.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity. It was to take place after a similar meeting last year, which was considered an important step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, the top administration officials clearly indicated that they wanted the conference to take place, and thus basically ended any discussions on the sanctions against Salvador.
"In order to show the importance of the administration to this meeting, Vice President Mike Pence is now on the list of speakers of the conference scheduled for mid-October," the diplomats said.
And three American envoys returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without reporting any orders or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were reported by three American officials, including two diplomats, and agreed to discuss internal discussions only if their anonymity is maintained.
Their narratives are confirmed by an analyst close to the administration to remove, as well as speaking, if its anonymity is preserved.
Learn the history.
We can inevitably wait for Robert Mueller’s report on a possible obstruction of Trump’s legitimacy – his very strong evidence is now available in the public archives.
In addition, Mueller is said to have asked his investigation whether the Trump campaign was not conducted in secret in cooperation with our elections hurting Russia.
If Congress moves to the other side, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution – at the same time as he is preparing to stand again before voters, and perhaps finally before the governors’ commission.
There’s a lot of “if” here, and I’m not saying that Trump’s end is inevitable – just like his counterparts in Europe.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will determine whether the fight will continue for a long time.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler – they only needed the West to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We got married and missed the opportunity to prevent the slaughterhouses that lasted for several years.
History revolves around such essential turning points – then the unforgettable march of democracy is accelerated or halted.
Now the Americans have come to a number of such crucial turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the fate of Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein’s concerns began when the newspaper reported that last year an official had offered to secretly register the president and considered his inadequacy to take on these positions.
Rosenstein says the story of The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the new FTB investigation by Bretto Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or incorrect, or if, despite alleged sexual abuse and false evidence, this candidate is appointed to the Supreme Court?
And finally, will we vote for Congress in mid-term elections, which will force Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will be at risk for a long winter.
But because of the lessons I learned in Prague, I believe that we will keep them.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew and was taken to Osvenczym by the same Nazi regime, once located in the house where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and after 60 years I was sent to light a sabotage candle on a table with a swastika.
When I have such a vestige, how could I look to our future in a non-optimistic way?”

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers clash with Rapid Vienna awaits optimistic
On Thursday, the Rangers will accept Rapid Vienna knowing that if they win against Villardreal in Spain earlier this month, they could be in a strong position to leave the G-group.
Due to the road injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was only able to appear for the first time this season in a 2–2 draw with Villarreal. But he hopes that the Rangers can use this result as a trampoline towards more important goals.
“This result was good for us because Villardreal is a great team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We started playing with the belief that we would achieve something, and we ended up with that.
Maybe we could have been more focused at the end, but overall the competition was not bad.
They probably played better in the first ascent, and we met in the second and proved that we are a better team.
There will be another important European League night on Thursday.
I hope we will be able to get three points. The game will be difficult because their result in the last races was great. But I have no doubt that with the support of the spectators we can jump forward and achieve a good result.
Last year was really hard – and what happened to my traumas and changes at the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; the training is great.
I hope that we can now move forward, forget the past season, and play successfully."
This fear of pension savings causes women to lose weight
While the interviewees clearly imagined what kind of care they would like to receive, few spoke to family members about it.
Approximately half of the Nationwide survey respondents said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with children.
“People want to be taken care of by a family member, but don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not announce your wishes in advance, you will not be ready to take care of your family.
Discuss with the counselor and family where and what kind of care you would like to receive, as these factors may be important in predicting costs.
Call a financial advisor. The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
With long-term care, you can decide to pay for these costs by means of a traditional long-term care insurance certificate, a mixed cash-value life insurance certificate, or by insuring your property as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents. Prevent legal disputes by means of protective documents.
Appoint a reliable person who will take care of your medical care and make sure that professionals will fulfill your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the authority to take care of your finances.
You should choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that the bills are paid if you become ineffective.

Earthquake and earthquakes in Indonesia
"At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and quake struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday," officials said in a statement.
As a result of the destroyed communications assistance services, officials were unable to obtain any data from the Dongal regency, north of the Palu sprawling area near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Since then, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Palu.
Here are some of the most important facts about Palu and Dongal on Sulawesi Island.
With a population of about 379,800 in 2017, Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, established at the end of the bay on the narrow western coast of Sulawesi Island.
When the quake struck and struck the jungle, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that stretches along the coast of more than 300 km (180 miles) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
In 2017, there were about 299,200 inhabitants in the regency – beyond the province in the smaller administrative region.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic pillars of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
In the province, nickel mining is also important, indeed, mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past century.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed in the Dongal.
In addition, he struck the western Dongal in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia, which is located on a seismically active Pacific ring of fire, is constantly sparking earthquakes.
Here are some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a violent quake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh caused a tsunami in northern Sumatra that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast – more than half of them Aceh.
In late March and early April 2005, several earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed on Niaso Island near it.
A 6.8-ball earthquake in 2006 struck the southernmost populated island of Java, Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coastline and killed nearly 700 people.
The magnitude 7.6 quake in 2009 struck the area near the western province of Pangong, the capital of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
A 7.5-ball earthquake in 2010 shocked one of the nearby Sumatra islands and caused a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters, which devastated dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
In 2016, the Pidjaya Jaya regency in Aceh was devastated and panicked as people remembered how everything was dismayed after the dreadful 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but the collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, heavy earthquakes struck the island of Lombok, which is visited by Indonesian tourists, and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake has destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists have been temporarily trapped off the coast.
Elder Sarah Palin's son detained on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The Alaska police report on Saturday said Palin, 29, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, harassment of domestic violence and hostility.
As stated in the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the suspected crimes, he picked up the phone from her.
According to the KTUU, Palin was returned to prison at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention facility and released for a <0x24>500 bail.
“On Saturday, he appeared in court, where, asked to justify, he said he was completely innocent,” the network said.
Palin is charged with three A-class violations, which means he could be imprisoned for up to one year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He is also charged with B-Class infringement, a day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently being considered by the Alaska Veterans Court.
The incident is linked to allegations of domestic assault, interference with the reporting of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while in a state of non-violence.
His girlfriend said that he stabbed her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups when she linked her son’s cruel behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and jungle in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed in a tsunami on Friday on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.
The 7.5-ball earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working. The number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, they share videos that show the moment of the tsunami.

Federal prosecutors target suspected in New York City terrorist attack rarely applied the death penalty
In New York, federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people. This is a rare sentence that has not been carried out in this state for federal crimes since 1953.
On October 31, Saipova, aged 30, rented a truck from Home Depot and carried out an attack on bicycles along the western highway in Lower Manhattan, which was driving the road, sheltering pedestrians and cyclists.
As reported in New York City’s southern district on its intention to pursue the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily injuries.
According to a court document, both of these indictments may impeach the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury of Jurors issued a 22-point indictment to Saipov, covering eight counts of murder related to property abuse (usually applied by federal prosecutors to motorized crime cases) and criminal offences.
Prosecutors say the attack was very well planned and pre-conceived, and that the way Saipov carried out it was called ugly, cruel and immoral.
"As a result of the actions of Sayfull Habibullaevius Saipov, members and friends of the following families and loved ones were injured and lost: Diego Enrique Angelino, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake'o, Ariel Erlijo, Hernandez-Hernando-Ferrondo, and Hernando Die.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case in which the death penalty was sought was a decade ago in New York City’s Southern District.
Accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed was in 1953 in a New York federal case against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, when they were sentenced two years ago for plotting to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who was from Uzbekistan, did not regret his actions either immediately after the attack or a few months later.
According to police, he told investigators that he was feeling good about what he had done.
According to the alleged act, Saipov revealed to officials that he was inspired by Islamic State (ISIS) videos he watched on his phone to carry out the attack.
Police said he had also asked the hospital to hang the Islamic State flag in the palace.
He did not acknowledge his guilt under 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of Saipow’s federal-funded defenders, said they were clearly disappointed by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to acknowledge guilt and to be imprisoned for life without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events to all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipovo’s defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Brexit Negotiations Should Be Responsible by Nigel Farage
Today, during a protest at the Tory Conference, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the army of the people.
A former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the heat of Euroskeptics, and one of the party’s MPs, Theresa May, suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the House of Conservatives, told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have resigned if Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
But the difficulties that May faces in trying to unite the divided side of supporters have been unveiled by EU-speaking Tory supporters who joined the city’s separate protest against Brexit.
It is difficult for the prime minister to implement his compromise plan in the Czech Republic when it is attacked by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it should try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostility and force Eurosceptics and the Liberal Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bone’s statement at the “Leave Means Leave” meeting was that he wanted to break Chequers’ plan.
He said Farage had to be an equal partner and that he had to be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had led, we would have already left the EU,” he said.
Wellingboro MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we have to reject the Chequers plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “In world wars, we fought not to obey others.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Bone denies the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The belief that the British people have rethinked and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Andrea Yenkyns, a Brexit supporter, also participated in the demonstrations and told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular among our party members and activists who go to the streets and, most importantly, vote for us.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a critical statement, May added: “The prime ministers will keep their posts when they keep their promises.”
Farage said that the meeting politicians should be forced to feel the heat if they make a decision by referendum in 2016.
“Now it’s a matter of our confidence, of our people and of our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to deliver Brexit, so today we’re here to tell them we’re not going to let go of it.”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who almost betrayed Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the army of this nation that has brought us the victory of Brexit, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud of the United Kingdom."
Opponents of Brexit marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group was formed this weekend, a group of activists marched with posters "Tories against Brexit".
Worker Lord Adonis has accused the Conservative of the security issues they had experienced with the party's application at the start of the conference.
“These are people who say they can install IT systems and all the technologies necessary for the option of Canada plus plus, for wall-free and free trade without borders with Ireland,” he said.
“This is a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider participating in the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider whether to participate in the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with the public in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is constantly criticizing President Donald Trump, is participating in the November re-election, in which he will meet with GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, one of the leaders of the 2016 Trump campaign Massachusetts.
It was suspected that she would meet with Trump in 2020.
Since Trump became president, the Saturday afternoon event in Hollywood has been her 36 meeting with voters using a public meeting format.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to participate in the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix the collapsed government, and that women should lead it.
Arrested suspect in LSU Sims shooting case
Louisiana city of Baton Rouge police said on Saturday that they had arrested the suspect, who was accused of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department reported that Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, was arrested.
Police released a video of Friday's shooting and asked to help identify the man seen in it.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and died near the University of the South on Friday.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul reported on Saturday that Wayde’s Sims was shot in the head and died of injuries.
Wayde stood to defend his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interviewed and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, holding a gun, and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained unresolved and was confined to the East Baton Rouge District Police Department.
The 198-cm-high pre-last course student Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of which started on Friday, spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the pitch, earned 5.6 points, and scored 2.9 points.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship title when the team ordered him to give a victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas defeated Lewis Hamilton in the qualifying race on Saturday, it became immediately clear that the directions of the Mercedes team in the race will be extremely important.
After starting the race from the first place, Bottas made a great start and, turning his position on the first two laps, almost left Hamilton in trouble, encouraging Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the first two-hole garage, left Hamilton and he returned to the races in the group's queue, so it was decisive.
Mercedes slammed into a two-door garage after the wheel and returned to the track after Vettel, but after almost unfinished contact, Hamilton exploded forward when the Ferrari driver after a double maneuver, to keep the position in the third position.
Max Verstappen, who was celebrating his 21st birthday, started at the end of the race, but at the end of the first round he was already seventh.
He was the fastest part of the race because he drove without changing tyres to make the finish as quick as possible, bend Kimi Raikkonen and finish fourth.
In the end, he entered the two-hole garage in 44 rounds, but in the remaining eight rounds he was unable to increase the pace and Raikkonen crossed the finish line fourth.
“It was a tough day for Walter because he had been following him perfectly all weekend, and when I was asked to leave, he acted like a real gentleman.
"The team played well and scored the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump accused Senator Dianne Feinstein of persistently denying Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh was accused of sexual harassment during a meeting on Saturday.
Speaking in West Virginia, the president did not directly name Ford's statements to the Senate Law Committee, but said that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are impolite, incompetent and unjust.
“What could have happened and actually happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people being angry, unkind, unkind, and unjust,” he said.
“When you see the official statements and the leaks, and then you say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you mad?
Do you remember her answer to the question, did she leak the document? “Oh, oh, what?
Really not.
I didn't run."
Well, wait a minute.
“We don’t, we don’t,” he said, representing the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, which was released earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been withdrawn from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee: “I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations and I didn’t reveal its history.”
“She asked to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the president apparently did not agree with her denial, and during a meeting with the people on Saturday night, he said, "You know, it was really bad body language.
She may not have fainted, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In further prosecuting the candidate for Supreme Court judge, who was accused of illegal sexual conduct by three women, the president claimed that the Democrats used the charges to their advantage.
“They are committed to regaining power by any means necessary.
“You see recklessness, recklessness; they don’t care what they hurt or what they have to pass in order to gain power and control,” the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer wins two matches with Dandi club "Giants"
The Dundee Stars beat the Belfast Giants for Friday's loss in the Elite League and won Saturday's Dani matches with a score of 5:3.
The Giants were early in the game when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauviller won two innings.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie's score was flattened before Dwyer again pushed the Giants forward.
Francois Bouchard from the Dandi team scored the result, but later secured the victory for two of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen's innings.
Adam Keefe's men suffered their third loss this season in the Elite League, before being swayed by Belfast on Friday night and defeating Dandi club by 2-1.
This was the fourth team meeting this season, and the previous three games were won by the Giants.
Dwyer scored the first innings in the fourth minute (3,35) after Kendall McFaull's transfer, and after four more minutes, Beauviller doubled overweight after David Rutherford's transfer.
In the hard-earned matches, Sullivan returned the hosts to the arena with a score of 13:10, and after Matto Marquardt's handover, he scored 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants went out for the first break at the front, and at the end of the first raise he earned his second night innings.
With a quantitative oversight, the square’s hosts overshadowed and Bouchard scored again at 27:37.
Cownie's and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen for the first time in the match for the Dandi team to move forward at the end of the second pick, and secured the victory by winning the team's fifth pick in the middle of the last pick.
The Giants, who have already lost their last four games out of five, will meet Milton Keynes at home next Friday.
Flight Manager Killed to Help Hundreds of Passengers Escape Earthquake
Indonesia's flight guide was declared a hero when he was killed by helping a plane with several hundred passengers safely get into the air.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are believed to have disappeared since Friday’s severe earthquake that ravaged Sulawesi Island, amid the tsunami.
The site continued to be plagued by strong repeated underground strikes and many people trapped in the ruins of Palu city.
While his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the heavily volatile control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained in his workplace to help the 6321 Batik Air aircraft that had to fly safely on the flight, which was already on the take-off taco at the time.
Then, thinking that the flight control tower was crashing down, he jumped out of it.
He later died in the hospital.
According to ABC News, Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Siraitas said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We took him by helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, the helicopter hasn't reached Paul yet.
“It’s an infinitely painful news for us,” he added.
The government is concerned that the death toll could rise to thousands, as the country’s disaster mitigation agency reports that the cities of Dangala, Sigis and Boutong are difficult to reach.
"I think the death toll will continue to rise, as many victims are still under wreckage and we cannot reach them," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
A six-meter-high wave destroyed the city of Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies of supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, high-speed cars come to the victims.
Lack of clean water.
Theft of self-service shops everywhere . "
Janis Gelfand, the head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: “Indonesia’s Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse.”
Indonesian President Jokas Widodas arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
“Are you ready?” she told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was devastated by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Newgine says a plane crash in Micronesia: Air Newgine now claims that one man has been missing after crashing into the lagoon
The flight, which ended in an airplane crash in the Pacific lagoon belonging to Micronesia, airliners now say that one person is missing, although previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members had been rescued from a hunger strike.
Air Newgine said she had no knowledge of a single passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in search of the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests to provide more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuku Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what was the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing point.
Some witnesses of the incident believe that the plane did not apply to landing on the landing taco.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had fallen from a very low altitude.
“It was very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to get off the plane until the emergency exits.
He said the flight's satellites were panicked and screamed, and he himself suffered a slight head trauma.
The U.S. Navy said its sailors had also helped rescue people who were being shipwrecked to shore before the plane crashed to a depth of about 30 meters after repairing the nearby landing.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have been killed in the accidents of airline aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them belonged to Air Newgini.
Analyst sets out the sequence of events on the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office reported on Saturday the case of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as a court expert on intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to merge the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the nineteen-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movement on the night of death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chamber on the night of her death, which contradicts earlier statements.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to be with a friend Michael Sanford, police went to interrogate Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and testified that he was not in his city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth, stating that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he "wasted because his truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks after he died.
The cell phone records show that they met each other a week ago.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and addressee information from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
It is expected that the defence of its final arguments will begin teaching on Sunday.
The judge said that the case would be handed over to the jurors later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is a Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative attitude towards this genre by spreading positive messages to their music.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hip hop originated from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to go back to the sources of hip hop and popularize conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently reborn the UK in the works of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York girl has been brought to court after she was fired because of a “racist” message
A New York girl has filed a couple for dismissal from work for discrimination after receiving a wrong-addressed message from a mother complaining that she is “one more black”.
The couple denies existing racists and called the lawsuit "violation".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked to learn that Giselle Maurice, the new babysitter, was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEE, DAR ONE JUDGE,” Mr. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a letter to her husband.
But she was sent twice, not to her husband, but to Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, understood by Plasco-Flaxman’s reckless actions felt uncomfortable and dismissed Mr. Maurice, claiming that the former daughter, who was an African-American, had done her job poorly and hoped to get a Filipina instead.
Maurice was paid for one working day and she was sent home by Uber car.
Maurice has now brought the couple to court to claim compensation for the pardon and seeks to earn as much as <0x24>350 a day for half a year’s life and work at the client’s home, for which she was initially hired although without a contract.
“I want to show them that things like that can’t be done,” she told Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple resigned on charges of racism denying it and saying it was wise to fire Maurice because they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after she was insulted.
“My wife sent her what she didn’t want to say.
She is not a racist.
We’re not racists,” said Postman Joel Plascas.
“Would you trust your children to someone you didn’t ask for, even if that was a mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think."
After comparing the lawsuit to the “violation,” Plascas said that the wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation”.
Are you going to judge for this?
This is not a very nice behavior,” added an investment banking specialist.
While the court case is being tried, the media has accused a couple of social media criticizing their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers are afraid readers will not understand a speaking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s sad to be somewhere else reading the book for the first time until it was released.
Now it is very interesting to know what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before discovering the inspiration to write a book for children about a teddy bear, would not have been too disappointed if his work had been rejected, she added that it was the 60th anniversary of the book's release and the anniversary of its death.
Speaking of Paddington, which she describes as "a very important family member", she added that the father was silently proud of his success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and didn’t like to drink,” she said.
“Because Paddington was so similar to himself, he felt like having a child who achieved something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your job.
I think he also valued Paddington’s success story.
Although it was his work and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave merit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was unforgettable and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When her daughter was released, she was rushed to Nicos Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors failed to save her life.
"Nada has been calling and saying that the situation is really bad, it's not expected to survive," Mr. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nado who called to tell her that she had two minutes left to live and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I said to her, “Tashi, dear, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Physicians gave medicines that kept her heartbeat, slowly ceased to work and removed from the body.
She died a little early, and it was the end of it all.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn’t mask, scream or cry because I was in an environment, surrounded by families and people.
I should have kept it for myself.”
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, now in the fall of his deceased daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who did not realize the difficult test she had to overcome.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“My head was lowered and I was crying all the time.
It’s hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt a great regret for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women's Openings to Prevent Suicide on Bridges
Two women, who have lost their loved ones, try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh Bridge distribute open-minded messages and inspiring phone numbers that people can call and ask for help.
P. Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want a single parent to feel the way I have to feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old woman, Davis, said that her son was a very promising boss, distinguished by a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated the room.
But he did work before he died, because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his suicide brother.
Mr Davis said, “I’m constantly afraid that a chain reaction may occur.”
Mr. Davis created an open mind, “that people would know that there are people in the environment who can be contacted and spoken to, even if it is a friend.
“Don’t sit still, you have to talk.”
Mr. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mr. Davies, lost his 15-year-old partner Mark, who retired shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, surrounded by depression, and nobody complained,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his attitude.
“During Christmas, the situation was quite bad: when the kids took out their gifts, he didn’t look them in the eyes and didn’t react in any way.”
She said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: “In the family, it left emptiness.
It drowns our heart.
But we all have to continue to fight.”

After the FTB investigation started, Bretto Kavanaugh’s future stuck on his hair
I thought if we could actually get something he asked for — a limited length and scope study — maybe we could bring a little bit of unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee was “in the strongholds.”
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FTB to open an investigation?
Their opposition is determined only by time.
Until the midterm elections, which will take place on 6 November, there are only five weeks left and, if Republicans are expected to appear poor, their efforts to elect the desired person to the country’s highest court will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators in an effort to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bushui in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, former Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FTB submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh in the Senate could get 50 votes to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break up and approve him in the Supreme Court.
When Kim came to power, North Korea’s number of deserters “diminished”
South Korea's lawmakers said the number of North Korean deserters to South Korea had declined after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said 1,127 deserters were identified last year, compared to 2,706 deserters in 2011.
Park said the main factors were tightened control of the North Korean and Chinese borders and increased prices of human smuggling.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Many North Korean deserters are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks on nuclear weapons.
This took place after the historic US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore in June, when they both essentially agreed to aim for the Korean peninsula to become a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not changing its sanctions since then.
“If there is no trust in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances, we will not be the first to unilaterally arm the United Nations,” he said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi deduces Bretta Kavanaugh to be "scientific" and claims he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh a "scientific" and said he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court due to her temperament.
Pelosi made these remarks in an interview he gave Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
“I just can’t imagine that if a woman did that, she would be said to be hysterical,” Pelosi said in a statement to the Senate Courts Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, when he talked about family and high school times, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes unprecedented to yell, or unflinching.
He also totally condemned former democrats in the committee, who accused him of "grotesque and coordinated destruction of reputation", which was not organized by liberals, angry at Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's evidence proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he had revealed his side's view of Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself from his statements and the Clinton and Democratic Party attack,” she said.
Asked whether he would seek to remove Mr Kavanaugh if his candidacy was approved and the majority of votes received by Democrats in the House of Representatives, Mr Pelosi objected.
“I will say that if he lies to Congress or the FTB, it is not appropriate to take office not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is currently working in,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Mr. Kavanaugh is a judge of the District Court of Columbia.
Mr Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Mr Kavanaugh on the Accessibility Health Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During the approval hearings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be revoked.
“Now is not the time for us to say, hysterically, by side, after becoming a judge, ‘How wonderful!’” said Pelosi.
The Power Women Should Use <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
It’s a legitimate criticism – the end of months and even years of agony, which she can’t utter without tears.
“When we cry, we cry,” Mrs. Steinem told me after 45 years.
“That doesn’t seem unusual to me, does it?”
She continued: “I was greatly helped by one woman, the head of a company, who told me that she was also crying when she was upset, but developed a certain method: when she was upset and started crying, she said to the man she was talking to at the time, “You may not seem to be crying to me.
Actually, I’m angry.”
And she just continued to cry.
It looked brilliant to me.”
Tears are considered an acceptable expression of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is from one of the first jobs in the office, where mostly men worked and where I once started to cry about the inexpressible fury. Then I was approached by an older woman, a stabbed by a leader, who always slipped a little bit, and stretched into the ladder.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said.
They don’t know you’re insane.
They think you’re sad, so they’ll be happy to beat you.”
Democratic congresswoman Patricia Schroeder from Colorado worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a foreign ship Monkey Business (aphorism, meaning easy time) and withdrew his candidacy, Mr. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why the candidates could not apply.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing after 30 years.
There were seven other candidates at the time, so I didn’t really need another one.
Someone called me "Snowflakes with Seven Snakes."
Late in the campaign, there was little time left to raise funds, so she sworn in a non-publishing nomination until she raised <0x24>2 million.
It was an unequal fight.
She noted that some sponsors, who sacrificed <0x24>1,000 to men, gave her only <0x24>250.
“Did they think I was getting a discount?” she asked.
Speaking in a speech in which she announced that she was launching a formal campaign, it was so encompassed by emotions – thanks to people who were depressed, a system of disappointment that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and directly reach voters, not representatives, and anger over sexism.
“You should have noticed that I was getting nervous,” Schroeder recalled in a press response to her speech.
“You would have thought that I was supported by the Cleenex towel business.
I remember thinking what would be written on my grave's memory.
“She was crying?”
What the U.S.-China trade generation can do for Beijing
The first U.S.-China trade war was created, and while the battle has not yet ended well, experts say, the lack of peace may in the long run be beneficial to Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by taxing China’s main exports, including solar elements, steel and aluminum.
The sharpest confrontation took place this week when new tariffs came into effect on goods worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), meaning that China will substantially tax half of the goods exported to the United States.
Beijing responded to all the measures in the same way, with the latest decision imposing between five and ten percent tariffs on U.S. goods with a total value of <0x24>60 billion.
China has sworn to fight the U.S. tooth-for-tooth, and it seems that this world’s second-largest market does not really intend to land in the near future.
Washington’s sanctions would only be softened if China adhered to the demands, but the US publicly dismissal would be too lazy for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing properly breaks its party, the difficulties of the trade war with the United States can have a positive impact on China in the long run, as it will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
“The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would put the economies of both countries at risk is actually far more dangerous than observers have acknowledged so far,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Asia Center for New America.
Syria’s Foreign Minister Says Residents Are Ready to Accept Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks assistance in restoring a country that has been devastated by the war for more than 7 years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“As a result of progress in combating terrorism, the situation in the region has become much more stable and secure,” he said.
The government is continuing its efforts to restore the devastated sites of terrorists and to restore the normal situation.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions aimed at everyday life and well-being have already been established.
The United Nations estimates that since the beginning of the war, Syria has left about 5.5 million Syrians.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in restoring the devastated country.
However, he also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe defeats Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team, who defeated the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5:10.5, won the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National near Paris (France).
The U.S. has lost for the sixth time in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in this continent since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, enough to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had been followed hard throughout the tournament, kicked off the kick from the starting pitch straight into the water in a 16-minute 3-day match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian player F. Molinari gained all rounds and became one of four players who scored 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament gained its current form.
American Jordan Spieth 5:4 was defeated by the lowest-ranked European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world’s top-ranked Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to England’s Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Eight-time Ryder Tournament veteran Sergio García has become the most successful European player of the tournament with a career score of 25.5.
“I rarely cry, but I can’t handle it today.
It was an easy year.
I am very grateful to Mr Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that we got the cup back.
It all depends on the team and I’m happy to be able to help,” said Garcia after the European victory.
He is handing over the squad to his native John Ram, who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in Sunday's 2-1 unit game.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, winning the 14 biggest prizes and dropping only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed to hit the driving slope over the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high-level game throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Fury said after the disappointing performance of the team: “I’m proud of these men, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we started pushing the Europeans.
We walked.
I'm heading for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will falsify with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their captain.
You have to lower your head.
Our opponents were more prolific."
