Politicians in Wales are afraid to "like fools"
There was horror among certain members of the Welsh National Assembly over a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It was created due to plans to change the name of the assembly to Welsh Parliament (the Welsh Parliament).
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could lead to ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned because "it rimes on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means shit.
A member of the party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal leap from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on nominations that Members of Parliament will receive, of course, is up to the Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, in which there was broad support for calling the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option was most supported in a public consultation.
The AMs seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach an agreement may prove difficult for the House president, Elin Jones, who is expected to draft a bill on the amendments within a few weeks.
The bill on the reforms contains other amendments to the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs will receive the final vote on what they will be called when the bill is debated.
Macedonians hold vote on change of country name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that their northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim on Greece's territory and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says he will undermine the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's will be silent as the churches of Harlem fight
“The older people I’ve talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
"Today there is none of the parts."
He said it was understandable that the bars were disappearing.
“People are socializing in other ways nowadays,” he said.
"Bars no longer constitute the neighborhood's daily living rooms, where people enter on a daily basis."
Regarding churches, he is concerned that the money raised to sell assets does not last long, and that they “are back sooner or later where they started.”
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people that don't help the neighborhood's recurring tents.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white,” he says, “and it breathes further into the development where these churches eventually shut down completely because it is unlikely that most people who move into condominiums will become members of the churches.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist group moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who was at the forefront of a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of Harlem's primary shopping streets, who would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to restore the building, they ordered the clockwork.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the clock game "the poor's clocks".
The expert, who played on the clock game in June, called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first clock game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's couldn't find a replacement for him.
What has taken place in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were acquired by the church leaders, others by the diocese.
In July, the Council of the Congregation – the principal body of the parish, consisting of leading parishioners – wrote to the diocese about concerns that the diocese “would try to push the expenses forward” to the parish council, even though the parish council had not been involved in hiring the architects and enterpreneurs as bishops.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old shark injured on diving trip after hummers in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he plunged after hummers in California on the first day of the hummer season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dive with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy cry for help and then along with a group padded over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that he thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a hummer, but then realized that the boy shouted, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
"The whole necklace was ripped up," Hammel said, seeing when he came to the boy.
"I cried out to everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flew to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported in critical condition.
It is unclear which species of shark was attacked.
Larry Giles, the author of the book, said in a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the route from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security reasons and to carry out investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with a range of beauty products with special assistants in the style of big magazines.
As part of a major effort to occupy the UK’s beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and residential products are falling. The larger ranges of beauty products are tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in several stores next year, if they remain successful.
The investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets look for new products for shelves that were previously used for television, microwave ovens and residential products.
Sainsbury's says they are doubling their range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are introduced for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges also get more space with branded areas in style with those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches the range of boutique makeup, so most of the products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop is testing stores in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in the south of London last week, and the second opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and an evolution towards buying small amounts of food daily from local shoppers means that supermarkets have to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, said the stores will look like big stores, as the supermarket chain takes on the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of groceries and have made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to update the beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00s, but the collaboration ended with a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We have changed the look and decoration of our beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the immersive environment and convenient location means that we are now a compelling destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'shooting' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
Dragons' The Star Peter Jones left behind "screaming", after TV host Holly Willoughby resigned from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home product and accessories brand True.
The company had been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons’ star Peter Jones angry after retiring from their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "crazy" when the popular TV woman during a tense meeting on Tuesday in his headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she no longer had enough time for their home products and accessories.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was tiped to double Willoughby’s estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she had left Truly while Jones flew out of the UK to one of her vacation homes.
A source said, “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she was going to deal with over the next few decades.
Her decision to retire surprised all the people involved.
No one wanted to believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in the headquarters of Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the announcement from This Morning host, one of the UK’s top earning stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in products – ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and housing products – and the potential for further delays in launching.
It could also be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and housekeeper Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded True together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couple take a vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is expected to be the M&S brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business actions."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that "is not worthy of a president" and for being so positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his parody at a news conference.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in a meeting more after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear crackdown.
But the negotiations on nuclear decommissioning have gone on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “similar reaction” from the United States to North Korea’s initial action against disarmament.
He noted that instead, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump took a more optimistic view of the speech at his electorate.
“North Korea is doing very well,” he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.”
He said his attempts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results — the completion of missile tests, aid in the release of hostages, and the return of Earthly remains from U.S. military personnel.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this tightly packed arena, we’d have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Raises Island and Kills Hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok’s population was homeless, the state of national disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for national disaster preparedness, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to emergency relief efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunami is missing and this has probably affected the death toll.
Even under the best conditions it is challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been located in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia’s lack of infrastructure a central point in his campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by the lack of funding in the course of the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko also experiences pressure from the underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken on a more conservative form of belief.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with maquettes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge last minute off against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a handout from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind by 1-0.
He punched the ball with his left foot before making a high shot at the farthest pole.
The ball flew high over the field towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was all about getting in the position to get in the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and I made a single touch. I didn't think much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 by the midfielder, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker handed the heel back to Mateo Kovacic before setting the pace on the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half-field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the midfield.
He then made a long episode that brought Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and ended towards the farthest pole with a shot with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group game at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton at UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster preparedness early Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the brick walls from buildings that fell after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the judge scale, hit Friday and created waves up to 6 meters high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by walls from collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder, After Woman Killed
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area, who saw or heard something, to move forward.
Police Assistant Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would like to urge everyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have recorded something with the dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that may be crucial for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived on the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his apartment, but is told by the police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was stunned when he heard what had happened.
The residents are told that it will take several hours for them to come back.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now considered a scene of the crime.
A crying woman arrives.
She keeps repeating, “It’s so terrible.”
At 4 p.m., there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another car just outside.
A number of police officers were inside the detention and monitored the apartment complex.
Anyone with information please write a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and provide log 247 on September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes the last memorial to be struck by discussion of "rewriting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts that were carried out by his fanatic, puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposals as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace at Westminster would become a goal.
The image storm during the English Civil Wars was neither commanded nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his grandfather Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s stunning portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century attitudes and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worth praising.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate picture is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is absolutely certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of praise and memory."
Dr<0xC3><0xA6>bergris invades and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only under his nickname "Yuan", was found dead with an overheated heartbeat and smeared in blood near a grocery store in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give pig injections with vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He allegedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the coffin next to him was open.
He said there was a large horn with blood in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and wounded," the cousin, who goes under the nickname "Wu", said in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Records from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rarities, but there have been previously cases where pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig massed a Welsh farmer against his tractor, until his wife frightened the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just jokes.
Those naps, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to give heavy rain in much of the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves over the cooler waters on Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will provide heavy rain with flooding in northern Mexico and southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had won at 38 m/s, a Category 1 hurricane, at 10 a.m. on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure outlet is forming across the Pacific Ocean, moving east to the US west coast. As Rosa approaches the Peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the coming low-pressure outlet, creating heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create hazardous storm floods, floating precipitation and possibly landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain up to 51 to 101 mm in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high likelihood of storm floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out in the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn cliffs into bubbling rivers and thunder will create powerful local winds and create dust blows.<0x3C>/sec>
The approaching low-pressure outlet will give heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of over 13 mm, which can cause smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region during its rainy season.
Spreading tropical rainfall will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be major temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic gets cooler, but it remains fairly hot in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through central United States Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern regions.
There could be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate outlook indicates that there is a high likelihood of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million watched Thursday’s gripping testimony from nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that interrupted regular programs to tell about Friday's late development: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, which allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the prosecutors.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was intoxicated with her and tried to take her clothes off for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotionally charged witness statement that he is 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw it on Friday.
The company recorded average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available viewers from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people view programs in offices.
To put it into perspective, it’s a spectator number equivalent to a match during the NFL playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-driven hosts have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was arrested for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, as protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the hearing in the jury.
He stood with a downward glance for several minutes as he was shaken out, and CNN broadcast live.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and said before the elevator shut down that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television stations covered live a few hours later, when the jury committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would proceed to a vote for the whole Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote for it under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the prosecutors against the nominee in the following week, which the Democrats, who are in the Senate, had demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with the Coons and a number of senators subsequently, Flake took his decision.
Flake's choice had an influence because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the survey.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister Accuses Critics of 'Doing Politics' With Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU for "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside that of Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson presented her attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan and said that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's tariffs was "totally ridiculous".
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected to Be Behind LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect for shooting Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of negligent manslaughter, police said in Baton Rouge.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpsons, and police said the Sims lost their glasses during the match.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, CBS subsidiary WAFB reported.
After Simpson was interrogated, police said he had confessed to Wayde's shooting.
His bail is set at <0x24>350,000, the lawyer reports.
The forensic doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot that went from head to neck.
The police department says a task force from the Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, the Southern University police and citizens in the area have assisted with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports manager Joe Alleva thanked police in the area for their "care and chase for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"It's the kind of thing you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Vulcan spyer ash over Mexico City
Ash, spiked from the Popocatepetl volcano, has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater, and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitored the space and shakes over several rounds.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on roads in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the judge scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrators seeking independence collided with rioters as thousands took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized vote on independence.
A group of masked separatists held back tycoons, threw away and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also battles later on the day the police used their spells to keep the fights down.
For several hours, independence groups shouted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven" and were met with unionist protesters who shouted "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
A year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the atmosphere remains tense in the region.
Voters voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence, but the voter turnout was low, and those who opposed the secession boycotted the vote in a large way.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote during violent clashes at polling stations throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dared to hope that Catalonia could achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying with joy that they had the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although they were given a narrow but important victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved into exile or are sitting in detention and awaiting judgment for their role in the holding of the non-selection and the vote.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on her phone in support of the police and said the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
“There is going to be more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been awaiting his trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"The election as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to take a stand against the backlash in democratic values and the undermining we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
It was also possible that an armrest was fired against the car at some point.
Menga Shot Gives Livingston 1-0 Victory Over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston's supporters overtook the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 games as manager for the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team stepped side-by-side with Hibernian in second place.
The Gerrards team have not won the league this season and are scheduled to meet the leading Hearts team, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Rangers will be visiting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, in turn, is expanding their unbeaten streaks to six games, and head coach Holt has still not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances of cash withdrawal
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, and their direct playing style created big problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across ahead of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the goal, after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's crosshead in front of the goal.
The home team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give the team problems in death-ball situations.
And it was in those circumstances that the important goal came.
The Rangers made a free kick, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the setup for Menge, who made a touch and scored from the center of the field.
At the time, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball, but struggled to get through the defense of the home team, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was virtually unchallenged.
The pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos received a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was shot with the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's death ball situations.
Continuous deliveries entered Livingston's field, but were avoided, and two demands for a penalty kick – after Halkett's tackle on substitute Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Phenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played amazingly and exceeded the expectations of their upward journey.
Their style of play and team have remained largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but much of the honour has to go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he joined.
There were many heroes.
Leading Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Mengea held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
Rangers lacked dog inspiration.
They have been really good at times under Gerrard, but they played below level.
Their endings lacked sharpness – they only got the home team naked once – and that’s a steep wake-up for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
Differences have arisen in areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police held for security reasons a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but lots of supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents – many of them Kurdish – also remarked and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero by some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat by others.
Accident on the road in Deptford: Cyclist dies in car collision
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwestern part of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were rescuers on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver escaped from the site, on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working on identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been changed, and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six police officers injured in riots
Six prison officers have been injured in riots in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There were riots in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST on Sunday, and the riots are still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers have been picked up to handle the riots, involving eight detainees and taking place in one wing of the prison.
Police were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison employees are deployed to deal with the ongoing unrest in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clarified that those responsible are reported to the police and can end up spending longer time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 detainees, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, unarmed officers were summoned to prison for dealing with serious unrest, where staff were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storms (drier areas may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical low pressure strikes Arizona, but it is most likely at the beginning of next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape in the southwestern United States and create a risk of storm flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued storm warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones had retained status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated volumes up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas in the southwestern desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those without the risk of storm flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Floods are a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will be useful because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.<0x3C>/sec>
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category,” reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to strike land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum wind strength of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore falls in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rains over parts of Mexico can become heavy and pose a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or its remains is very heavy rain in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the United States," the National Hurricane Center reported.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storm floods and floating precipitation in deserts as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Murder Attempt
Three teenage detainees and a 20-year-old man are arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stitches in Somerset.
The teenage wreckage was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 p.m. BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
Police have called on anyone who may have mobile records of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was in favor of the Democratic Party's "wrongness and anger"
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's ruthless and reckless tactics," Trump said at a voter's summit in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been subjected to "the evil, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly denied and emotionally charged accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice of confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that confirms one of the most skilled legal brains of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service,” he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republicans attending the polls in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our life is.
You can’t vote for me, but you’re actually voting for me,” he said.
"That's why I travel around and fight for amazing candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "fight and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a high-ranking person in the Republican party told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll increases
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were rinsed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the coast at dusk, sucking many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still running on the beach. They did not run immediately and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
More people survived by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster preparedness agency has published air photographs showing many demolished buildings and shops, corrupted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Resurrections continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Board (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated during Friday’s major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb threw over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, the board said.
Nugroho described the injuries as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found trapped under the bridges of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and that 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and injuries could be greater along the 300-kilometre-long coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area closer to the earthquake’s epicenter.
The communication "was completely lame without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” they said.
The board was criticized on Saturday by many fronts for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building, desperately screaming warnings about the tsuvami coming closer, to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that dissipated communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo aircraft with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but there is still a strong need for food and basic necessities among the evacuated.
The city’s airport has been reopened, but only for auxiliary work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have safely arrived in Palu city, where employees seek shelter under presents set up in the yard by their account. They came across areas with extensive destruction on the road, Doseba said.
"They told me that they destroyed so many houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid organizations began the hard work of re-establishing aid work, complaints came about that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and staff from abroad must only enter if the area where the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘OK, it’s a national disaster,’ we can open up for international assistance, but there is no status yet.”
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people were holding back in hopes that their loved ones would be the miracles that illuminate the dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under brick cracks for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders at the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
“As a paragliding veteran, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circle, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants of Palu, who were part of the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted in only one gray fly bone instead of two blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he says.
Tyve takes <0x24>26,750 while fulfilling ATM in Newport on the Levee
Twenty people stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's employee who was fulfilling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a press release from police in Newport.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Criminal Assistant Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "on the back of Brink's staff" and stole a bag that was supposed to have been delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the site, according to the press release, but the police did not state how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the identity of the thieves, please contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, in which he wrote: "The weapon formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place prior to his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces songs Ariana Grande on the show, which was cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist's name, but West has previously said that the name has a religious significance to him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, meaning the only one, to only Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad, and confused sides, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former partners, JAY-Z, has also switched between small and large letters and changed whether the binding line is included.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches its 50th anniversary for a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "never would ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
Troopers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on 2 October 1968 and killed up to 300 at a time when leftist student movements ravaged many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pulling young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. Should Double the Financing of Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI user who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have made statements about artificial intelligence, but the U.S. still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced its plan last year and aims to take the first place in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind compared to the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
doubling the budget could double the chances of achieving the next major performance in artificial intelligence in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google's China department.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to achieve legacy from the government, Lee says.
“It’s not China that’s squeezing the academic leaders, it’s the big companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically have offered work permits.
The Chinese government issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations’ allocation of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center to involve industry and research partners, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation trying to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has remained silent for months.
Macedonians hold vote on change of country name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would solve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighboring country to the north constitutes a claim to Greek territory, and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has applied for membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s primarily Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the electorate will make up the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying for creating access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means more secure lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the vote and make it valid.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities were reported at 13:00.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters voting.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the Macedonian vote on a change of name, which would open up for membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we will achieve membership with a raised front, not at the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn against others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will vote for it because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said a "yes" result would be a "safeguard of our future."
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote – less than the required electoral participation.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the voting rate must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the probe government since it took place in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero fights throughout the Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton Defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score coming after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a performance on the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before swinging out on open run.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought past one defender, and subsequently ran from several on the edge of the Brighton field.
He then made a leftover and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to overlist Brighton goaltender Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League match.
The goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in the sequence ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice episode along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of touches before leading Sterling to the farthest pole.
The Sky Blues forward punched the ball in the net just before it slipped past goals.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will drill the Rockies
The Nationals were eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the cast against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there is still opportunity to participate in the playoffs for the Rockies, who have played a game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies held at least a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still have their first division title for good.
"Although we don't have anything to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver and that the opponents would play at the highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn’t I be excited to play in those circumstances?”
Nationals have not yet announced the startup for Sunday, but will likely put Scherzer as pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the spot for the 34th time, trained his throws on Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is normally his rest day.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds election in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republicans meeting at the polling stations in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our life.
It’s one of the big, big – you can’t vote for me, but you’re actually voting for me, that’s why I travel around and fight for amazing candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all available means. You can see how evil, how disgusting they are.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive against to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, but we won’t give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of "fighting and blocking".
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "peaceful and evil and disgusting and lying."
He referred to the Senate's Supreme Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, which loudly triggered the bow from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you delete the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, oh no, wait -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant to those who express their views.
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
I am only the latest in a number of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome – just because we have made our opinion known.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship charge was to criticize me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems, in which Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
In the invitation to the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it was stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local MEP, Friday evening meetings have been exactly like this.
Today, unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not that, and the promise of a "more friendly, gentler" policy is far back in the past if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed by whether the party leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared political stances began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to – whether it was national security or the EU internal market.
When I say my opinion in public – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – I follow a long line of rough messages on social media that call for the rejection and contradiction of the seeking policy and tell me that I shouldn’t be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments made against me are usually political.
I have a deep respect for the professionalism and combat will of my colleagues, who are daily overwhelmed by sexism or racism, but are still struggling.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
But in reality it is no longer a spacious organization and with every vote of distrust or change of selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the past two years that if I’m putting on myself and not being so loud, I’ll have to “get through it.”
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Since I became a Labour member 32 years ago, when I went to school, I was provoked by the Thatcher government’s negligence, which had left our classroom in a declining state, and I set out to create better public services for those who need it most – whether it was as a city councilman or a minister of government.
I have never concealed my policy, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who presented the resolution on Friday, I would like to say that when the country turns to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no form of threat of election or political suitability will keep me from acting on the basis of what I think is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr becomes top team
Two late scores may have gotten the final result to draw a not entirely true picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazingly entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only invincible team of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their better use of chance that brought the home team home, and coach Peter Murchie was absolutely right to be satisfied.
"Our games have been demanding so far and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Respect Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card to Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded for the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a scoring that was not up-to-date.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before the semi-finals. He scored and then got a solo score, so there were 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was taken out of the field on bars. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded the lead with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Acting Ayr leader Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the forthcoming Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick within the poles and followed up with a more nearly immediately after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe snapped up David Armstrong's box kick and sent flyer Gregor Henry to the home run's fifth score.
Still Game star looking for a new career in the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be taking the step to the restaurant industry after it emerged that he has taken over the position of director of an authorized restaurant business.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main character in which he co-stars with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the finale of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia's domestic state hopes that court will reopen route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol around the fleet's headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overlapped with the motto: “The sea is ours, it’s a right.
It is a duty to take it back.”
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of a coastal stretch that was lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still strong, and the same is the longing to sail the Pacific again.
The expectations are perhaps at their highest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
“Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course awaits with a positive look at the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country and hope that the Hague court will allow Bolivia to agree that, after decades of discussions, Chile is committed to negotiating to grant Bolivia sovereignty over an area of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake at the verdict on Monday.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he promised last August.
But analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will take the Bolivian party — and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which is based in the Netherlands, has no power to override Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice ruled just six months after the concluding arguments were heard indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of advancing the case of Bolivia, the last four years may have given way back.
"The matter of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales’ warring rhetoric has done so with the remaining Chilean benevolence, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was abnormally quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end an era of 139 years of disagreements and gain benefits for both parties,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political cruise.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
“The trial is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never lower its nuclear weapons if they can’t trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments were made in the wake of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently facing a restart of fixed nuclear diplomacy three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Mr Ri says it is a "wishful dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. resistance to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare it, as long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a more summit.
But there is widespread skepticism as to whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headwear, which you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne raised the veil on the catwalk for a remarkable collection of extra-large headwear as part of their SS19 collection. The collection was impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work from Valentino was a luxurious one with a mountain-like wide shadow covering the models’ heads.
There were also other extra-large accessories, including watermelons with jewelry and even a pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had tangled lips that resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high couture.
One creation resembled diving gray with snorkel and mask, and another resembled a melted waffle.
And if you continue the big fashiontatements, you are lucky.
Stylers predict that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The giant hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the beam hat with a 60 centimeters wide shade that is seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult behind the highly impractical hatred that was spread across social media has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the model that shows it.
The orange bast bag with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in ordinary stores next summer. The designer has had such an influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for huge-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills are Essential for Global Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have many great academic achievements behind them, and it continues in 2018 with a number of outstanding exam results, which are further enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can compile and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we find that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it hits the heart.”
It is an important reminder that we cannot only stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest exam results this year, that language is the highest in the statistics with the most graduated exams in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS’ 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received the grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competencies that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now perceived as subject selection at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools think and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that among the reasons employers could not occupy vacancies, 17% had to do with a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career they choose, if they have learned a different language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over the competitors.
According to a YouGov poll with over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
When more languages are spoken, especially from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, there is a difference between schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others teach in languages that are expected to be most important to the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from at independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed no matter what the future offers.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be truly important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and that needs to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this award to Scotland’s youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to Debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening match before the season starts against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he plays.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is unlikely to play the whole game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' planned six games before the season started.
"Where I am in my career, I don't have to fight before the start of the season to be ready," he said.
Trump's Electoral Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a streak of electorate meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five scheduled electorate meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump’s nominated judge to the vacant seat in the Supreme Court is pending, Trump is trying to create support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
When is the Trump Electoral Meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump’s election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held at midnight (Danish time) between Saturday, November 29th and Sunday, November 30th, 2018.
You can watch Trump's election in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump is most likely to talk about this week's hearings about Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court. The hearings were tense due to allegations of sexual abuse, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation has been suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating the prosecutors.
But the primary goal of this stripe of electorate meetings is to create momentum for the Republicans facing a tough election in November.
President Trump's campaign team said the five polls next week aimed to "create energy among volunteers and support when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control over Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible now that we are entering the busy campaign time," a Trump campaign spokesman, who would not be cited by name, told Reuters.
The summit will be held at the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to step up to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a professor of political science at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown excitement and trying to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday’s singles duels
After three unilateral rounds, Saturday’s four-man duels might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pair is an entirely invented sport concept, but a concept that players believe in – especially in competitions like this one.
Where would they say there is momentum now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we probably see it as a bit of momentum," said Jordan Spieth before he held the four nights.
Of course, Europe has the advantage. They are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 points more to play about.
As Spieth says, however, Americans feel that they have a bit of wind in the sails, and there are a lot of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and can both boast with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The loud shouts became higher as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important pit that secured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two strokes behind after two duels.
His pot, which secured them the fight on hole 15, was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows he doesn’t think the American team is out of competition yet.
“You just have to find the inner strength and focus on your own struggle,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the biggest history from the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s remarkable but sympathetic pairs have scored four points in four matches and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that did not get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy apparently flows both to and from the wild audience shows that it is the ones that will be the hardest to beat on Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory is squandered by Fleetwood or Molinari as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Synchronize each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial against Sergio Garcia, the morning of the four-man duels, when he formed a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never close to getting out of.
On Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The matches with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to look closely at due to the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change rapidly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man duels have also shown that Team USA has the game rush that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe sets 10-6 ahead of last day in the Ryder Cup
Europe has a big advantage before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the United States at 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and have so far scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's European team, trying to win the cup they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an inaccurate American team in the morning's four-balls and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes. They won four games but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team will need eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches if they want to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to have won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who have jointly been nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in Ryder Cup history to have won four points in their first four games.
They smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls and then elegantly defeated a relentless Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through his first two games on Saturday, had little brilliant glimpses, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven consecutively.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and got a 2-1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which is the third in the world.
Europe, however, has it quite as they want it, on a slight blowing day southwest of Paris.
Triple major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-hit 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has fought back after being behind four points before the singles matches. However, as the Furyks currently have the cup, they only have to achieve the unfinished to keep it.
After being second best for two days, however, it seems they can’t master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally downgrade if there is no trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions reinforce their distrust of the United States and that the country will not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s General Assembly that North Korea had shown “significant goodwill” over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, unraveling a nuclear testing area and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under such conditions, there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and underarm unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase-divisioned" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech seemed important as it did not unambiguously reject unilateral disarmament, as has otherwise been the case in the past from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work on “nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean War, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to softening harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’ and expands the pressure on sanctions to achieve their purpose by coercion and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions can put us on our knees is a dream of people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our distrust.”
Ri did not mention any more plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the past five months, adding: "If nuclear weapons were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so tight."
Nonetheless, the tone in Ris’ speech was very different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea’s rockets against the U.S. mainland was inevitable, after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened the UN with “total destruction” of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for his courage in terms of disarmament, but said there is still a lot to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea collapses.
Trump said Wednesday that he did not have a schedule for these actions, but said "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council must maintain the sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines during the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, while North Korea accused him of making "gang-resistant demands" just hours later.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to close a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States took "similar steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "similar steps" he demanded were the security promises Trump made in Singapore, as well as movements towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take courses on getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture, where studying all night held up by large amounts of caffeine.
A researcher has shown that students at the world’s best universities often don’t know the first thing to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, who is a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a speech about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"When the draft was finished, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why do I get to know this only now that I'm on the candidate?'
“She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits can improve one’s academic and sports performance as well as one’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the University’s health department, says the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course consists, among other things, of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a college room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how your sporting performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how long-term lack of sleep increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students right away.
But we think they have a right to know – just as we have a right to know how cigarettes affect health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is in taking an "allnighter" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to sleep deprivation being a growing problem.
The “secret weapon” against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to believe that one is hungry, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler organize the course last year when he took one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next step will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before they continue their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can raise awareness of the harmful effects of light from electronic screens, which can crack at the rhythm of the day and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals from Menga lowers Gerrard et al.
The Rangers suffered another defeat on the offfield, as Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's inconsistent team had to go on with a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox team were out after their first off-field win since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but the Gary Holts team gave Gerrard only the second defeat in 18 games as a coach, giving Hearts eight points up in the first place of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Many beat to seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond back to.
The Rangers now smoke down to sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third place after Hibernian with only the goal score difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to the Rangers, as line judge Calum Spence had to be dealt with after being hit in the head by a thrown object that seemed to come from the off-road section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the setup that reached the Betfed Cups semi-finals by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, faced the same 11 who shaved a point of Hearts' leadership last week, and he would have been pleased to see his sharp team exhausted opponents across the field.
The Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the game, when Menga's first-ever delivery sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempts were over.
A free kick deep from Keaghan Jacobs found his way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow jumped past the rear pole.
However, the Rangers took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attacking game.
Alfredo Morales was, at least, dissatisfied when Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian’s appeals for a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless came together after a quarter game.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Although Livi's opening in the 34th minute was a bit of a coincidence, it must be said to be worth their efforts alone.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a death ball situation in the depths of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga who could easily kick it in goal.
During the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave way as the flyer sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the team to play at their premises with many long balls up to the track from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead in the final part of the game, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow headed next to the goal.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late sentence after being wiped out with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we count... – was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the Geiger Counter.
The geiger counter has become a permanent part of both science and popular culture, as it could be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as peasant scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a gear counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you turn on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity of the minerals makes.”
Evans: "Stop it, now it's on!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Cancer Cells and Kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Cancer Cells as Part of Treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a variety of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "makes several cancers develop", including breast, ovarian, lung and intestinal cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
After an inconsistent performance in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was bent on praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he himself would run as presidential candidate in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the evening, Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again casket, he began a dunder talk against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
“I talk so often to white people who say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s racist?’
But if I were concerned about racism, I would have long since moved out of the United States,” he said.
The SNL began the evening show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony on the Senate Judicial Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of abuse.
Although the recordings were not shown, the comedian uploaded Chris Rock Wests shot on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to expose West by putting up the recordings.
West also complained to the public about ill-treatment backstage due to his headdress.
"They mobbed me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They mobbed me!
And they said I was deep down,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how deeply I am immersed?", and said that he would take his Superman cape on because it means, "You can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try it with love.”
The audience shuddered at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassingly affected, Variety reported with a comment from a person present: "There was bomb silence in the studio."
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing with the song I Love It while he was dressed up as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the Conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR NOT LEAVING YOU OF THE PUBLIC."
Talkshow host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "who he is, and it's absolutely fine."
“But I do not choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) that embraces and develops an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he had changed his name to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has named Snoop Lion, and the recently-deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Prosecution for attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought to the Belfast court on Monday.
The sentences are reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is on the verge of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor longs for the stereotypical macho hero and says that kind of TV characters mean young men often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit told Sunday Times Culture that he thinks "something has gone wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem is "very much on his mind".
“At the moment, I think about it – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?” he said.
“If we look at the current problems, what is it that we have taught young men in their upbringing?”
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is born, and what is allowed?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel like they have to be men in this way?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
For it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not make successors to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "ending with battlefields and horses".
In November, Kit plays Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film director and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers having met his wife Rose as the best of the entire Game of Thrones experience.
“I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
Much of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way has been reduced to something close to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men sooner or later marry women because of the country’s conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of use of contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaked data on Republican senators and slams "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the House of Representatives, denied Saturday allegations that a member of her staff shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations came from websites and support from “the far right.”
“Lies, lies, and more horrible lies,” Waters wrote in a tweet.
The published information allegedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers on U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information on Thursday was posted online by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
This happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites such as the Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by the Waters people, after which they published information about a member of Waters staff.
“This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie.”
Waters’ exit was quickly criticized online, among other things by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that she doesn't have the right temperament to be a congresswoman.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, don't get angry.
You mustn't be rude.
Do not question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to keep your mind calm.”
Fleischer suggested comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also made his point on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she said her staff had contacted "the relevant authorities and the law enforcement regarding these fraudulent allegations."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English hits again – underwhelming spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in every newer film with a British glacier, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the bold, sarcastic self-sacrificing view of how unsettled it is with us become the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English with his rubber face and big eyes has been given his permission to make roars again and again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic invention aimed at places where cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the tumbled secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife tip Mr. Bean and really climbed by him performing a single tone for the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international slippery pantyhose that left chaos in his wake after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard television commercials.
There are some good moments in this recent shot on the stem from JE.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval apparatus, and the propellers sounded toward his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comics can be seen, but the humor feels rather overwhelming and strangely superfluous, especially now that more “serious” movie series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy adventure is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point for the film is that the UK is in serious turmoil.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England’s top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field of terror for the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last chance for a pompous and combat-ready prime minister who already suffers a complete melting of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there’s not much to work on in the script.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been revealed, she is forced to cancel someone’s pension.
And of course, it's Johnny English, who's now a high school inspector at a high school, but who's secretly teaching how to become a secret agent. There's some funny sequences here when English stands for some kind of School of Rock training in espionage.
English is rushed back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with his hard-hitting former right hand Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an over-enthusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain – a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the Royal Intelligence Service is completely unhappy Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister is about to immigrate to the charismatic and terrifying tech billionaire Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their angry, risky escapes: disguised as servants, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with Volta's home.
All the canons are fired in the final sequence of the film, but no matter how well-meaning and energetic it is, there’s a sense of children’s television over it.
Pretty mediocre.
And what I couldn’t avoid thinking about with the other Johnny English movies: Can’t the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to barter plans on four-day working week with unchanged wages for British citizens
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour is said to consider a radical plan so that the Englishmen can be satisfied with a four-day work week but get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that the employees would have three days of weekend without going down in wages.
Sources say the idea would match the party's economic goal of pulling the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party told The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
“It’s not going to happen in one day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits the Party’s approach to changing the economy for the benefit of the workers and the Party’s overall strategy for industry.”
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea as the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
The goal, however, is not unanimously supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not the party’s policy and is not under consideration in the party.”
Labour shadow finance minister John McDonnell used last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to take power back from “anonymous directors” and “use” in supply companies.
Shadow finance minister's plans also raise doubts as to whether current shareholders in water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour in charge could "count" them on the basis of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to get employees in corporate boards and to set up including ownership funds, which will allocate 10% of the share value of private companies to employees who are receiving up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the FBI findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig out something that could make them change their mindset.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his South Carolina colleague.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this — after the accusations came up — and said, “Did you do that?”
He was steely, determined and unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, seems to be melted in stone.
"I have decided with regard to Brett Kavanaugh, and the other would require a very violent charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett denies it at the most," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
That happened 36 years ago.
I can’t see that that would change anything.”
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive selection of artists and an equally impressive goal – to end the world’s poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s large lawns, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organization that strives to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert participants must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do volunteer work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or other meaningful action that can create attention to an endsome goal.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert create real change, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” – that is, that people feel they are making a difference by signing a collection online or making a Twitter post?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different targets.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to set binding targets and policy measures equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion, which by 2030 are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 goals and actions that had become due to their actions, amounting to more than <0x24>10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main goals is The Power of Nutrition, which has been launched in England and is a collaboration between investors and strong people. They strive to "help children to experience their full potential" and promise <0x24>35 million to remedy nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Ci.
“With the help of the British government, donors, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books,” Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now promised funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In response to one of the website’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen wrote: “It’s going to be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we’ll fall down and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movements, it will succeed because we are stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year’s festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are scheduled to host.
US could use its fleet to "block" Russian energy exports, US Home Secretary says
"If necessary," Washington could use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s interference in Syria – especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to expand sales of their energy.
“I think they’re in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States has with our fleet the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the sea routes, and if necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organization that sees itself as “the voice of the American energy consumer.”
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are basically the same.
“The economic possibilities in relation to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase European exports of liquefied natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, spokesmen for the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin believes Washington’s strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose a supplier," Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with US energy minister Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met with criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, BDI, has called on the United States to intervene outside the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem that a third party is interfering with our energy supplies,” BDI leader Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "resolved strongly" to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren is "strongly considering" running for president after the midterm elections, she said on Saturday.
During a town council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering resigning.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in the front,” she said.
"After November 6, I will consider strongly to stand up for the presidential election."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during the city council and said he is “guiding the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been voiced in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren tweeted: “Of course, the FBI will have to investigate the case before the vote.”
However, a poll from Thursday shows that most of Warren’s own backyard doesn’t believe she should stand up in 2020.
According to an opinion poll from the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not post.
32% supported the possible nomination.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick with 38% for and 48% against a possible stance.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential election include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will announce his final decision in January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's Electoral Meeting
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through after he has come home makes me relate to other families that feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries our soldiers are returning home with,” she told the audience at a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and have become harder. They go and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, to prevent the report of domestic violence and to be in possession of a drunken weapon, said Dan Bennet, a Wasillas police spokesman.
18 states and D.C. support resistance to new asylum
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. law denying asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a party-independent statement in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker opposing the law.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions trial, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal law, has not been published.
She says her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers originate, as countries with far-reaching problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law rejected a decision taken by the U.S. Foreign Office in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new law "dismisses decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle is contrary to this principle," the party-independent statement said.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on the rejection of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as it is more likely that they will become independent and “provide necessary labour.”
In June, Justice Jeff Sessions' immigration judges deprived the right to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political standing,” Sessions said in a statement.
It has never been meant that asylum should solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, while comforting her fever-stricken boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute the ambulance comes in with the body.
We need clean water.”
Residents now returned to their ruined homes to sort through soaked possessions and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were also affected by the 7.5 earthquake, could not accompany.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were located outside Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to severe backstrokes.
He got tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I got masked up against a broken wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was going to a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Ugly Methods and Propaganda Advertisements
A week after a Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper that drummed for the benefits of U.S.-China cooperation, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid entry in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional election.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump’s accusation of Chinese interference in the U.S. election marks a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to announce to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now trapped in an escalating trade war, where they have repeatedly imposed tariffs on each other’s import goods.
China’s retaliation tariffs in the trade war would hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, a former U.S. ambassador to China, a former governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a headline in Sunday’s Des Moines Register that China is “advancing the use of unfathomable methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, you will find only a few disagreeing voices, and you will not get a straightforward picture of the different attitudes of the Chinese people to China's worrying economic direction, as the media is under strict control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans alienate women ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
While many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The case has put the feelings in jeopardy, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This cannot be done again," Grant Reher, professor of state science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article on Saturday.
Reher said he doubts that a request by Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona) for an FBI investigation in the 11th hour will bring mild anger to voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they don’t forget tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group, according to The Hill.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted during a demonstration in the Senate: "November is coming!" when Republicans, who control the legal committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights,” independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news.
“People say it has already reached a high level; that’s right.
But it can now be even higher, especially among female swing voters in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29-year-olds – who rarely vote, despite not being liked by the president.”
Even before Ford’s public accusations of the Supreme Court’s sexual abuse, analysts had pointed out that it could be a backlash if the Republicans continued the nomination.
“It has become a worse mess for the Republicans,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final result or Kavanaugh being held accountable; it’s also about how the Republicans have handled it here and how they have treated it,” Guy Cecil, president of Priorities USA – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – told the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views on who to believe after the testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony for sure or probably, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh for sure or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was either likely or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another, Deborah Ramirez writes to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford told the Senate Judiciary that Kavanaugh completely abused her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her sex parts for a party when they both studied at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the internet, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a new company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project is Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that Inrupt's plan was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology so people can create their own “personal online data collection” or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data”.
The idea with Inrupt is, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, to gather the resources, processes and abilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google about whether they should change it completely so that all of their business models suddenly become superfluous.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a press release on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet being built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is being launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Recipient of the Victory Cross from World War I
The only priest in the English church who won the Victorian Cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel and priest Bernard Wann won the order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military command.
On Saturday, a memorial was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's order-wrong business.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led his people forward with the "best man's courage" before attacking an artillery and harmless three cannons alone.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother James Vann also made a crown after the parade, which was directed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "feels very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support from all these people emphasizes the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine you’ve been up all night to see the star-studded Bellator 206 and then refuse to see the main event.
There were 13 games on the program from San Jose, including six games on the main program, and they were shown overnight in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to meet, the viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until the early morning of this match.
A fan on Twitter described the shift to a children’s cartoon as “a sort of sick joke.”
"According to legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children's programs," Bellator's senior vice president Dave Schwartz said when asked about the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yeah."
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they would work to include English viewers in the planning in the future.
“When we think about the retransmission, I think we can make it work,” Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there, and we can't find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Trust me, when it was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But that was actually the legislation.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We are content with five games instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minority" over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt less value than anyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it didn’t happen to him until he came into the larger classes that “not everyone is like me.”
While on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said he went less to win the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The usual host on the radio program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first program and said he felt "less worth" than anyone else in his growing up, because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
“Until today, the feelings of feeling worthy of memory and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they knew his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others “hope”.
The triple world champion said he was “surprised” when he fell in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when going through so much at such a young age – he took to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would be all about whether I should win a gold medal," he said.
But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had gotten tickets to London 2012 – when he would be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there at the time.
“I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first came to my mind that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead,” he said.
The following year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – that had meant a lot during the admission to the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Uskarp Mickelson on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to do something about the form if it’s not going to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who set the record for the 12th time to participate in the competition, which takes place every 2 years, was placed on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events for the United States as usual, the five-fold big lady had to act on the helms and practice on her game in hopes of fixing the slips.
Even not at the height of his career, he had the most straight drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the field at Le Golf National, where the long rough often penalizes wild shots.
And if the pitch wasn’t big enough, Mickelson will meet the always precise winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 single camps start strongly, Mickelson’s battle can be crucial.
Furyk did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a blow on my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I didn’t think he was going to play two games.
I imagined he'd play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson beat Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully matched his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven unfinished, although Furyk said his presence contributes with something undefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's funny, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just the game.”
Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows from experience that a solid lead before the last day of Ryder Cups singles can quickly become nervous.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but was just getting ahead of the goal line with a win of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just won," Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said after watching the 2018 team win both on Friday 5-3 and yesterday for a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it’s not over.
It's gonna be full of rubbish tomorrow.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that’s where our focus lies.
I’ve always said that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Satisfied with his players' performance on a difficult track, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow it is the individual performance that counts, and it is something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when it’s going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested on all parameters as a golfer.
That’s what players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he will also get the best out of himself.”
In other words, it looks like opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performances than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced conundrums on the last day, first at the Brookline win, before he lost, when Europe made the "Miracle on Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players in 1999 before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one wants to have a good start, as one saw at Brookline, as one saw at Medinah.
Once momentum has found a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the intermediate matches.
We’re putting our team together and putting the players on the pitch in the order we feel. We’re trying to create magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the rebound and face Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the series.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it will secure us all the way through," Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said of his choice of singles.
Germany's new warship is postponed again
The German fleet’s latest frigate should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War, but the Germans have to wait at least another year due to technical problems and an escalating price, local media reported.
The deployment of the largest vessel in the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a spokesman from the military.
The ship should have become part of the fleet in 2014, but compliance problems have hampered the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest frigates is a lesser need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are said to make Germany appear as an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when deployed.
The failed F125 frigate created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of decisive "software and hardware errors" that rendered the warship useless in combat situations.
Software errors were of particular importance as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class had to be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – that is only half of the crew of the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's possibility of future updates.
The 7000-ton heavy "Rhineland-Palatinate" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the cost of the project, which includes training the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion), with an initial price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval force is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government's defence committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "is running dry for deployment-ready ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were removed from use without being replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust whistleblowers for the secret life of bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands attempts to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the unique behavior of flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland’s National Trust and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-haired bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of the bats throughout the season.
Data is also collected from NTS personnel and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the flag muscles and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
NTS Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the creation of grasslands, and how to best preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban enlargement projects that affect the landlords and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
The flag mouse is not blind.
But because they mainly hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced ecologicalization technique to find insects and fly without obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect ships, and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten Scottish bat species.
The landlord, David Thompson, says it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There’s a lot you don’t know about bats, so work here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before doing maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and youngsters, thereby risking the destruction of an entire local population.
Flag mouse is peaceful, and it is illegal to kill, disturb or disturb them or their knights.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to give a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how populations develop."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him “fake news” and says people will “promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he has paid her <0x24>375,000 to keep it secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations had been released, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-fold winner of the Ballon d'Or told the camera.
“They will promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges they have called "an unforgivable publication of suspicions about the privacy sphere".
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class similar to the charge, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly took her back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to the report submitted to the city court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99% of the time" seized by "one percent".
The case documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and got her injuries photographed at a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court deal because she felt "feared of revenge" and worried about being "publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old now says she wants to overturn the deal as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, when the incident was due to take place, and this summer moved to Italian big club Juventus for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that longer waiting time at the border in case of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
“As I see it, production will stop at our factory if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March,” said Burnaston CEO Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed fears of leaving the EU without a cross-border trade agreement.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers has to do with the risks of the supply chain in the event of a non-contractual withdrawal.
Toyota’s production runs on a tight schedule, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, which, according to the automotive industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day of production at the Derbyshire plant, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "combined so that these border inspections are precisely avoided."
“We need to have a deal, we want the best deal that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the long run higher prices would reduce the factory’s competitiveness, eventually costing jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: “My experience tells me that once these jobs disappear, they won’t come back.”
A spokesman for the government said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could "be postponed for another week" as the supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller looks over his shoulder during his investigation of Russian electoral interference, relations between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction to the course of the court.
Whether Trump wants to fire the deputy justice minister, thereby risking Mueller’s independence, has been a slacker in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president via paragraph 25.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor went that he was going to quit.
Instead, a meeting was agreed on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate Judicial Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate election.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There is no date. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed for a week with everything that is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date.”
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to TV journalists' games for the gallery, but added: "I do not disagree that they play up to the camera."
She said the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding without citing a source: "We have looked at the numbers."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to give it a lot of opportunity, and you’ve seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it’s going to be in place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press conferences with senior guests.
Press conferences with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the journalists present.
Minister of Health contacts EU staff in Scottish health care after Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express Scotland’s gratitude and desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying for permanent residence applications for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continue, and it seems that decisions are expected for the autumn.
But the British government has also increased their preparations for a possible Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very insecure period for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the effort each employee has made, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU come with valuable experiences and competencies that strengthen and improve health care work for the benefit of patients and the local community.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay.
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was acutely operated after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's first coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell out there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a bar and took him into further examination.
A spokesman from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are "no details about the type or extent of the injury yet", and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he inflicted the injury.
Abercrombie is studying in her second year and is starting her first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp tax when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK. The extra money is supposed to help the homeless, according to the Conservative Party.
This feature is intended to mitigate Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to procure <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to the homeless.
Theresa May will propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and pursuing them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The proceeds from here must be used for the government's struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The extra fee, which is added above the current plumbing fee and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and rental purchases, can reach up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, causing prices to rise and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "fantasy towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new bill comes weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying grounds they don't use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap housing to solve Britain's "horrible housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching range of housing reforms, including checking rental prices and depriving the landlord of the opportunity to put people on the street if they comply with the rental contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing buildings.
"Last year I said I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as for hard-working British people.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the indifference to sleep on the street is still too widespread.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach"
Sunderland’s boss, Jack Ross, says his “ultimate goal” is at some point to become Scotland’s coach.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the North East club, now third in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that was it," Ross told Scotland's Sportssound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland on the Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it has always attracted me.
However, that opportunity would only arise if I were successful in coaching clubs.”
Ross's predecessors as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic said he had no worries about following after established names in such a big club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success by whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
From the structure and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly home to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I’ll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back to it.”
Ross is only three years in his career as a coach after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's coaching loss.
Afterwards, he helped Alloa come back after being relegated to third-best row and transformed St Mirren from the relegation threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a player for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real divorce," he recalls of the time in Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that the training exercise was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I did it well, served reasonably and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are many things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
There is still the kind of stress and pressure that trains, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it. I haven't been more comfortable with myself in my whole adult life."
You can listen to the entire interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30th at Radio Scotland between 12.00 and 13.00 BST.
The best time for a beer is Saturdays at 5:30 p.m., study shows
The heatwave this summer has increased earnings for England’s pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants fell by 4.8%, figures show.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business consultant, who has collected the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long World Cup has meant that July follows the June pattern, where pubs experienced 2.8% surplus sales, except that restaurants are harder hit now.
The decline of 1.8% in restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focusing on the sale of beverages clearly managed the best and experienced progress corresponding to the decline of the restaurants.
Pubs focusing on food suffered in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that people just want something to drink.
Over the pub and bar chains, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% per month, while food dropped by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, analyzing the service industry, said: “The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the outside-of-home market, weather and major social or sporting events are the biggest factors.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still struggling, although a drop in sales of 4.8% year-on-year will really hurt over rising costs.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will give a hard-needed breathing space."

One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – up to 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a study.
A survey of 20,000 4-9th graders reveals growth in “false Insta” pages.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being posted.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show to their parents
One in five children up to the age of 11 create accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from 4th grade and above reveals a strong growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to Instagram image sharing service.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being posted.
20% of students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents while they also have private ones.
A mother, who fell over her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account, saw a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools, found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
HMC’s leader, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s scary that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most winning athletic athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the athletic world of Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are confident that Scotland's athletics will benefit from getting her on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can contribute and help set a direction for sports in Scotland."

Advertising for breast pump, comparing mothers with cows, getting mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows that are breastfed.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump,” the tech consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement that will show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a costume filled with hay, to a song in which it blurts: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, it's not up here, it's my breasts."
"Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my belly."
But the ad, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from viewers. Many say it laughs at the "fears" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and feed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth.”
Breast pumps from Elvie pass discreetly in a breast (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote: “Comprehensibly traumatic enough for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?”
Another added: "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement. A woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump milk (often in their workplace or in the toilet) and feel like 'cows'.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bra.
The concept behind advertising is based on the fact that many women who are breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is completely silent, has no tubes or hoses and fits discreetly in a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and CEO of Mother, wrote: “The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and breastfeeding cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while in an entertaining and recognizable way we showed the freedom that the new pump can provide."
It's not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camp at Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has exploded, although the number of border guards has not changed, partly because of tougher rhetoric and the Trump administration’s harsher laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their chances of staying in the country by standing up and adopting a child.
The risk of being sent home increased in June, when authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would provide fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to Congress that they had arrested several people seeking to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had pure criminal records.
“Nearly 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors’ households are illegally residing in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still chasing those people," Albence said.
In an attempt to deal with cases of children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention.
Many use video calls instead of themselves to appear and speak their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those convicted of unjustified residence are deported quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or attempted escape, says aid workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better relationships say these risks are more pronounced at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on if a child suffers.
They added that moving to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate trauma, which many are already struggling with.
Syria announces U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
When Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the stay of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the pretext of combating terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is “almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have cleared all Syrian territories" for both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
In the refugee area, Moualem said conditions were good enough to allow them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unwarranted fear" that caused refugees to leave.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these returns,” he said.
"They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province of three million people was avoided.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military actions would go after jihadists from the Nusra Front, an outgoing group of Al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the new committee's first meetings soon to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "revising legislation in the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Trump wins another presidential term
Based on that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the state trial and scandals end his presidential term prematurely, which many liberal viewers hope to see.
In what is undoubtedly “The Most Dramatic End of a Presidential Period Ever!”
There are currently no signs of sighting activity.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the best broadcast time has almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcast time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million on nights with big news.
"It's a spectacle that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who leads the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a leader of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author bag "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he wanted to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” said Scovell.
Chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike all other TV shows, the stories that come from Washington can determine the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing channels is just the most privileged forgotten.
And yet it is more than an enlightened citizen when you see a six-hour panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's strudel leather jacket for <0x24>15,000 ("clothed with hybris", wrote The Washington Post's anamymics) and the implication of Daniel's Great.
I will never see Super Mario in the same way.
"Something that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's rotating crew and daily surprises (disputes with N.F.L.)
But if you miss an episode, you're off.
When I got to Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court to be decided.
“I remember when we made all these crazy shows before in time, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Large sums find their way to the close mid-term election to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives large sums of money. As a result of the settlement of two "Congressional Districts" two congressmen are fighting for the same seat.
This newly converted suburban district in Pittsburgh creates problems for Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a second special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which strongly overlaps with the new 17.
The cards were remade after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old district was illegally set up in favor of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th district has started a fight for financial means between the major party committee, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a highly vigilante election in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been in Republican hands for over ten years, and President Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give Democrats a small advantage.
U.S. considers punishing El Salvador for support for China, but re-decided
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners threw out the Trump leadership team.
Foreign ministry officials decided to call back leading U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after “the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished. They received about <0x24>140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials dispatched a summit on security and economic development, which should have continued last year's meeting, which is considered to be a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, thereby dropping the considerations of penalties to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October to send a signal about the importance that the Americans place in the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh demands or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the case described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who would like to talk about internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst, who is close to the administration, and who also spoke on the basis of a condition of anonymity.
Know the history
The next obstacle could very well be the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction to the investigation, which is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Mueller said he would also direct his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the election.
If Congress were to come into new hands, Trump would likely be held accountable as he prepares to meet voters again and, with time, of course, a jury of his peers.
There are many insecurities, and I do not claim that Trump’s end is inevitable – and the same applies to his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if only the West could resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not take the opportunity to avoid the years-long bloodbath afterwards.
It is around such turning points that the axis of history revolves, and the irreversible march of democracy to-or-decreases.
In the United States, many of these changes are now being made.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been hot since this newspaper was able to announce that last year he had proposed to make covert recordings of the president and challenged his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is inaccurate.
“How do we respond if F.B.I.’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly carried out – or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote in midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime itself, which once occupied the homeland of my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath lights on the table with the garden cross.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic ahead of the match against SK Rapid Wien
After the impressive undecided result in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they will have a great chance to move on from Group G of the Europa League with a win against Austrians.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from finishing the season before the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a jumpboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went to the fight with the belief that we could get something home and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken the stick home, but overall it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
We hope to get three points, but it's going to be difficult because they got a good result in the last game, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been tough because of everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it. We train well.
Hopefully we can run now, put the last season behind us and succeed.”
Fear of retirement savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, only a few spoke to their family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do anything to start the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them about your wishes in time.
Use your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you want to receive care. These choices can be decisive factors for the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, among other things, by means of a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have the money to do so.
Get the legal documents arranged: Take the legal battles in progress.
Get prepared a power of attorney so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Also consider an economic power.
In this case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the option yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aging parents is in urgent need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy - who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who cares for the dog?
Get the plan in place.”
Man shot several times with air crash in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an airstrike on his way home from a trip to the city.
The victim was in the 1940s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, middle floor and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 p.m., as "totally accidental."
The victim did not see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities, which expect the number of deaths to increase.
As the communication routes are out of play, emergency workers have not been able to receive information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency that extends over more than 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the cornerstones of the central Sulawesi economy, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but mainly takes place in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster center, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is seismologically located on the so-called Pacific Fireworks and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A severe earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and only in April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that led to the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and spread destruction and panic as the population was reminded of 2004’s deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily on the beach.
Sarah Palin's eldest son targeted for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and to oppose arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from a female acquaintance as she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a <0x24>500 security deposit, KTUU reports.
He was brought to court on Saturday, in which he declared himself “clearly not guilty,” the network reports.
Palin is prosecuted for three Class A crimes, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to one year and a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He has also been prosecuted for a Class B crime, which can result in a single day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been prosecuted for crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently under trial at Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was tried for domestic violence, for preventing the reporting of a violent crime in the home, and for possession of weapons in the affected condition in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after explaining her son’s violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his deployment to Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed several hundred homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating that show the moment when the earthquake hits.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu, when the tsunami brought the coast.
Public prosecutors try to get terrorist suspect in NYC sentenced to rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to sentence Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people – a rare sentence last condemned for a crime in the state in 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental car from the Home Depot building market in October to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got into the road were beaten down.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, as required by the Statement of Intent for the Death Penalty in New York's southern district.
According to the court document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these sentences.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury could present Saipov for a 22-point indictment, including eight charges of murder in connection with gangs, which are typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "extensive planning and preparation," the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "unholy, malicious and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused personal injury, bodily injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s southern district last raised the defendant in a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but ended up serving a life sentence in September 2009.
In 1953, in New York City, the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple was executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov was from Uzbekistan and, according to legal documents, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told the investigators that he was well with his actions.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He has denied guilt in the 22 paragraphs of the Prosecution’s Prosecution.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, said they were “of course disappointed” with the prosecutors’ decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s lawyers had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister Says Nigel Farage Should Take Over Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army" during a demonstration at today's Conservative meeting.
The former Ukip leader said politicians could “feel pressure” from Eurosceptics after one of Theresa May’s own ministers said Farage should take over the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have been "out now" if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May’s challenge to create a coalition in the deeply divided party is underlined by the fact that conservatives are participating in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track during attacks by both Brexiteers, the remnants and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the backlash, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thereby forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or “chaos”.
For the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough's minister added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we have to scrape the Chequers."
On the backdrop of his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate to anyone.
We will determine our own laws in our own country.”
Bone declined that the public's attitude should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Now drop Chequers, and start listening.'
As a top remark to May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the record that politicians should be able to "feel pressure" if they fail the decision from the 2016 vote.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They will betray Brexit, but we are gathered to tell them that we will not let them go.”
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “You need to make sure that the political class that is on the verge of betraying Brexit can feel pressure.
“We are mobilizing the People’s Army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, the remains marched through Birmingham before a two-hour footage in the city center.
Spreading activists fanned out with Conservative Against Brexit banners following the formation of the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis laughed at the security issues with the Conservative Party app before the meeting.
“It’s the people who claim to have control over Canada’s IT systems and technology, for border controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he said.
"It's all laughing.
There’s nothing called a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren 'considered strongly' to stand up for presidential election
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a member of the House of Representatives, is “strongly considering running for presidential elections” after the midterm elections in November.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a city council meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, is expected to seek re-election in November against the state’s Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It has been speculated that she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters at the House of Commons since Trump took office.
A participant asked her if she was planning to run for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it is time for “women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in the front.”
Arrested in case of shooting at LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Friday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from the LSU.
Baton Rouge police said 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested on Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting to ask for help identifying a man on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of the injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul said in a statement.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to having been present, in possession of a weapon and having shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without problems and is now in the police custody of the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two-metre-high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played an average of 17.4 minutes, making 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Cup after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a crucial role in the race.
From the lead position Bottas got a good start and was close to hanging Hamilton completely off as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in the pit as the first, leaving Hamilton to fight with the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went into the pit a little later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came forward again, as the Ferrari driver after some wheel contact reluctantly had to leave the inner lane after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven in the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race as he failed to change tyres in an attempt at a quick finish to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to go into the pit in the 44th lap, but could not increase the pace in the last eight laps, which is why Raikkonen secured the fourth place.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did it fantastic all weekend and was really a gentleman when he let me pass.
"The team did an incredible job of securing us both first and second place," Hamilton said.
Really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a poll on Saturday for insisting she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sex abuse.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony Ford had given before the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "dishonest and disgusting and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and they say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, were you the one who leaked it?
Remember her answer... Were you the one who leaked the document – “oh, oh, what?
No, no, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hov, wait a second.
We have leaked... No, we have not leaked anything,” he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter of Ford’s accusations against Kavanaugh back in July and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I have not concealed Dr. Ford's allegations, and I have not leaked her history," Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did.”
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said during Saturday’s election: “I’m telling you that it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Under the president’s continued defense of the nominated judge in the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, Trump suggested that Democrats use the charges to benefit their own case.
"They don't spend any money in their efforts to take power back.
You can see the evil, the disgusting, they don't care who they're drumming to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars did well again after Friday's losing Elite League game to the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly came forward with two goals with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie scored at home before Dwyer again brought the Giants forward.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win by two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's team, which came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's match in Belfast.
It was the fourth match of the season between the sides where the Giants went out victorious in the previous three games.
Dwyer scored in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as an assistant, as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants came ahead at the first break as he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard scored again with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the team's fifth goal win halfway through the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their five games, are home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffickers die to ensure hundreds of air passengers avoid earthquakes
A flight attendant in Indonesia is praised as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers safely landed on the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake on Friday struck Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still wreak havoc on the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old colleagues of Anthonius Gunawan Agung fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the swinging control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed back in his place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which held on the starting track, came safely into the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, told Australian ABC News that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're broken," he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the country's disaster preparedness announces that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six-meter-high waves have destroyed Palu, which is holding a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying emergency aid and supplies in.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the shops are plundered.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to do.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work around the clock to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombrok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says a man is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, even though it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini said Saturday afternoon could not locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Locals helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and the exact order of the incidents.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the landing track.
Some witnesses believed that the plane flew past the landing track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could go into the water to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and shouted, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working to renovate a nearby cabin also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to carry people on land before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts set a timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office concluded its prosecution on Saturday in the wake of the indictment of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett made testimonials for several hours as experts in data analytics.
He described to the jury how he used telecommunications to counteract the story of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger writes.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat in the witness's office on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "laughed because my truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at a time after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hiphop trio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip hop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They will go back to the starting point and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in the UK due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Still a black person?!
New York babysitter sues couple after firing with ‘racist’ text
A New York babysitter sues a couple for discriminatory firing after being sent a text message by a mistake from her mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the lawsuit to "oppression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her horror at finding out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEJ, NOT A PERSON," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice fired and said that their former African-American midwife had been bad for her job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one-day job and sent home in an Uber.
Giselle Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the firing as well as compensation for <0x24>350 a day for the six months she should have lived with the family, even if this was agreed without a contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t afford to do something like that,” she told the newspaper on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
“My wife had come to send her something she wouldn’t have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been unskilled about, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Absolutely honest."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "depressing" and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you really going after someone that way?
It’s not very friendly,” the investment adviser added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the Civil Court has already written down the couple on social media and shamed their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared readers could not relate to a speaking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for release, said of the letter: "It is difficult to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was released.
It’s a lot of fun to read now that you know how popular Paddington became.”
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired to write the children’s book about a small clothing bag, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was “bitter-sweet” after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to brag," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who achieved something: you’re proud of them, even though it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say that it was Paddington's fault."
Saying goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad called on a regular basis to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“So I got a call from Nad that she was going to die in the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you later.
The medicine she had been given to keep her heart running slowly lost its effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now her body was closed.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together.”
Eventually, the sad Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I bent my head and the tears continued to run.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sad women try to stop suicide shoppers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers to get help.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he got depressed and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parents to experience the grief I experience every day,” she said.
Sharon Davis, 45, said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
"His smile was known to everyone.
People said his smile lit up the room.”
However, he stopped working before he died because he was really bad.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found him after he took his life.
Sharon Davis said, “I’m always afraid it will spread.”
Sharon Davis made the cards to tell people that there is someone out there who you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don’t go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Sharon Davis's longtime friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost his girlfriend over 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say anything about being sorry for it or depressed or something,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, he started to change.
He was really far down on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: “It has created a hole in our family.
It has torn us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh remains unclear, while the FBI is investigating
“I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a limited-time study with limited scope – maybe we could get a bit of agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would “fall from the incline” in the middle of the locked party situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct their investigation?
Their detention is due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans, as expected, are doing poorly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have elected to the country’s highest judiciary.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has completed its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet known whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans 'fall' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean smugglers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from South Korea’s merger ministry and said there were 1,127 pick-ups last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park noted that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher figures due to human smugglers were contributing to the changed figures.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
The vast majority of North Korean buyers will eventually be granted citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean government says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee via China, which has the longest border up to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the detainees to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often forced into exile.
Relations between North and South Korea – which is technically still at war – have improved dramatically over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This takes place after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against a nuclear-free Korea at an overall level.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances, it is excluded that we will demolish ourselves,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unsuitable for the Supreme Court
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for Supreme Court Judges, "hysterical" and said his temperament was not appropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh strongly rejected the allegations that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when he was a teenager.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his high school years, he almost screamed and was about to cry.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him "grotesque and coordinated character courage" arranged by the left wing angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with the statements and the way he followed Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi walked out when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a state court if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly rather in the court he's sitting in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in connection with Obama's health reform or abortion Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, pre-determined person should contest a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it's not just nice'," Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, months and years of anger, and she can't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal, do you?"
She continued, "I got a lot of support from a woman who was the boss who said she was crying when she got angry too, but she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
But I'm angry."
And then she just knew.
And I thought it was genius.”
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see you're crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They’ll think you’re sorry, and they’ll agree that they hit you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was a member of the Congress of Democrats from Colorado at the time, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to have an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she could as well run as a presidential candidate.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she said laughingly to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the run-up, and they certainly didn't need another candidate.
Some called it 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind fundraising, so she promised not to participate unless she raised <0x24>2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave <0x24>1,000 to men, only gave her <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a speech that she did not want to stand up, she was overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration about the system that made it so hard to travel money and reach voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she got a lump in the throat.
“You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls about how the press reacted to her.
“You should have thought I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening slogans in the US-China trade war were loud, and although the battle is far from over, division between the countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on important Chinese export products such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation this week with new customs duties affecting goods worth <0x24>200 billion applies in principle to half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Beijing has paid back every time, at the latest by imposing tariffs of 5-10% on U.S. goods for <0x24>60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the world’s second-largest economy probably doesn’t give up just for the time being.
If it makes Washington withdraw its demands, it means they surrender, but for China’s President Xi Jinping it will be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, U.S. pressure in the trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
“A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the groundwork for an economy that could come out of control in both countries, and it’s actually much more dangerous than we thought,” Abigail Grace, a research fellow with a focus on Asia at the Center for New American Security, said in a statement.
Syria is ‘ready’ to receive refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says the country is ready for refugees to return and asks for help to build the country that has been destroyed by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All conditions are now in place for refugees to return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further 6 million people still in the country need emergency assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government was willing to accept help to rebuild the hardened country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped support the uprising.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup and beat the American team 16.5 – 10.5 in Le Golf National outside of Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Björn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had difficulty in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake at pair 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari managed well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have been 5-0-0 since 1979, when the current format of the tournament began.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 by the lowest-ranked European player, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
<0x23>1 on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the bag, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I’m really happy to get the trophy back.
It’s a team effort and I’m happy to be able to help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He forwards the fake to his countryman John Ram, who dropped the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single-match Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
This is a joke statistic for one of the best golfers ever to have won 14 great titles, only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had trouble finding the form over the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of the boys, because they fought for the case.
There was still time this morning when we played against Europe.
You lost.
Hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We want to regroup, and I want to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we move on.
I love the 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten your hat.
We were defeated.”
Algae flowering update: Concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decreasing algal concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, there are reports of widespread blooms in the area around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – suggesting that the concentration is decreasing.
The flowering of algae spreads over a coastline of 210 km from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
