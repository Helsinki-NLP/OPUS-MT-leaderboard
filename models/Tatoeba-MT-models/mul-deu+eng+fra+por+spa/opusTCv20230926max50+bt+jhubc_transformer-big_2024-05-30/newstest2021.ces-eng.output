Novák helped Trabzonspor to second place, also hit <0xC5><0xA0>koda
Defender Filip Novák helped in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspore to win the title of vice-champion.
His team won 2-1 at Kayserispor and kept the third Besiktas behind.
Attacker Milan <0xC5><0xA0>koda already scored 10 goals for Rizespor after moving from Slavia in January, even though he scored 1-3 on Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed excellent productivity to the defender with the seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute, goalkeeper Kayserisporu just shot a sharp shot and the Czech footballer from an angle blew the ball into the net.
The homers managed to settle five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of setting drew the win to his side when he successfully finished the break four-on-one.
The damage in the opening second half of the match against Fenerbahce equalled after a 1:1 draw.
Rizespor did not hold the indecisive state for a long time, but it did not have to be hated, because thanks to the results of the rivals he remained three points above the descent belt.
The competition will end Sunday's Basaksehir championship duel at Kasimpasy.
A well-hidden cave by a deserter in the woods near Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor was actually not habitable
In the north of the Czech Republic, in the foothills of the Lu<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ky Mountains, near Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor in <0xC4><0x8C>eskolipská, in the forests that led to Hr<0xC4><0x9B>b<0xC4><0x9B>cí path, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Natural and Artificially Created.
And we're going to walk behind that human hand created.
The place is called Cave by the deserter.
In fact, however, there was never a deserter here, and the cave served as a hiding place, more precisely a shelter chamber, apparently on grain.
The cave is carved from the side to the rocky cave and accessible by the stairs up.
However, it is practically impossible to see until the last moment.
It is revealed by the narrow staircase leading to a rock gallery, from which it is just entering the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is far from human dwellings, at the time of the formation could have been on the hilltop, where today's forest is a field.
"The fact that the building has no window and even a traditional place of heating, clearly demonstrates that no hiker could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podrou<0xC5><0xBE>ek of the Faculty of Philosophy Jana Evangelista Purkyn<0xC4><0x9B> in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem.
A one-story object has only a stone stove in the rear, apparently for dispensing containers.
“I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field,” adds Kamil Podrou<0xC5><0xBE>ek.
On the walls of the cave there are visible traces of tools.
Deflating the sandbox with the top was quite simple and quick for the devotees.
It was enough to properly use the sparks and gradually deflate the sandbox.
Depending on the length of the trail after the tip and the method of cutting at all, the period of formation of the cave can be determined in a framework.
According to historians, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the disorder that occurs in it, there is someone sleeping there in these days.
If you are approaching the cave up from one of the forest roads and you are attracted to the cave by a running slope and a nearby county road, then you will certainly find the path down as well.
And on the way out of the forest, you may still be caught by nearby Havraní rocks.
<0xC5><0xBD>okey Mina<0xC5><0x99>ík is in artificial sleep after heavy fall in Germany
“Filip is in the best hands.
The Institute is set up for similar cases, and fortunately we have a part of the family in Hanover.
This greatly eases the situation and also the care of Finju’s daughter,” the Jezdci.cz server quoted Mina<0xC5><0x99>ík’s wife Katji as saying.
“Everyone is doing their best, Filip now needs time to reconvalesce.
It makes no sense to make any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the problem of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all need to be patient now and give him time,” said the woman of the 45-year-old jockey.
Invited to support the injured Mina<0xC5><0x99>ik on Twitter, star Frankie Dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, equated the legend of Lester Piggott.
Almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70,000 has been collected on the Gofundme server to date.
The target is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000 (2.6 million kronor).
Sassuola scored four goals, losing 0:2
Sassuola's players, though in a Saturday's game in Naples, got the ball four times to the opponent's goal, but eventually had to settle with a 0:2 defeat.
None of their goals was recognized by the referee after consulting with the video for offshoot.
According to the Italian media, this is a record technology failure, so many interventions VAR has never overlooked for one team.
"VAR was more stringent on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him like no other team.
The new technology is breaking records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a comment.
"Festival of the Unknown Goals of Sassuol.
VAR has never been so strict on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to have settled.
However, the goal of Filip Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> was not recognized after the video arbitrator intervened because of the offshoot.
For the same reason, Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>’s other interventions and hits by Francesco Caputa and Domenico Berardi were gradually not paid.
The homers, on the other hand, added another goal.
Electric cars set a new record.
In the Czech Republic, it was the most hit in history.
“Growth drew both a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and a trend of more frequent charging on public stations, as well as an accelerated development of new e-car registrations,” said Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Chmelík, head of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ Clean Technology Department.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla’s electric car manufacturer, but also the Bill and Lidl supermarkets, also reported their market share.
The operator of the classical gas stations is again represented by MOL.
He hasn't got any numbers yet.
“We started building our electric mobility network only last year,” explained company spokeswoman Jana Jusková.
However, the editorial board of the Diary exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric racks operated by the company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
It follows that the drivers picked up an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This is equivalent to the traffic of about 100 kilometres smaller electric cars.
If we miss a small pumping of up to 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of tanking then took place in a free tariff.
If the motorists had already paid for the pickup, their typical loss was around 330 kroner.
E-mobility is mainly in the capital.
In the territory of Prague is located all five of the most difficult trucks of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which by its popularity will also obscure entire regional cities.
Between the regions, Olomouc is slightly visible.
On the contrary, the slightest interest is in remote stations at the border, for example in Bohumín or Prachatic, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than 4,000 electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
Only in the first half of this year, 1274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive survey by the Czechoslovak newspaper, 8% of readers said that they are considering buying an electric car for the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not only for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the government’s steps so far in the protection and recovery of the Czech country and in solving the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called for the state to take a more radical approach.
Events titled Last Drop were attended by representatives of major organizations such as the Spirit Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have people here, for example, who have been opposed to expansion in the Turów mine for a long time, there are people who have been opposed to the mining of gravel at Hungary's Ostroh, there are people who have been opposed to the construction of nonsense dams," she told organizers.
The main demands of the protesters are the creation of a water retention plan in the country, a radical change in agricultural policy and the subsidies system towards promoting sustainable agriculture and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
“The government is to defend the interests of the people, not the careless and devastating business,” she said.
A stand with a petition was placed on Malostranské Square calling on the representatives of the Czech state to set up to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restore the Czech soil and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with passwords such as "End of the dough from the cabbage" or "Less coal, more boats".
Jan <0xC5><0xA0>koda of the Association for People’s Water came from southern Moravia to Prague, protesting against the plan to mine gravel in Hodonínsk.
"It threatens the drinking water supply for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the wells are the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned gravitational excavation is only about 500 meters from the pits, and according to the assessments, the quality of the water is certain to be compromised.
The so-called agroecological farmers came from the village of Vale<0xC4><0x8D> in Karlovy Vary Vojts Vesely.
He pointed out the stakes of small farms that do not care about incomes and profits and supply the inhabitants directly on the spot.
“Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population completely normally, while at the top they do not do such destruction in the form of rural and environmental,” he said.
Three people died in crash of plane into a house in Germany
Three people were killed and two others were injured in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on a residential building in western Germany.
According to local rescue records, two crew members and a resident of the house are likely to be among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, subsequently caused a fire.
The firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
Deputy local fire chief Robert Meyboom said both crew members of the plane had died.
The third victim, according to police, was a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) said in an appeal to Mayor Wesel that she was the mother of a pet whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
In the vicinity of the accident, an emergency slope was found, which apparently served as a brake when landing.
Police say it comes from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The plane took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post newspaper, citing eyewitnesses, said the plane had crashed into a hot air balloon before the crash.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, referring to other witnesses, wrote that the plane crashed in the air before landing.
On Saturday, the Czech savings company mistakenly charged some payments with a card twice.
You have already corrected the error
On Saturday afternoon, the Czech savings company mistakenly charged some payments with a card twice.
According to a spokesman for the bank, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kropík, the problem could have affected thousands of transactions.
She has already eliminated the error and returned the money to her clients.
Problems with double billing of card payments were recorded in the savings room on Saturday afternoon.
“Yesterday (Saturday) night we made a system update and all these duplicate payments were immediately returned to the clients.
At this point, everything is working smoothly,” Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients that the bank deducted money from card payments twice is unknown to the bank’s spokesman, according to his estimates were lower than a thousand transactions.
The causes of the problems can be solved.
“It could be a combination of several factors,” Kropík said.
The Czech savings company is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings facility is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the central and eastern European banking market.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch will introduce a three-degree emergency system against the coronavirus on Monday
"Students will be based on the strength of community dissemination at the regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said in <0xC4><0x8C>T.
These are so-called semaphores, each region will be marked in green, orange or red depending on the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the classification of individual regions.
He admitted that only the Moravian region would have an orange color at the moment and that Prague would be approaching it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at the regional level because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
Water and Caroline
When Jonah and the mill’s daughter Karolínka are caught, it’s not easy at all.
Jonah's father, the ruthless waterman Hastrbuch, is in love with Jonah, and Karolina has no clue that her dear Jonah is not a man.
Fortunately, there is the young Libor, who will do everything to protect the whole, and especially Karolínka, from the waterfall.
What if he's intrigued and lying?
Especially when she is able to dismiss Jonah’s daughter-in-law and give preference to him, Libor.
Soon, it is clear to everyone who can drown in the night of Konvi<0xC4><0x8D>ka, broken flour, fire mill and other lottery.

Most diseases are mild, only 3% of infected people have to go to the hospital.
Either the milder form of the coronavirus is spreading in the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of the sun has significantly improved our immunity.
The infectious departments of hospitals are half-empty, even though the number of infected people is increasing.
“The situation today and in April is completely different, and this is mainly due to the number of hospitalized people,” said Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch, Minister of Health.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of epidemic peaked at us, everyone wore jeans, the army carried out pick-ups, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year in advance.
Ten people die every day.
Today, the daily increase in the number of people infected is higher, but a maximum of two people die every day with COVID-19.
The highest number of infected people per capita is still in Karvinsko, similar numbers are already in Jihlava due to a fire in the local Alzheimer's Center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for seniors was closed by a hygiene centre in <0xC4><0x8C>erno<0xC5><0xBE>ice on Královéhradec.
The disease was confirmed by tests in one of the nurses.
"We travel, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says Martin Schánel, Director of the Pensions Home.
According to him, none of the clients at home have any symptoms yet.
Plane testing will begin by the hygienist tomorrow and then decide on the next action.
Hospitals are also responding to an increase in the number of infected.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will see if people have a patch installed at the entrance.
The record is reported by South Chechnya hygienists, who recorded twenty-five cases of the coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the Prahat company.
In total, there were 131 infected on Saturday – half of Friday’s numbers – but less tests were made on the weekend.
Debuting champion!
Van den Bergh wrote a fairy tale by Anderson
The big surprise of the tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh showed excellent performance even in the fight with the player who won the second most prestigious PDC company in 2018.
The start of the match was balanced on both sides, the evil came in the 8:7 state for the Belgian archer.
Van den Bergh took a break with a 13-shoulder leg and has been on top ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and significantly more experienced "Flying Scots" was hard to get to the doubles.
The way in which the "creator of dreams" had it in his wrist is also evidenced by the fact that the disillusioned Anderson played his first maximum until the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian handled great high checkouts.
The last time he lost in the eleventh leg, in an unfavorable condition, he "catched a large fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson was very frustrated.
Instead, he just launched the arrows and his triumphant competitor made himself completely sovereign.
Van den Bergh transformed the first of three dart games and got his name – he wrote his big dream.
Winning a trophy named after Phil Taylor is much more valuable for the Belgian archer than being his first major.
The last player to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedlá<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
In Nantes, charges fell over the fire of the cathedral, the man confessed
The cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original 16th-century windows and destroyed the ruins.
Investigators have investigated the suspected fire because the fire was proceeding to the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, the police did not find any signs that someone had been brought into the cathedral by violence.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a thirty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without initiating a criminal prosecution.
Now the prosecutor’s office has informed that on the basis of new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faced charges of burning.
If he is found guilty, he will face up to ten years in prison and a high fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the act and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch: On Monday we will introduce "samafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to play the role of a pandemic plan, the absence of which is faced with criticism by the government and the Ministry of Health.
"Students will be based on the strength of community dissemination," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian region or Prague would have reached a medium, orange degree.
The system is designed as a regional one, because the situation in the individual regions varies significantly, he added.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with the Epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS).
At each level, the Minister said, specific measures will be imposed, whether it is the obligation to wear scarves or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
In order to create an epidemiological plan on the Prime Party television program, Interior Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) called on people to have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch commented on this by saying that there is no point in talking about the declaration of a state of emergency or the re-invitation of a crisis staff.
In view of the increasing number of infected since Saturday in the Czech Republic, the government has reintroduced the obligation to wear scarves at internal events for more than 100 people.
As of Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now 1000 people.
The government’s process, when it was not clear at the last minute what measures were being taken and when they would be announced, was criticised.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main actors should create a sense of security on the contrary and compensate for the confusion on the contrary," Senator Marek Hilser said in a statement.
The measures can already vary by region, for example in Prague from Sunday the obligation to wear scarves also in non-residential medical facilities, i.e. in pharmacies or in doctor’s waiting rooms.
The obligation to wear scarves during visits to health and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced since Friday in Liberec and <0xC3><0x9A>stek region.
In the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina region of Jihlavsk it is necessary to wear scarves in indoor public spaces, in MHD and in health facilities from July 14.
On the contrary, anti-epidemia measures have been released in the Moravian Region, as well as in the Central Region of Kutnohorska.
As early as June, the Czech government also approved a so-called semaphore for Europe, which differentiates the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In low- and medium-risk countries, the authorities have not been requiring a negative coronavirus test for Czech citizens since June 15, or quarantine in place.
They are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are now in the low-risk category.
Technoparty in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovska continues.
Playing for a third capacity, she had to finish at noon
Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota (Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko) Technoparty at Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovska continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems are still playing.
According to evening estimates the police remains here after 20:00 about 500 people, the original rough estimates spoke about three hundred, 900 in the morning, police spokeswoman Lucie Novaková said.
Originally, the techno parties were supposed to end on Sunday at noon, during which time part of the music systems actually blurred.
“Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
The music production is still partly ongoing.
We expect that there will be a gradual disconnection and disconnection of music systems,” Novaková said.
“Police officers are still consistently checking out visitors to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the option to undergo a preventive breathing test before leaving," she added.
Dozens of police officers are being supervised, foreign police, traffic and order police are on site, and service dogs are also being escorted to the scene.
"During the day, police checked 470 people on the scene and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were undergoing breath test, six of which were driving under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for narcotic and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police have also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the participants of the technoparty, the police conducted 300 preventive breathing tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene there.
In the Prime Party television program, Interior Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) said this.
However, the number of participants decreased to less than 1,000, so the police assessed that the intervention was not needed, nor was it requested by the hygiene station or the Ministry of Health.
Czech Television (<0xC4><0x8C>T) said on Sunday that technopartys expanded to the surrounding lands, whose owners did not agree with the use for technopartys.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for damages.
Fans of techna at the field near Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota arrived on Friday evening.
Police were initially guarding a field in Bla<0xC5><0xBE>imi, Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovska, where technopartys took place last year.
Bla<0xC5><0xBE>im is located about 30 kilometers from Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota, where the technicians eventually actually sat.
According to Novákova, no one came to Blazhimi.
Snake-sniffing: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
“This year’s first case was recorded in <0xC5><0xBD>eleznorudsk.
The snake bit a girl in the leg, a 2010 year-old who was taken by her parents to the local emergency service base," the regional health service spokeswoman Mária Svobodova said in a statement, after which the child was taken to the hospital in Klatove.
Snakes are the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in <0xC5><0xA0>umava that these animals are present in a higher number, so it is good to pay attention when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that the snake will catch you isn't too high, she's afraid of herself in regular contact.
And if he has room for it, he likes to walk away for loud sucking.
It attacks only if it feels very threatened – for example, if you accidentally crawl on it.
However, it is not a tragedy, even if its poison is very effective against small mammals, but humans will not die.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
Thus, the risk of hazards is primarily for children, seniors and allergens.
"A person often has a feeling of vomiting, sweating, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in weakened individuals and especially allergies, can come up with an anaphylactic shock," she told the Daily Miriam Kladmok.
The man threatened to throw the babies out of the window.
After the policeman licked wine and threw dishes
After 23:00, an intervention unit entered the apartment and the man was detained.
The co-workers were immediately taken care of by healthcare professionals, regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, after the police negotiator threw dishes, knives or sucked it out of the window with wine.
He reinforced his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning off the window with the child in his arms.
He even went out on the windowsill, where he crawled.
The police are investigating the man.
No further information is yet to be published.
Daughter prefers to play tennis before the season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will no longer be involved in the coronavirus-affected season this year.
Sixty-six-year-old US Open champion, who became a mother in June, but still does not want to end her career.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Two weeks ago, Stosur announced on social media that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to a daughter Genevieve in mid-June.
"I will stay home, spend time with my family, be with all the little milestones that our Evie will experience over the next six months and just enjoy it," the former world leader said in a statement on the Australian Union website.
The WTA Tour will resume the suspended season on 3 August at the Palermo Antuk Tournament.
Sapa Market: Razie reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles riding into the site transported 1,320 pieces of turkey eggs of unknown origin, in addition to inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the sanitation plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
The inspection of the live fish stand then found that the seller does not have proof of the origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a veterinary problem in the long run.
For example, in the autumn of last year, veterinarians discovered an illegal grocery store, there were almost half a ton of unmarked foods without proof of origin.
In most cases, the date of consumption was not determined, some products had a long shelf life and were corrupted.
For five kilograms of sepia, the shelf life was exceeded by three years.
In May last year, veterinarians and police officers arrested 80 kilograms of food without origin documents, including dried fish, olives or frozen beets, some of which were mold.
Putin phoned Zelensky before the start of the Donbas ceasefire, the Kremlin criticises the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin telephoned his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbass, where a new truce is to begin at midnight.
According to the Kremlin, Putin has criticized the Ukrainian parliament’s decision to hold local elections; Kiev has reportedly called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
Negotiators from Ukraine and Russia agreed on a new ceasefire on Wednesday evening to support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The truce is to begin after midnight on Monday night, to be “complete and general” and to pave the way for further provisions of peace agreements.
Putin told Zelensky that the Ukrainian parliament’s decision to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine's parliament last week decided that the elections to local representatives will not be held in the territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement assumes that Kiev will regain control of the border of Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after giving these regions broad autonomy and organising local elections there.
The Green Office said both states agreed on the benefits of the upcoming Donbas ceasefire and on the need to take further measures to support peace in the region, such as deterring combat areas or withdrawing some of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied peninsula of Crimea and Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped halt the fighting, but in occasional shootings and artillery attacks on both sides of the front, people continue to die.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed more than 14,000 deaths since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support from the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made the end of the Donbass war his priority, but a more fundamental breakthrough in the negotiations has not yet been achieved.
The unexpected master in decimal is Rykl, the seventh ruler of the New
Advocate of the last two titles Dole<0xC5><0xBE>ag did not run to the end of Saturday's four-man program, Kopeck<0xC3><0xBD> did not jump the base in the bar on Sunday.
The ten-year-old was ruled by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing for the group coach Josef Karase, but resigned after the disc.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the M<0xC4><0x8C>R so far, this time he was the only ten-man to get over the seven thousand mark.
Other medals were won by Vilem Strask<0xC3><0xBD> and Petr Urbánek.
Rykl after the competition recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í S<0xC3><0xBD>kora.
“It’s a shame that there weren’t guys here and Kope didn’t set up because that would look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I appreciate most of all the fact that I gave myself a character about 30 centimeters away.
Then I was still pleased with the stick and the most disappointed about the disc, I was under-average there,” he said on Facebook.
On the first day of the seventh round, she won with more than a hundred-dollar dominance by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cache, despite being hurt by an injured ankle on her reflex leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she recorded only 570 cm, did not exceed 40 metres in length, and did not enter the final octagon.
Novotná scored 5878 points and won 241 points ahead of Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Dvo<0xC5><0x99>áková.
The distance was above all, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
“I wish it was around the 630s.
“Yesterday, I started to get bored, but I’m very happy that I didn’t feel it at all and that it didn’t limit me at all,” Novotná said on Facebook.
Bio LPG arrives in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or oil, given a significantly lower consumption tax, but its advantage is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer.
Like gasoline and petrol, it also has its eco-friendly variant - "bio LPG".
But this is a whole new thing - the European market was first presented and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to the press release of the Czech Association of LPG.
"In these days, we have received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our gas stations in combination with classical fossil LPG," said Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Karlík from Primagas.
Bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically similar to the classic petroleum LPG that many motorists are now tanking in their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions arbitrarily.
“The only difference from the classic LPG is the production method,” says about bio LPG Ivan Indrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, president of the association.
This is said to be one of the major advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and also the distribution infrastructure is relatively good, for example compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced targetedly, for example, from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
On the other hand, classical petroleum LPG is formed partly as a by-product of oil refining, partly by separation in the extraction of natural gas.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, the car is 40-70% more eco-efficient in terms of carbon footprint than the petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
It is not about CO2 emissions from the car’s exhaust, but about the ecology of fuel production, that is, the so-called “well-to-tank” part (Czech for “from source to tank”).
One of the largest bio LPG producers currently includes the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M), Unipetrol is also considering the possibility of production in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to estimates of the association in the Czech Republic about 170,000 vehicles drive on LPG; the Ministry of the Environment indicates in the NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M a slightly higher number, about 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transportation, almost 6,000 LPG-powered cars were rebuilt last year alone.
LPG refueling is possible in the Czech Republic at approximately 950 stations of different operators.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch reviewed the number of infected, the number decreased by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for ANO) ordered the ministry to revise the numbers of people infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published by the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
The number on Sunday afternoon dropped from Saturday's 5254 cases to 3479, which is about 1,775 fewer infected.
Currently, there are 3,422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"With the increase in the number of cured, there is a revision of data, which the hygiene department has not recently tried to update," said Jaroslav Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had been infected with the coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 recovered and 371 cases of Covid-19 had been reported.
Mobile electoral units or correspondence choices.
Politologist and sociologist looking for variants for the pandemic
In order for people in quarantine to vote for the coronavirus in the October regional and senate elections, Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (CSSD) said the law needed to be amended.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated mode.
He said it on Sunday in the Prime TV Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties at the Ministry.
“Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law,” Hama<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find solutions within the framework of current legal rules.
However, the minister said it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in the quarantine cannot vote because of their health condition.
Voting bans should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said in OVM that the possibility of correspondence elections has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then counts with its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather include other types of parties) of correspondence choices to be overvalued.
Personally, they are against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klima said that it is now necessary to come up with ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out this year and with as little health risk as possible.
He then considers to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
The choice of correspondence (either abroad or in the Czech Republic) is considered one of the functional methods.
As another, they see the aforementioned electoral units or, for example, the possibility of a deputy vote within the family.
He added that it is an opportunity to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of the coronavirus - were solved in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavirus, various types of elections have already been postponed in 67 countries this year.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pig Ears Throwed Protesters on Government Building
Participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojk Borisov and his cabinet were throwing pig ears at the government building.
This was another of a series of protests against the "mafian style of governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning a mid-state blockade, the DPA said.
Today’s protest, which took place on the 18th day in a row, was weaker than the previous one, according to Radio Svobodná Europa/Radio Svoboda.
At 20:00, about 300 people were killed, some streets had to be closed for traffic.
Protesters in front of the government building played a theatrical scene in which they symbolically locked in the prison cell of Prime Minister Borisov and Attorney General Ivan Ge<0xC5><0xA1>ev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the government.
The resignation of both is one of the main demands of the protesters.
They also called for the abolition of the declared health reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
Protest organizer Nikolai Hadjigenov said on public radio on Wednesday that a “peak of escalation” in the form of “international demonstrations in Sofia and blockades across the country” was about to take place.
He reiterated the demand for Borisov's and his government's resignation, as well as the cancellation of early elections.
The correct ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov said earlier that he had no intention of resigning.
This was due, among other things, to the need for Bulgaria to carry out the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he exchanged five members of his government team, although the resignation of the protesters did not calm down.
Earlier this week, Borisov’s government stopped voting in parliament on confidence in parliament.
Trainer Boloni Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x8D> no longer wants matches without spectators
Football coach Boloni Sini<0xC5><0xA1>a Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x8D> already has enough Italian league games without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
“What we’re doing right now isn’t football.
I've got a lot of games without spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotions, no joy.
Those games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don’t think I’m the only one who thinks so,” Mikhailovich said before today’s match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, the Serie A matches are followed in a quick track, and although they are played until the evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible heat.
Under such conditions, he doesn’t even know how the teams are.
Let's finish this season.
These measures had to be taken to keep the competition going, but I hope that fans will be back from September,” said the coach, who in the past led either Fiorentina or AC Milan.
For Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x87>, this season is unusual because he was missing four months on the bench due to the treatment of leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the disruption of the league and everything else, our team managed to move to a higher level.
“We want to continue to grow and we need players to be mentally stronger,” he said.
We have become the target of a cyber attack by foreign states, Iran says
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials said the fire that broke out in Natanz’s underground nuclear operation this month could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Musavi told reporters that the Islamic Republic’s infrastructure is facing “thousands of cyberattacks” every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them can be refuted.
In recent months, according to Musávi, several broader cyberattacks have been recorded, behind which, according to the analysis, were "certain governments and groups".
However, he did not provide further details on the possible offenders, according to Reuters.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran’s state agency IRNA this month reported that Iran’s enemies, such as Israel and the United States, could have been behind recent incidents.
None of these countries, however, were directly accused of the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-term tensions between the two countries worsened in 2018 after Washington resigned from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a hard effect on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Kasem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
On January 8, Iran fired a number of missiles at bases in Iraq, where the U.S. operates.
The U.S. has admitted that dozens of U.S. troops have been wounded.
Israel considers Iran its main enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended production stop until May 25th.
Toyota Peugeot Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n Automobile (TPCA) in Cologne has again extended production stops due to the coronavirus.
The production lines are expected to re-launch on Monday morning, May 25.
The race will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, said automotive spokesman Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paroubek.
Production has been costly due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally planned to renew it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension of the stop is, according to Paroubka, the borders are closed and the dealership is closed, so no one has to sell the cars.
According to Paroubka, the company will produce 100 percent from the start, i.e. for two shifts.
The coronavirus has hit key markets of the company, such as Italy, the UK or Spain.
Mayor Michael Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par (Change for Cologne) said the production cessation in TPCA is not a signatory for life in the city.
"In the beginning it was known, it was empty in the city.
But gradually the streets are filled, especially now since Monday, when it has been loosened a lot.
So the city is full,” said Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who have stayed in hostels.
"In those two months, we didn't have to solve almost any problem," Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par said.
For example, <0xC5><0xA0>koda Auto, which also stopped production due to the coronavirus crisis, reopened it on Monday, April 27 at all three of its production facilities in the Czech Republic.
None of the races operate at 100 percent capacity.
The restoration of production in <0xC5><0xA0>koda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, a third, i.e. night shift, took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the restoration of production.
TPCA currently employs approximately 2,500 people and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time an employer in Cologne.
Cancer Kills Bride Shortly After Wedding: Leaves a Message to Family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson struggled with cancer, and when it seemed that she had defeated the cancer, the disease returned.
A thirty-nine-year-old woman, who loved bodybuilding, eventually ended up on a bed in a hospice, where she still had enough to take her lifelong love.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to impotence.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With her friend Ricky Moore, with whom she had lived for more than 16 years, they travelled around the world.
Nine-year-old woman exercised and lived healthy, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope that she would recover.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma managed to overcome the cancer, however, in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time the spine attacked.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to the British Daily Mirror, underwent a 10-hour spine surgery and later resumed drastic treatment.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her thirty-nineth birthday, doctors announced that she had a few months left to live.
In April, the beautiful blonde finally decided to go to the pub in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged for her a wedding with her lover Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky last took Gemma to the restaurant for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, a post Gema wrote for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this has been published, it means that I've finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will have a broken heart to leave my loved ones here, I will be so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can’t thank enough Ricky, who was on my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time,” she wrote on social media, saying that pain and suffering had finally stopped and she found peace.
“I’m also grateful for all the support I’ve received from all my social media followers,” she wrote, adding that everyone should appreciate their life and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell travel dating, mushroom and pexeo amulet
For a hundred crowns he will get the forthcoming pocket work mostly of Czech beginners.
Images and other creations create directly for the artmat, in advance they know that they need to fit in sizes of 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"In the package is always a curator text about the artist and then the work itself," said project curator Petra Wid<0xC5><0xBE>ová.
Artmat works on the principle of coincidence.
The buyer can be surprised at what kind of artwork he will get.
Currently, he can become the new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexandra <0xC5><0xA0>toplová or mini-views by Theresa Bonaventure, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23, in collaboration with Dora Dutkova, prepared a pexesis related to the Prague Walk.
Cards should be paired with home signage.
Ilona Polanski created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Julián Chomová sell a pocket pack of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from the trio and a fairy card, the second series of illustrations based on her comic Spiritistics.
Healthcare salaries will grow by up to 5% next year.
The increase is unrealistic according to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch
Healthcare salaries could grow by as high as 5% next year, Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for ANO) said in Questions of Václav Moravce in Czech TV.
The trade unions’ demand for an increase of up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protection aid.
The hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think the increase (in wages) could be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect on the current situation in which he has intervened since March in the selection of the coronavirus insurance pandemic and the government regulation against its spread.
Income from the insurance company declined at the time.
“I think the increase of 15 percent is unrealistic at this point,” Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
The average monthly earnings of doctors in acute bed care according to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS) are likely to reach 88,312 SEK this year, with nurses 47,498 SEK.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to 7,000 crowns.
The <0xC3><0x9A>ZIS data also shows that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic in 2019 according to the data of the Czech Statistical Office was CZK 34,125.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would require a minimum increase of 10 percent for 2021, ideally 15 percent.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in public hospitals, which must be governed by wage tables, and contract salaries in hospitals in cities, counties or private ones.
They therefore also require that the salary tables be uniform for health care professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to 7,000 crowns per month.
For example, in the case of doctors, wages grew faster than wages last year.
According to the President of the Czech Chamber of Dentistry Roman <0xC5><0xA0>mucler, trade unions should see how the state is doing.
Recently, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic, the House approved an increase in this year’s state budget deficit to a record <0x24>500 billion, of which <0x24>1.75 billion is to go to health care workers’ salaries in hospitals and social services.
According to <0xC5><0xA0>mucler, the Board of Healthcare Providers disagrees with the salary increases in the coming year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and health facilities themselves, and the money should be passed to them through a salary statement.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch also said that the hospitals currently have enough protective aid.
Pavel <0xC5><0xA0>vagr, President of the Administration of State Material Reserves (SSHR), said this week that the administration currently does not have any protective health aid.
Waiting for the completion of the selection process.
According to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were purchased.
The state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies as well.
They could take over the quarantine with the smart grenade.
We are ready, they report.
“The smart quarantine works, there’s something to improve, of course.
We'll discuss that with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly, and the question is whether they should run the whole thing again," the prime minister said on his Facebook page on Sunday.
According to him, IT systems and hygiene stations cannot be sufficiently connected, which must gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister, in the Moravian region, where they are one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he had no information on Sunday’s talks and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The military is ready for this step, he said.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
By that time, the intelligent quarantine was led by a ninety-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body of the government, led by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
On Sunday, Interior Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) criticized the project.
He also insisted that he could be captured again by the army.
The shortcomings in the project were previously acknowledged by Vladimír Dzurilla, the governmental commissioner for IT and digitalization, who is in charge of the project.
“The system works, but it’s still working on it.
Twenty years ago it was independent and non-systematic, now we are trying to unite it within a few months.
It's not gonna work.
People behind bars, poor people on hygiene behind bars adapt these new systems and actually catch those mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura will not be nominated again, because he does not want to "disappear in politics"
The current Ostrava Mayor Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Macura (ANO) will not be nominated in the upcoming municipal elections.
The reason is the attempt to "do not be fooled in politics," he told the server Respect.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO Presidency, has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the candidate led by the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost a third of the vote.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I would last one term and with that experience from the business, I can turn it all around and put it on my feet for a while," he told Respekt.
He added that he had been persuaded to some extent for the second term.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don’t want to be a fool in politics,” Macura added, who in an interview described himself as a heavy introvert who doesn’t like frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, it has been speculating for a long time about Macuru’s possible end in the Yes movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the YES movement, for example for its alliance with the SPD or for the support of Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few personalities, he supported Zeman’s opponent Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Draho<0xC5><0xA1> in the election.
With the YES movement, which he joined in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
“As long as I have the feeling that I can change something in the movement, that it’s not a completely useless fight, and that no one gets into it, I don’t have an immediate motive to end it,” he said.
Sixty-six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Prior to becoming the mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served, among other things, as the director of the manufacturer of Walmark Pharmaceuticals.
He also worked in other companies.
Uber returns to Brno to offer transport services
Uber will return to Brno at the end of July, which offers transportation services.
This is the result of a change in the law, said on Thursday in a press release of Brno City Council for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS).
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as labels such as taxi or taxi.
However, the change in the law has changed the conditions for the operation of conventional and alternative taxis since July.
Kratochvíl has held several talks with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July of this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows this company to legally operate its business.
The city has been familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him for not designating vehicles as a taxi or a missing taximeter.
The court has issued a preliminary measure banning Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year Mayor Markéta Va<0xC5><0x88>ková (ODS) said the city would like to take steps to get Uber to operate in Brno.
According to later court rulings, Uber was able to drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
He will now return on the basis of a change of law.
As of July, in addition to classic taxis with lights and a taximeter, it is easier to operate the transport service ordered and paid exclusively via the mobile app.
Too buzzing celebration in Brno: a flying chair hit a meter from a man on a pedestrian
On the fourth floor of the apartment, an office chair flew out in Brno on Saturday evening and fell about a meter from the pedestrian.
At that moment, a pedestrian followed him, who immediately called the guards.
As soon as she arrived at this address in the western part of the city, she noticed an open window, under which she still lay a chair, and next to it several cans and stools.
"The smoke that came from the room on the fourth floor indicated that there was a fairly noisy celebration inside.
The guards went out through the hallway to the apartment and asked three young men present from the age of twenty-six to twenty-nine years for an explanation," said Jakub Ghanem, a spokesman for the police.
Request for appeal Rafah discusses Babi<0xC5><0xA1> with <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO) plans on Monday to discuss the request for the revocation of the head of the Antitrust Office (UOHS) Petr Rafaje with the coalition social democrats.
Non-profit organizations called for the appeal of Rafah to negotiate the anti-corruption council of the government, as well as <0xC3><0x9A>stek<0xC3><0xBD> kraj.
Social democrats say the exchange of offices is in place.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>TK, Rafah was not invited to the government office on Monday.
His second term ends in the middle of next year, he cannot be appointed a third by law.
His resignation lies in the competence of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman.
In addition to the challenge of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the <0xC3><0x9A>stek region.
The reason for this is, among other things, Rafa’s recent case.
Last week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he would be familiar with the material and that the government parties would take "any opinion" on it.
He also said that the challenge had not yet been negotiated with the president, and he has no meeting with him in the near future.
According to <0xC3><0x9A>OHS, there is no reason to appeal because Rafaj was not accused of anything.
The servers IHNED.cz and Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz last week wrote that the police were interested in Rafah’s meeting with the hajtman Ji<0xC5><0x99>im Cunke.
The meetings have been linked, among other things, to the decision to compete for the project, by the controversial new Zlín hospital for eight billion, which Cunek strongly promotes.
The Senate said the meeting was jointly addressed by the Senate’s “activities.”
Rafael speaks the same way.
The representative of the <0xC3><0x96>stek region called on the government to recall Rafah at the end of June.
It also calls for reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Authority.
The decision of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS on public procurement according to Jaroslav Komínka’s transport operator is not transparent and has arbitrary characteristics.
In March last year, police raided the anti-monopoly office because of a bid to pick a fine.
This year, in June, the server Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz warned that Rafaj is using apartments written on the company of the influential backyard player <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Alexandra <0xC4><0x8C>ubi.
However, a 3.5 million deposit for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafayev’s account.
The President of the Office for the Protection of Competition has been Rafah since 9 July 2009, and for the second term the President of the former Member of Social Democracy was appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafa’s second six-year term will expire.
The Anti-Monopoly Office Act states that the President may appeal to the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may only be revoked if it does not exercise its function for more than six months or seriously affects the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.

The new technology will cost <0x24>740,000 and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in the center of Blanska on a regular basis.
During the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to survive.
There was a lot of warmth and bad air.
The ventilation didn't help.
That’s why I like air conditioning,” said one of the readers of Blanes, Petr Novotn<0xC3><0xBD>.
According to the director of the library, Lukas Dlapy, the temperatures in the building often rose by more than thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glazed and acts as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, thanks to the curvature of the building, the sun rests much of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem for the individual department to clear, because overnight, for security reasons, the window must be closed.
Often we have been in the library at thirty degrees from the morning,” Dlapa said.
The worst of it was the studio and the reading room on the third floor.
And on the floor above the exhibition room and the director's office.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
“Sometimes it happened that librarians collapsed at work and ended up in incapacity to work.
The problem also occurred regularly in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, she couldn’t breathe anymore,” Dlapa noted.
Initially, the city’s representatives wanted to do air conditioning in all the premises of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three out of five.
“Due to limited funding, air conditioning will only have the most problematic areas.
Studio and reading room on the third floor.
Next, the cultural room and the children's department on the floor above," Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Svoboda of the Blanenské investment department reported.
He added that in the first phase, the workers already installed air technology in the aforementioned premises in the autumn last year and adjusted the electrical installation.
Approximately 360 thousand crowns.
The Blansko City Library has at least 3,000 registered readers.
That's about nine hundred to fifteen years old.
The Chicago Resistance has eliminated the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game
Not all of the infected athletes will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players, who are silent as a grave about the health of the players and don’t publish anything at all.
He was one of the few in the Crawford series.
The 35-year-old from Montreal was only present at the first training session, since then missing in the assembly.
"I would like to inform all of you that I have been tested positive for Covid-19 and that's why I've spent the last fourteen days locked up in my house," he said.
Fans don’t have to worry about their health anymore.
Crawford is ready to throw again into full load.
“It’s amazing that I’m back.
I will do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible,” he added.
The experienced goalkeeper has won two Stanley Cups with Chicage, a permanent part of the goalkeeper's already for the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks are first awaiting a preparatory duel with St. Louis, after which they will face Edmonton in the foreground.
Thousands of people protested in Israel against the Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deals with the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place in front of Netanyahu’s private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv have been taking place regularly for several weeks.
Its participants are demanding Netanyahu’s resignation because of the process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government is addressing the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one of the protesters wrote on his poster, referring to Netanyahu's commonly known nickname.
“Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his dress,” he said.
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is Israel’s first prime minister sentenced in office.
He is charged with three charges of corruption, fraud and misuse of trust.
He rejects all accusations and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial can take up to three years, with more than 300 witnesses being called.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in Israel, which has about nine million inhabitants, in at least 60,500 people.
455 people have died in connection with the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced a quarantine measure to help reduce the daily rise of infected people.
After the gradual release of restrictions since the end of April, however, especially in late June, the number of infected people began to grow again significantly.
Netanyahu’s critics claim that the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, traders affected by quarantine measures.
Protesters are also disturbed by the fact that the government is issuing conflicting directions in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver broke the car over the tree and died.
Firefighters had to cut the body out of the wreck
The tragic accident occurred around 23:00 at Neveklov in the narrow district leading from Slapska Prehrada.
The driver apparently flew down the woods at a slow pace and broke the car against a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be removed from the wreck by firefighters, inter alia, cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are checked by the police.
They ordered a court hearing to clarify, among other things, whether the man was not driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
The end of wasting and wrapping one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is committed to a fundamental change in the strategy.
He cancels the discounts and no longer wants to scratch one collection after the other.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the biggest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
This means that billions of clothes end each year in combustion chambers and depots.
The view of slow fashion, often despised approach to dressing, but has changed relatively quickly in recent years.
Approximately half of the goods Pietro Filipi sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, will simply not buy.
The company does not want to scratch one collection after the other and at the end of each season to discount products below their production price.
In addition, according to owner Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka, the era of new and old collections and blind follow-up is rapidly changing fashion trends.
"Most merchants with discounts already count when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it’s actually a bit of a scam,” says owner Pietro Filipi Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
In addition, with its approach, the company also wants to support local businesses.
"Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothing that is overtime and overseas.
Globally, the segment of premium brands is typical of the absence of any discount, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is therefore not necessary," Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka adds.
The giant graffiti depicts the RAF pilot Kurt Taussig
“The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal liked the city leadership," said Vácek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
It consumed about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-<0xC5><0xA0>anov.
He left town at the age of 15.
During the wars, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis drove him to an internment camp, where they held him for several weeks.
He and his brother, however, managed to avoid the concentration camp through Nicholas Winton's organization.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in the United Kingdom, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later underwent pilot training in South Africa and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Samet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times and his native Teplice, which gave him an honorary citizenship.
Kamil Vacek, sixty-year-old, known by people in the street graphic arts industry under the nickname of Camo, has been working sprays on hot streets for over 20 years.
The graffiti began on the surfaces that the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) had designated for these purposes.
Hurricane Hanna Arrives on the Coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwestern coast of the U.S. state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight).
Invaded the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometres north of Port Mansfield, and weakened in a tropical storm while moving over the mainland.
However, according to meteorologists, it poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it strong winds and intense precipitation; along with local floods, electricity outages and various material damages, including damaged ships, have been reported, according to AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Saturday declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwestern Texas and recommended a voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warnings were given by people from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and the bay of Mesquite Bay, but it has survived to reach nearly 500 kilometres in length before moving gradually over northeastern Mexico.
"While Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rises in levels, a dangerous hurricane and a single tornado can pose a threat," the National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning local time (afternoon SEL<0xC4><0x8C>) the storm was moving in the area of the U.S.-Mexican border and accompanied by a wind at a speed of 85 kilometers per hour.
On Saturday, Hanna became the first hurricane of this year’s hurricane season in the Atlantic.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, a wind of up to 145 kilometres per hour accompanied it, but it gradually weakened to 112 kilometres per hour as it progressed to the mainland, leaving Hanna again out of the hurricane category.
Local authorities urged local residents to overtake the storms at home without forgetting the hygiene measures related to the prevention of the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the countries in the U.S. that suffers the most from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Due to the existing safety measures and the need to comply with distances, evacuations are also a major challenge.
Provisional shelters have been opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who had a positive coronavirus test or were otherwise exposed to an infection.
Local authorities have called on all evacuees to take their claws and disinfectant gels to the shelter if possible.
“We don’t have that far behind us yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding,” said Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Meteorological Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts say that in some places, up to 300 millimetres of precipitation could spread in a matter of hours, in some cases less than 500 millimetres, which could flood a number of coastal settlements along with a rise in sea level.
Zeman lends general rank to Colonel Lipkov
On Wednesday, President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman lends the general rank to Colonel Pavlo Lipko.
This comes from the overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The lease of Brigadier General is due to the August appointment of Lipka to the post of commander of the Alliance Multinational Division in northeastern Poland.
Lipka still serves as the deputy commander of the Czech Army ground forces.
Zeman's promotion was proposed by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, July will replace brigadier General Karl <0xC5><0x98>ehku as the deputy commander of the multinational division of the northeast in Poland’s Elblag, which will command allied units of presence in Poland and the Baltics.
<0xC5><0x98>ehka became Director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NUKIB) in March.
The government proposed to the president to lend Lipka the rank of brigadier general.
According to the Act on the Soldiers of the Occupation, a higher grade may be lent to a soldier for the duration of the appointed function or for the duration of a service assignment which requires the lending of a higher grade.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Allied Division shall be held by the General Staff.
The soldier to whom the title has been lent has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that title.
However, it does not have the right to adjust the salary corresponding to that value.
The leasing of the value lasts until the reason for which it was granted it is omitted.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a model for his subordinates.
It will play a significant role in carrying out the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June.
Wednesday promotion will take place at 12:30 in Prague Castle, with the participation of Minister of Defence Lubomir Metnar or Chief of Staff Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
EU countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is the adherence to the distance or the wearing of velcros on the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats on the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
It was reported by Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport added that the agreement was signed by officials and that it still needs to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from six years of age, to comply with the recommended distance during security checks and take-off at the airport.
Airplanes must also have sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
The airline will also be able to hold mid-seat seats.
The common rules agreed by officials shall at least comply with some of the requirements of the air carriers.
Differences in standards have caused confusion.
In the Arctic <0xC5><0xA0>picberká fell the temperature record, measured there almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, surpassing the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees Celsius.
About two thousand years old Longyearbyen is the largest city in the <0xC5><0xA0>picberlands, located about 1300 kilometers from the north pole.
Spiders warm up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other parts of the Arctic – from Alaska to Siberia, the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies said in a report last year.
According to him, the average temperature in <0xC5><0xA0>picberká has increased by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it could even rise by ten degrees if greenhouse gases are not lowered into the atmosphere.
The rise in temperature in <0xC5><0xA0>picberkák can result in permanently frozen soil melting, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can cause more lava and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens the Arctic fauna, such as ice bears or turtles, which depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
Britons returning from Spain are waiting for mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential routes to mainland Spain due to the risk of spread of COVID-19.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people must remain in isolation for two weeks.
The new rules will enter into force at midnight.
“Protection of public health is our top priority.
"We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British diplomacy said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a certain country from the list of safe ones," she added.
According to the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations in the world.
The British, among other things, have concerns about whether they will be paid sick leave if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from vacation.
For example, Neil Hunter from the city of Sittingbourne booked a ten-day holiday in Lanzarote, they were supposed to take off on Tuesday.
The tour has been booked since December.
“We were supposed to go with the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don’t know what’s going to happen.
“I am working as a driver and I don’t think my employer will agree that I will be in quarantine for two weeks after I return from my vacation,” he said.
With regard to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of epidemic.
Over the past two days there have always been more than 900 new infected in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example, Catalonia is trying to curb all nightlife, preventing people from meeting in a big meeting.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently highlighted the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, Basque Country and the region of Madrid.
Dukovan Electricity Purchase Model Discussed by Government
The government on Monday will discuss a model for the acquisition of electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill expects that, if the purchase price is higher than the price of electricity in the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek (for ANO) and the energy company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ said earlier that the more likely option is that people will save for electricity thanks to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as developments in the past have shown several times.
In the past, environmental organizations have criticized the plan.
“The buy-in price can be both below the market price of power electricity and above it.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers by the size of the fuselage - at lower consumption or by electricity consumption - at higher consumption of electricity," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the material statement.
Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people at Dukovan construction are earning.
Otherwise, the impact will be in dozens of crowns per family per year, which he says is far less than people pay annually in electricity bills to support so-called subsidized resources.
He had previously estimated that the price of redemption could range from 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal for the amount, it is to be included only in the acquisition contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, which is currently the most stockpiled by traders, is currently around 45 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"With the difference in the purchase price and the market price of power electricity of ten euros, the average household could pay a surcharge with the consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to four-member households, not standardly equipped with electric appliances, but not 100 hoods, which can be used in three hoods and electric boilers.
“We are living in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be an explicitly speculative issue," said Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Voltr, CEO of the Energy financial group.
The proposed law is based on the fact that the redemption would be carried out by the MPO and by the legal person entrusted to it, respectively, owned by the State, at a pre-established price.
The contract between the investor and the State, which guarantees the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, including repeated, but not longer, until the end of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production design defines the generation of electricity with a nuclear reactor connected to an electrical system with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek said earlier that the new Dukovan block should have a capacity of 1,200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity a year, which would correspond to a dozen expected Czech consumption.
The block is expected to be put into operation by 2036.
The financing model for the new Dukova bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the state in construction without interest, with a 2% interest on operation.
The opposition does not agree with the financing model, it is also bothered by the possibility that Dukovany would be built by Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should have a 70% stake in the construction.
The rest should be paid by <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which will also pay all possible additional costs.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ CEO Daniel Bene<0xC5><0xA1> said in May <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the expected amount for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion kronor).
The agreements between the state and the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ on the construction of the new Dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development downloaded <0x24>2 billion in support of tourism in the media
The material, according to which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend in the media, on the internet and billboards for advertising for holidays in the Czech Republic of two billion kroner, has been withdrawn from the commentary process.
Minister Klára Dostálóvá (for ANO) told SeznamZhrávy.cz that the material is still working.
On the document in eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) the server Zdopravya.cz warned on Friday.
The ministry has justified the plan for the collapse of tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, revenues and media declined.
The proposal sparked criticism from the opposition as well as representatives of tourism.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give through the CzechTourism government agency money for advertising on television, radio, press, on the Internet, billboards or on stations.
The bulk of the money, 700 million kroner, would get television.
Most of the time, they would get private TV Nova and Prima.
Printed newspapers and weekly newspapers would receive <0x24>400 million, and the same part would be given to MMR for PR articles, banners and videos on websites.
Broadcasting stations would receive <0x24>350 million for the media campaign, most of them private stations again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED displays and surfaces at stations or in the metro.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was to start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still being worked on, definitely not in the form that should be presented yet," Dostálóvá said without further details on the list of servers.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media would benefit from the advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this outrageous humiliation will get in the fall of the election an eye-catching blow," she wrote on Twitter.
The recipient refuses that it is actually about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It can be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she said Friday.
The budget, he said, is two billion indicators.
“Of course we’re still counting it, it can be less and more.
It’s a work material,” she added.
The initiative Save Tourism does not make sense for the media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
“We want two billion for companies in tourism, not an unnecessary advertising campaign,” President Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Bar<0xC4><0x8D>ík said on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should be directed at companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
Life's gone, beer's cock, and death's like a stem of grass
Post-mortem is also the third album entitled A Death is the grass stalk of the Brno poet, a tireless organiser of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Fri<0xC4><0x8D>a, who also left the year before, May 24.
In Fri<0xC4><0x8D>ov’s discography, it is the fifth item and, like the previous titles, here the main emphasis is on Fri<0xC4><0x8D>ov’s poetry, which is an excellent interpreter himself.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>, 1949, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration was passionate about his own, personalized experiences as well as very inner expressions of faith.
However, some agitation was removed from the crowd, when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, totally tolerant.
In this context, Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast, for example, to Jan Zagardní<0xC4><0x8D>ka) attacks me, the champions prominence.
The Fri<0xC4><0x8D>o album offers recordings of author reading from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who have always accompanied her very sensitively, whether it was violinist Josef Kl<0xC4><0x8D>, or Honza Barto<0xC5><0x88> and Ví<0xC4><0x9B>zslav Holata.
I will help - I like - the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka about Fri<0xC4><0x8D>ová's long poetic poems.
"It sent a proud and endless bitterness from them," writes Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka, "over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
The world, which is increasingly falling into the submerged vanity of consumption and concupiscence, is increasingly moving away from what his soul was created from – from the mystery of faith, humility, and human closeness.
There was in them a narrowness of one who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest, but who also knows that they cannot be discarded only because of the general interest.
These poems reminded that a man may have to lose everything expensive, but it is not unimportant how he loses it.
If he sells himself to general bankruptcy, he is skeptical of resignation, he is frightened of silence, or he remains until the last minute in a quiet and proud insistence on what he believes and loves.
“He’s not my adviser,” Hama<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
Former CSSD Prime Minister and President Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek is not a paid social-democracy advisor.
The party president and interior minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek said this on the Prime Party television show today.
Paroubek should be Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s advisor, the server SeznamZrá<0xC5><0x91>ry.cz reported on Friday.
"We write an essay from time to time, he sends me some material and I read it," Hama<0xC4><0x8D>ek said today.
However, he said it was not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"Sometimes I read his opinion, there's a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MEP Jana <0xC4><0x8C>erno<0xC4><0x8D>ová, Minister said that many ODS members are still "uncovered listening to Václav Klaus' opinions".
He says it's okay because he's an experienced politician and a former party president, which is the case with Paroubka.
The fact that the media are making this affair has marked this year’s cucumber season as a sign.
Server SeznamZb<0xC3><0xA6>rty.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek serves as Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ko’s unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that in the fourth place of the party candidate in the municipality, the former chairman of the cell there Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubka and acted as the vice-president of his party LEV 21.
Hama<0xC4><0x8D>ek said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile jump, it's a cock in the ass, it's a Swedish challenger
The 22-year-old American has the ambition and potential to be one of the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat two years younger Duplantis, he beat her at the NCAA University Association meeting last year.
“We had a battle a year ago, he won, and I was second, and then we did it.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," explains Nilsen, who secured the victory by 5.95 metres.
But Duplantis has been shooting up steeply since then and is currently alone in the highest stalk spheres.
In just twenty years, he became a world record player, this year on February 8 in Torun he overcame a 6.17-meter-high lap, a week later in Glasgow he added another centimeter.
"He jumped six meters at the age of 18 when he finished high school," said his colleague Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
“It was clear that as soon as he reaches out from boy to man, all his potential and talent will be decimated.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to break the world record," he said.
Although Nilsen’s record of success is thinner in knowledge than the one that Duplantis boasts, the American sets similar goals.
He has so far indicated his options at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, in February this year he improved his internal personal record to 5.93 m. In August last year, he won the gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he won 13 world championships and went to the <0xC5><0xA0>america race.
The next milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"It's definitely my priority to get to the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League because you can make a name there," he said.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly lead as well on events such as the Olympics, the World Championships or the Pan-American Games."
However, due to the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, which gives Nilsen and other stickers time to improve.
But will it be enough to recognize Duplantis, who can easily turn a race under five circles into a mere battle for silver?
“Everyone is trying to reach him, but I don’t think it will be possible in the near future,” Nilsen said.
“The boy has been jumping for 16 years and in training he’s got a milestone over all the others.”
And before Tokyo starts in 2021, he will want to increase it further.
The woman has spent hundreds of thousands of the disabled son's pension.
The court awaits her
The money a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve his quality of life.
A woman is threatened with up to eight years in prison for adultery.
Due to his poor health, the court deprived the man of his autonomy and appointed his mother a custodian, who was to manage his son’s money, among other things.
"From mid-November 2013 to January this year, a woman used part of her son's disability pension funds for her needs and prepared him for 440,000 kroner," police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said in a statement that the accused woman had been charged with rape.
According to the court order, the woman set up an account for her son, but she allowed his pension to be sent to her account.
“After paying for the costs associated with the son’s stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to buy vehicles, electrical appliances and household runs,” she said.
That he could not use his son’s money for his needs, the woman admitted.
But she struggled to help them with the payment of family expenses.
“We had problems with our incomes to stretch the course of the household.
We've never bought anything super-standard.
It was always on things that my son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I didn’t know I was committing a crime,” the woman told police.

North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding instruments
The findings from the Chiquihuite Cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 instruments of limestone, including fine blades that could have been used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could have served as tip of scissors or scissors.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the instruments date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
“There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the lead author of one of two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments reach the age of 12,500 years.
According to experts, people in the Chiquihuite Cave, located at high altitudes, lived for 20,000 years.
So far, a widely accepted theory has been that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the mainland bridge from present-day Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spikes used to kill mammals and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Clovis culture has subsequently spread to much of North America.
This model, however, has received cracks in the last decades when several ancient settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, writes about 42 different locations across North America that prove human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some of them were able to get a boat to America.
"It's obvious that humans were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovian culture," said Ruth Grhun, anthropologist at the University of Alberta, Canada.
The interest in tickets has so far been filled with an optimistic scenario, the seller claims.
Prices are also gradually decreasing
Sales of airline tickets in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still about half, but demand increases by up to 20 percent each week.
After-crisis developments, according to vendors, meet the most optimistic scenarios.
The price of airline tickets is also gradually declining.
Among the most sought-after destinations, according to vendors, are mainly southern European countries.
According to kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are the leaders.
At Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz the most flights to Croatian Split are sold.
Of the other countries, the most sought-after is Britain, which was, however, one of the most difficult destinations ever.
The average price of tickets is also declining.
At the portal Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz, around 6250 kronor moved in the middle of the month, with an annual reduction of 3000 kronor.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices in some European countries, such as Spain or Italy, have fallen by about a fifth in the past few weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers who are now buying tickets with much less pre-orders than before, because they are afraid of further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information on Kiwi.com, the time of purchase of a flight has been reduced by about ten days before the departure.
“This confirms the future trend when people will book tickets with much less advances, require more flexibility, take less risks,” said Michal <0xC5><0xA0>indelá<0xC5><0x99>, vice president of Kiwi.com products.
The current average booking time is 21 days before departure.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of renovated airlines from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
There are currently regular flights to more than 60 destinations at Prague Airport.
The summer season is about half of the destinations.
Big finals tonight!
Follow the arrowhead battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC led to the big final.
It introduces experienced Scottish archer Gary Anderson, age forty-nine, and the surprise of the tournament, Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh, age twenty-six.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then hit his neighbor on the table.
However, even James Wade managed and in the quarter-finals he managed to get along well with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
"Flying Scots" had little in the semi-finals when he faced Michael Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped from the graveyard, dominated in the extension and after the result of 18:16, he took the place in the final of the tournament, which he had already mastered in 2018, when he defeated Mensura Suljovi<0xC4><0x8D>e 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of the World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament, and perhaps knowing that he has nothing to lose helped him to play on a fantastic wave.
The twenty-six-year-old archer first surprisingly knocked out Nathan Aspinall's world six, overwhelmingly overwhelmingly overwhelmingly defeating Joe Cullen and defeating Adrian Lewis in the quarter-finals after a sharp start.
The big test was the semi-final.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the start, but quietly playing the Belgian then won an excellent series jump, which he then held until the end more or less without problems.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scores, with which he encountered occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, it has infected 15,212 people.
Almost 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, there are 5,254 sick people.
This is based on data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded two hundred consecutive times.
There were 281 cases on Friday.
There were 235 positive tests on Thursday, 246 on the previous day, and 206 on Tuesday.
In the first working day of this week, 169 people were infected.
In the Czech Republic, 9,590 people have recovered from COVID-19, 63 percent of all infected so far.
In most cases, the disease had a mild course.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people in the hospital with the coronavirus, 19 of whom are considered serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days, accounting for 100,000 people, is still reported by Karvinsko, almost 59.
It is followed by Jihlava district with 56 and Frydecko-Mistecko district with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of people infected in the Czech Republic, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in place since Saturday.
People have to wear scarves at indoor mass events of over 100 people, cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
As of Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited from the current thousand people to half.
Worldwide, the number of people who have been infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded the limit of 16 million.
According to Johns Hopkins University, which is monitoring the pandemic globally.
The death toll from COVID-19 is close to 645,000, according to the source.
The latest million infected were added to the statistics in just three days; the limit of 15 million fell on July 22.
The largest share of the fastest growing number of cases in recent days has been the United States, which has already registered over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where authorities say nearly 1.4 million people have been infected.
Infected are now rising at a record pace.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that more than 284,000 new cases have been reported worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily balance since the pandemic began.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the top in orphaned states such as the US, Brazil or India, but the number of new cases has grown in nearly 40 countries around the world over the past week, according to Reuters.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The disease has already occurred in almost all countries of the world, the first case was officially announced today by the DPRK.
The air in households is up to five times worse than outside.
Health damages air fresheners and deodorants
Health endangers not only poor air quality in outdoors, but also at home.
Israel’s human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted the Jerusalem Post as saying.
According to Abraham, who earned the creation of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on pests in households right now, as many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the U.S. Environmental Agency (EPA) research, which says the air quality of the home is up to five times worse than that of the outdoors.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality in their homes.
“Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced many and still forced them to work from home, people have to spend more hours in homes than before, so it’s time to focus on air quality in homes,” she said.
In Israel, according to her, the quality of "domestic air" is almost no concern.
Things with which a person usually comes into contact can be dangerous - coatings, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
“The poisonous gas is also emitted by clothes that we regularly wear to the cleaner,” said Abraham.
According to her, children, elderly household members and people with respiratory problems are the most at risk.
Even otherwise, healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, sores, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting, or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances can damage the internal organs and the central nervous system.
Not all pests, however, come from objects inside the household, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.
Quiz on Václav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Chart 77
Fuenlabrada lost a chance to progress to the top Spanish football league due to a coronavirus infection in the team.
The competition was originally cancelled by the final round of the second league duel, in which the team was able to secure a play off.
Fuenlabrada reported another 12 infected people on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive COVID-19 tests in the club to 28.
Due to illness in the team, a Monday duel against La Coruña was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada had enough points to get into the playoffs.
The competition’s leadership said today that the duel against La Coruña has definitely appealed with respect to the higher power because it has never been played again.
Fuenlabrada made the decision.
La Coruña, on the other hand, is against the defeat of the match.
Eventually, due to the results of their rivals, the victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save, but he considers it unfair that the last round did not take place in accordance with customary terms.
The leadership of a former Spanish elite club is threatened with a fall in the third league by a court.
The first two teams of the Huesca and Cádiz have confidence in the progress between the elite.
On the remaining third stage place will be played off the clashes of Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche.
Karel Gott did not like Václav Havel?!
Dominic's Daughter Revealed It
"Daddy didn't have him for many years," Gotta Dominik's eldest daughter told Aha! that the Master couldn't make a name for Havel, and whenever a word came to him, Karla said it was always annoyed.
It’s hard to say what they did, but according to Dominica, the dispute started in the mid-1990s.
“In a post-revolutionary article, Dad said that it was easier than he was.
That Havel could have written in the dark at the time, but if he somehow rebelled, his career would have ended,” Gottova said.
In the end, however, he adds, the Czech giants have only found their way to each other.
"I know that Havel could not even hear the word in his sixties.
But then the president congratulated him with a birthday letter, and all of a sudden Dad’s relationship with him began to change,” Dominika recalls.
By the way, ten years later, even God invited the former president to celebrate his seventies at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
“And there began a new era of their relationship, because then Mr. Havel’s father regularly invited him home to Bertramka,” said the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavika also said she hated that Václav Havel had never received a state award.
After all, it was only in 2009, even though it was already in the hands of his successor in the role of Václav Klaus (79).
Further honours are expected in the memoriam, the current President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman (75) is to grant him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memorial.
In the Czech Republic on Tuesday, meteorologists warn of fires
The warning of meteorologists against high temperatures applies for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of the Czech Republic, with the exception of the Karlovy Vary region and also for southern and central Moravia.
“Exceptionally, temperatures can exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in the middle Czech Republic,” they say.
People are advised to adhere to a hot drinking regimen and reduce body weight in the afternoon and afternoon.
Due to the warm weather with minimal precipitation, there will be a risk of thunderstorms on Tuesday morning.
The windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
The warning of meteorologists against the risk of fires concerns the central Czech Republic, including Prague, Liberec, <0xC3><0x9A>stek, Karlovac and Plze<0xC5><0x88> region.
Fire warnings will be valid until appeal.
"We do not expect any more significant falls to mitigate the danger in the northwest and west of the Czech Republic at least by the end of the week," <0xC4><0x8C>HMU said.
The Prague magistrate responded to the warning of meteorologists by banning the distribution of fires in hazardous places, which is expected to apply since Tuesday.
