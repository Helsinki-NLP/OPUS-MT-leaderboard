Welsh members of the assembly are concerned about “similarity to Mapetov”
Some Members of the Assembly (AM) are overreached by a proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This is because the name of the assembly is planned to be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all political parties are concerned that they may thus become the subject of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his party was concerned that the abbreviation was "removed with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means shashaw, and pwp means shawl.
A member of the assembly from the political party "Plaid" stated that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative names.
A Welsh Conservative Party member said his group was "open" to change names, but noted that the MWP was pronounced similar to Muppet (Mapetovci).
In this context, the Welsh pronunciation of the letter "w" is similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on the draft law on name change, made the following statement: "The final decision on the title descriptions of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on publicly accepted proposals for the appointment of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission has set itself for the Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP option, but the MWP option has received the broadest support in public consultations.
Members of the assembly propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could give headaches to the president, Elina Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Laws will also include other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualification of members of the assembly and the plan of the board system.
The members of the assembly will eventually vote for their own title during the debate on the said law.
Macedonians Go to Referendum on Change of State Name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether they will accept the new name of the country "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was organized in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province under the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighboring northern state represents its own territory and has persistently opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would not acknowledge the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing names is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bell has been silenced, and churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
“The old people I’ve talked to say there were cafes and churches in every corner,” Adams said.
“There is no one else today.”
The disappearance of the cafe is understandable.
“People are friends in a different way today,” he says.
“Cafés no longer play the role of day-to-day stays from the neighborhood where people regularly go.”
As for the churches, it is feared that the money from the sale of the property will not take as long as managers expect “and will sooner or later be back in the beginning.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of those kinds of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy homes in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and that will speed up the closure of these churches because it is unlikely that most of those people who emigrated to these residential buildings will become their members.”
Both churches built communities made up of whites before Harlem became the Black Metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original community of white Methodists relocated in the 1930s.
The Black community that was serving God in the vicinity took ownership of the building.
St. Martin took over the black community under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of traders on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who were opposed to hiring or promoting black people.
The fire in 1939 caused major damage to the building, but since Johnson's father's parishioners decided to renovate it, they ordered organs.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organs "the organs of the poor."
The expert who played organs in July called them differently: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also highlighted that these were the first organs in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who had switched to larger organs at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriveder stated that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin is a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were led by the world leaders of the church, and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish administration – the governing body of the parish, composed of world leaders – wrote to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would endeavour to transfer costs” to the parish administration, although the parish administration was not involved in the process of hiring.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old While Hunting Carnations in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while drowning in California's search for sharks on the opening day of the shark season, officials said.
The attack occurred sometime before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dive with friends about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy’s calls to help, and then along with the group he drove to him to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that he first thought it was just excitement about catching a shrimp, but then “he realized he was screaming ‘She bit me!
She bit me."
Members of the assembly of all political parties are concerned that they may thus become the subject of ridicule.
“I called out to everyone out of the water: ‘The shark is in the water!’”
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
It is not known what type of shark he was attacked.
Rescue supervisor Larry Jills said in a statement to the media that a few weeks before that, the shark had already been spotted in the area, but that it was found not to belong to a dangerous species.
Jills added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the body.
Officials closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Karlsbad to the Swami's area in Encinitas.
Jills pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's retail chain plans to enter the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's is becoming a competition with Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams stores with cosmetic departments in the style of merchandise houses where professional assistants work.
As part of the significant penetration of the market of cosmetics in the UK, which turns 2.8 billion pounds, this figure increases as sales in the fashion and home appliances markets drop, the larger sections of the cosmetic products will be tested more than a year if the sewing in 11 sewing in the sewing industry.
Investing in cosmetic products is due to the fact that supermarkets invent ways to take advantage of the space on shelves after complaints for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
The Sainsbury's retail chain has announced it will double its cosmetic offering to as many as 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing product ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with areas for specific brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also re-launches the Boutique makeup range to make most of the products suitable for vegans – which demand is on the rise when it comes to younger customers.
In addition, the perfume shop Fragrance Shop will test out points of sale at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, southern London, last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Purchasing online and switching to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local stores means that supermarkets have to make an extra effort to attract people to visit them.
Mike Cup, executive director of the Sainsbury's retail chain, said that the outlet departments will increasingly resemble self-service as the supermarket chain tries to reward the hit with sales facilities with large discounts Aldi and Lidl products with more services.
Sainsbury's retail chain has opened Argos outlet departments in hundreds of stores and numerous Habitats departments since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which says it has increased the sales of food products and the profitability of procurement.
The previous attempt by this supermarket to modernize the cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments ended infamously.
The Sainsbury's retail chain tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended after a win-win relationship in sharing revenue from pharmaceutical stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes into force after Sainsbury's sold a pharmaceutical company with 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It is said that Lloyds will play a role in this plan by presenting an expanded assortment of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hiks, Sales Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the appearance and experience of our cosmetic departments to provide our customers with a better environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at the service of providing advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all the needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an indispensable destination for cosmetic products that sets new standards for the way we shop."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million retirement
Peter Jones, star of the series "Dragons Den," "enraged" after TV host Holly Willoby resigned from the 11 million-dollar business with his personal brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willobi has no time for their brand of home and accessories Truly.
The couple's company collaborated with the Goop brand of actress Gwinnett Paltrow.
The 37-year-old actress announced her departure on Instagram this morning.
Holly Willoby angered Peter Jones, the star of the "Dragons" Den series, by pulling out of a last-minute lucrative business with their brand to focus on their own new entry contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the source, Jones was "enraged" when a TV screen favorite during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to new bids worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of time, he was given up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The company co-operated with the Goop brand actress Gwinnett Paltrow and was expected to double the estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million worth of Willobie's fortune.
When Willoby, 37, posted on Instagram to leave True, Jones left the UK at one of his weekends.
In the words of the source: “Holly put the brand Truely on top of its own priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term plan from which she would earn in the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has stunned all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch date.
The warehouse in Marlow is packed with a slave ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving the driver of the program "This Morning", one of the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothes and home appliances as possible.
This could also mark the end of a long friendship.
Willoby, who is the mother of three children and her husband Dan Baldwin, has been intimate with Jones and his wife Taro Cape for ten years.
Willoby founded True with Cape in 2016, and in March joined Jones, 52, as the company’s director.
The couple spend the holidays together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production house.
Willoby will become the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ent McPartlin as the host of the show "I'm A Celebrity" TV channel ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
After the hard words, “sympathies appeared.”
He has been criticized in the media for comments that some have “not been worthy of the president” and for his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so retreating?
Trump said imitating the voice of the TV commentator.
“I’m not pulling back from anything.”
He pointed out that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump praised their initial June meeting in Singapore as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on denuclearization have ended.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top North Korean diplomat, Ree-jong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly held on Saturday that there was no “appropriate reaction” by the U.S. to the initial North Korean talks.
Instead, he stressed, the United States does not repeal sanctions that are under continuous pressure.
Trump has expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We are making great progress with North Korea," he said.
“We were a step away from the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would suffer.
We have a great relationship now.”
He pointed out that his efforts to improve relations with Kim gave positive results – missile tests were over, taoists were released, and the remaining U.S. troops returned home.
This unusual approach has been defended by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be a great president, but instead of 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would stand there," Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate the island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the island's population has been displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not seek international help, so we face certain difficulties," Mrs Sumbung said.
While “Save the Children” teams up a team that will travel to Palu, it is still unknown whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies will be allowed to participate in providing assistance.
Given the constant earthquakes that shake Indonesia, it is regrettable how unprepared this country is for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they can rarely be found on other shores.
The loss of life was also likely contributed to the apparent non-scratching of the cheese for the tsunami warning in Palu, although the warning was in force.
Travelling between numerous Indonesian islands and otherwise is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was stationed on Lombok Island to point out assistance to the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the site of a new accident.
President Yoko Vidodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia’s long-term infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of financial resources hit Mr. Yokoa's administration, and he will be re-elected next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces the pressures that create long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim population have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets, using swords, bows and arrows and other harsh weapons.

The statue of Cromwell in front of the parliament building becomes the subject of the latest debate over the monuments over the controversy over the "falsification of history"
Its removal would be poetic justice for its destruction in the Taliban-style of many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Kryk's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to falsify history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “The figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace was an unmistakable target in the current debate on the removal of the statues.
Cromwell neither issued an order nor conducted an iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the work of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent view of Cromwell by Sir William Hamoa Turnicoft bears witness to 19th-century opinion and is part of the historiography of a figure that, to many, still deserves to be magnified.
Mr. Goldsmith made the following statement for The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, consider that Cromwell defended Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
The credibility of this description has been the subject of constant debate throughout history.
What is certain is that this mid-17th century conflict shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is as an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His successes as the Lord Protector also deserve to be magnified and protected from forgetfulness."
Pig Killer Injures Chinese Peasant
According to local media reports, a villager attacked and killed a pig at a drink in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut-out artery and covered with blood near a pig at a drink in the city of Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday.
The owner of the pig farm is preparing to inject pig injections in Xinjiang, China.
On Wednesday, he reportedly came with a relative from neighboring Yunan province to sell 15 pigs at a bar.
The next morning, a relative caught him dead and noticed that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said the pig was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
A Forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound pig had fatally injured a peasant, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and saturated," said a relative mentioned under the name "Wu", according to Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage shows that Juan went to the bar on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either John or his relative.
The drink manager told Evening News that the pig was locked in order not to attack anyone else, as police collected evidence on the spot.
Juan's family and the drinkers' officials are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely occurs, there have already been recorded cases of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a wife and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, causing a critical injury to a man.
Ten years earlier, the 295-pound pig kept a Welsh farmer lying next to a tractor until his wife had fed the animal.
After the Oregon peasants ate the pigs in 2012, a peasant from Manitoba province told CBC News that the pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can be a “scatter.”
“They’re just playing.
They like to snack, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
Hurricane Ross Remains Will Bring Widespread Spills to Southwestern US
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves across the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa, with winds of 137 km/h, was a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday morning at 5 a.m., located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Ross is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the low-pressure field begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and moves eastwards towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa on Monday approaches the Peninsula of Lower California as a tropical storm, it begins to push a high tropical slope, a rainstorm.
On Monday, some parts of Mexico will bring up to 25 cm of rain.
Then, in the coming days, tropical humidity due to contact with a low-pressure field that is approaching will lead to widespread splashes in the southwest.
The amount of rain from 2.5 to 10 cm in local areas will cause dangerous flooding, the distribution of water fractures and the possibility of the emergence of a slippery slope in the desert.
High tropical humidity will locally cause precipitation of about 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to rain from 5 to 10 cm in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Flooding floods are possible with a sharp deterioration of conditions due to the uninhibited nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely unthinking to walk into the desert as the danger of tropical rains threatens.
Due to abundant rainfall, cannons can be converted into raised rivers, and storms with bushes will lead to stormy winds and dust in the air.
The approaching low-pressure field will bring locally strong rainfall in some parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible that amounts of precipitation of over 1.5 cm, which can cause less multiplication of water fractures and slippery slopes.
It will be the first rainfall in the region for their rainy season.
Local tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday night and on Monday morning, and on Monday night and on Tuesday rains will occupy a wider area.
The blasts will extend to the area of the southwestern part of Colorado, the southeastern part of Utah, the northeastern part of Arizona and the northwestern part of New Mexico on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, large temperature fluctuations across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools, while in tropical areas it will remain fairly warm.
This sometimes causes huge differences in temperature at short distances.
A great example are the dramatic temperature differences in the central part of the United States on a Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moyne in Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees.
The long-lasting summer heat will grow and spread again in the next few days.
In most central and eastern parts of the United States, the warming of October is expected with a temperature of 27 degrees Celsius in much of the country, from the southern plains to the northeast.
The temperature in New York could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high chances of over-average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Bret Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels on Thursday the thrilling testimonies of Supreme Court judge Bret Kavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly occurring in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with television houses interrupting Friday's regular schedule due to a reversal at the last minute: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI should carry out a week-long and a week-long bill.
Ford said before the Senate Justice Committee that she was 100 percent sure that drunken Kavanaugh had beaten her and tried to tear her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a touching testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it didn’t happen.
That was probably watched by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, according to the Nielsen agency.
She calculated the average viewing of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that displayed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
At the same time, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of spectators in offices.
For comparison, that number of spectators can pair to the audience that follows a play-off game or an Oscar award.
The Fox News Channel, with the hosts of the "Opinion" show that strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, recorded the highest viewing of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen agency.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
This process aroused great interest even after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of the drama that took place on Friday.
After a statement from the moderate Republican's office said he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS television cameras filmed on Friday morning protesters screaming at him while trying to connect him with an elevator to a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood for a few minutes of a lowered look while being insulted, which CNN broadcast live.
“I’m standing in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
They said to him, “You have power, and so many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he said he had more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and television houses were broadcast live hours later when the Justice Committee was due to vote to forward Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate in full.
However, Flake said he agrees to this only on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the nominee over the next week, which was insistently demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After talks with Kuns and several other senators after him, Fleck made the decision.
Flake's choice had a weightlifter it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “playing politics” in Brexit case
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is attending a Conservative Party conference on September 29, 2018 in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Checkers plan for Brexit, calling the proposal for a single customs zone of Britain and the EU "completely pointless".
Wade Sims Murder: Police Arrested Suspect Dayton Simpson for Death of University of Louisiana Player
Police have arrested the suspect for the murder of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and housed behind bars on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials posted a video of a clash between Sims and Simpsons, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses from the spot and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB channel attached to the CBS network.
After examining Simpson, police said he had confessed to Wade's death by a gunshot.
He was given a <0x24>350,000 bail, the lawyer said.
The parish office of pathologists in East Baton Rouge on Friday published a preliminary report in which the cause of death is reported as a shot wound from a bullet through the head to the neck.
The merit of assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest of the department is attributed to the Louisiana State Police Operational Unit for the arrest of fugitives, the State Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the local hospitals.
The director of the Department of Athletics at the University of Louisiana, Joe Aleva, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for "the commitment and aspiration to justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
In the past, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 leaps per game.
University of Louisiana basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“It’s something that keeps us worried,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes into Mexico City
The ash that ejects the Popocatepetl volcano came to the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from volcanoes due to increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
This center has noted more mild seismological activities.
Images on social networks could see thin layers of ash on the windscreens of cars in municipalities in Mexico City, such as Hoccimilko.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital after a 7.1-degree earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists on the eve of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence supporters clashed with the intervention police, as thousands joined counter-demonstration on the first anniversary of the Catalan vote on the split that divided the population.
A group of masked separatists, surrounded by the intervention police, fired them with eggs and threw paint into the dust, so they created dark clouds of dust on the streets that usually sunk from tourists.
Later in the day, there was also a fight that the police had surrounded the detainees.
Groups advocating for independence have been chanting "No Forgets, No Forgiveness" for hours, facing Protestant unionists who shouted: "Live Spain."
Fourteen people received help due to minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media reports.
Tension is not eating in a region designated for independence even a year after the October 1 referendum, which the separatist Catalans celebrated, although Madrid declared it illegal.
Voters largely voted for independence, although the response was small as the mass of people who were against the split boycotted the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
Groups advocating for independence camped on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police forces.
The demonstrations were held, but the route had to change.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who came with his wife to protest the separatist, said he had lost hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we experienced one of the brightest moments.
"My parents were crying out of luck for being able to vote, but now we are in an impasse," he said.
Despite achieving a key but narrow victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan independence-sponsored parties have had a hard time continuing in the same spirit this year, even though many of their most well-known leaders have been in the process of self-defense or self-defense.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest in support of police on the phone, said the clash was backed by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is all tense,” he said.
Oriol Honkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for trial since late last year, has announced that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"Submitting a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the destruction of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men Arrested After Punching a Car Into House
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after being hit by a car several times in a house in London.
The incident took place on Thursday at Ballynagard Crescent Street around 7:30 p.m. in British Summer Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the entrance and the building were damaged.
It is also possible that at some point a self-propelled gun was fired at the house.
Menge hit brings Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga secured first goal win for Livingston
Livingston surprised Rangers after moving into the top league, forcing Steven Gerard to admit his second defeat in 18 games as the club's manager from Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Manga with his goal made changes as the Gary Holt team equated with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team this season remains unsuccessful at the Premier League guests, and next week he meets with leaders on the Hartsim table, for which he has eight points left.
Earlier this year, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended a series of six-match unbaptized divisional defeats, with head coach Holt not yet experienced a defeat after replacing Ken Miller last month.
Livingston Missed Opportunities Against Uninspired Guests
Holt's team had to lead long before the hit he achieved, as the offensive game made Rangers trouble at all levels.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he wore the ball in front of the goal, to shoot Alan Litgou next to the net after he stepped in to receive a blow to Craig Halkett's head in front of the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers players play in front of them, knowing that they could give the guest team difficulties with the action played.
That’s how they scored a key goal.
The Rangers made a break, and Livingston opened the game after performing a free kick by combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson with Meng who tracked the ball to the goal from the mid-sheathers.
In the previous part of the game, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but couldn't break the host's defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems,
The same style continued in the second half, although Kelly had to defend one stroke of Alfred Morelos.
Alan McGregor, Rangers' goalkeeper, rejected Scott Pittman's attack and shot Litgow next to the goal in the second played action of Livingston.
Livingston defended several central shots, and two penalties were refused – after Halkett’s objection to replacing Glenn Middleton and one to play by hand.
“The Fantastic Game” Livingston – Analysis
Alasder Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
All the players, without exception, were extraordinary and once again exceeding expectations on this ascent path.
Since returning to the first rows, the style of the game and the people have hardly changed, but it is necessary to give great credit to Holt for the way he has instilled vitality in the team since his arrival.
There were so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was unsurpassed in leading top-class organized defense, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Warral in preparation all the time.
However, Rangers was not inspiring.
No matter how good he once was under Gerald, he fell much below that level.
They couldn’t score – they only broke the host’s defense once – and that’s their own alarm bell for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan met at a mixed reception in Cologne
The meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29) during breakfast in Berlin was accompanied by mixed reactions.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues that include human rights, media freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
In this city, most of the Turkish population lives outside of Turkey.
Police blocked a gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, citing security reasons, but many supporters were nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of whom were Kurds – were also heard condemning Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Controversial protests reflect the shared opinion of a visitor that some Turks in Germany are turning into a hero, while others accuse him of being an autocrat.
Road Accident in Deppford: Bicycle rider killed in collision with car
In a car crash in London, a cyclist was killed.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 UTC.
The driver of the car stopped and the hospitals pointed to him for help, but the man died on the spot.
A few months before the collision, another cyclist was killed in Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the collision that took place on Saturday, which the driver hit and ran away.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working on identifying the man and informing his closest relatives.
Roads are closed and bus routes are changed, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six policemen injured in riots
Six inmates were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the prison said.
The still ongoing riot came at Her Majesty’s Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 09:30 British Summer Time.
A team of Tornado specialists has been brought to overcome the unrest that has been reduced to one wing and which involves eight prisoners.
Police officers were given assistance on the spot due to minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison officials have been brought in because of the current incident in Her Majesty Long Lartin's prison.
Six members of the staff were assisted in the injury.
“We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and our position is clear that the responsible persons will be reported to the police, which is why they could stay behind bars for longer.”
Her Majesty Long Lartin has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the state.
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator was undergoing hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, police intervention was called to prison for serious riots in which staff were attacked by billiard balls.
The cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened by Hurricane Rosa with flooding (which can well come to areas affected by drought)
Tropical depression rarely affects Arizona, but it is likely to arrive early next week as Hurricane Rosa moves across the desert in the southwest, carrying the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, and Flagstaff.
Rosa is expected to come directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will announce rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) hit the region 64 km away from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall from 5 to 10 cm, with volumes up to 15 cm in isolated places, such as the Mongolian Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the desert in the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to be 2.5-5 cm, with possible total amounts in isolated places and up to 10 cm.
For areas where there is no dreadful flooding that the Rosa will bring can be a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious cause of concern, rain will be welcome in some parts because in the southwest the government is currently drought.
According to the U.S. drought surveillance agency, slightly over 40 percent of Arizona was affected at the very least by extreme drought, a second-order category,” reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa's journeys lead first to the slopes of the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning still had hurricane strength with maximum winds of 135 kilometres per hour, is currently 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 20 kilometres per hour.
The storm found colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it lost power.
It is therefore expected that the slope in Mexico will arrive when the storm reaches the strength of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall is possible, which brings a significant risk of flooding.
“A total amount of 8 to 15 cm of rainfall is expected from Lower California to the northwestern part of Sonora State, with possible up to 10 cm,” reports weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, to reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then move further through Arizona and on Tuesday night arrive at the Isle of Wight.
"The main danger expected from Rose or its remains is very abundant rainfall in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the US desert in the southwestern part of the country," the National Hurricane Monitoring Centre said.
It is expected that this rain will lead to life-threatening floods and watersheds in the deserts and hilly terrain.
Midsummer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempting to Kill
After a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerst, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The injured teen was found on Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. in British Summer Time.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
During the night, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the area of the city of Radstock, the Avon and Somerset police service said.
Police have asked anyone who might have footage of the incident on their mobile phones to contact her.
Trump Says Kavanaugh “Passed Anger and Anger” by Democratic Party
“The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a speech in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had “suffered the wrath and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
In an energetic and emotional testimony on Thursday before Congress, Kavanaugh denied the claims of Christine Blaise Ford that she had sexually abused her decades ago when she was a teenager.
During this hearing, Ford also testified about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the American people "saw all the genius, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class biography in public service," he said in front of a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president briefly commented on Kavanaugh's nomination during a speech on the importance of Republicans' response to the midterm elections.
“Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I’m not personally a candidate, I’m actually a candidate,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates all over the world.”
Trump concluded that the Democrats are on a mission of “providing resistance and interference.”
The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected by Friday, according to a senior GOP assistant to CNN.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia left hundreds dead, and this number continues to grow
At least 384 people were killed, with many carrying giant waves crashing into the beaches when the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a major earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu at a beach festival on Friday when six-meter-high waves struck the coast at dawn, bringing many to death and destroying everything that was on their way.
The tsunami caused an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach, rather than immediately fleeing and therefore becoming victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian agency, said in a statement.
“The tsunami did not come alone, but pulled cars, trees, houses and hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palu.
The air photos published by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops were destroyed, the bridges were distorted and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
Storms hit the coastal city again on Saturday.
In the area where 2.4 million people live, there are earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy of the devastating earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb fired on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical characteristics of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, have contributed to the development of a greater magnitude of the tsunami," he said.
Nugroho said it had been damaged "in large quantities" and said it had collapsed on thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the building’s wreckage, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho noted that possible increases in losses and damage along the coast 300 km north of the city of Palu, an area called Dongal, which is closest to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications "were completely interrupted and there was no information" from Dongale, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers had taken to the threatened area.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” the statement said.
The agency received criticism from various sides on Saturday that it had not issued a warning that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top floor of the building cries out of the claws, warning people on the street about the tsunami approaching.
Within a few minutes, the water wall hit the shore, referring to buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the credibility of the footage.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, there was a loss of electricity that caused a breakdown of communications around Palu, making it difficult for the competent authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
Competent authorities said the military had begun sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but that the evacuated people were still in need of food and other basic troubles.
The city airport is reopened only for assistance that arrives and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The balance of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeded 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
The staff of the humanitarian organization World Vision has safely arrived from Dongal to the city of Palu, where employees are hiding in shelters from waterproof canvas set in the yard of the office and on their way to the city were welcomed by the scenes of destruction and desertification.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is extremely bad.
Even when aid groups began taking the first steps to mitigate the disaster, there were complaints that foreign humanitarian workers with deep expertise were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of overseas resources, supplies and people is only possible if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still characterised as a provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When state institutions declare a national disaster, we can provide international assistance, but so far there is no such status.”
When the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that struck it on Friday, friends and family of the missing still craved the hope that their dearest would by some miracle escape the sad fate of the victims of natural disasters.
The boy was removed from the sewers on Saturday.
Rescuers on Sunday released a woman under the rubble that had been trapped next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The rest of the prisoners at the Roa Roa hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse reached the paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu who attended the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one gray mark, instead of two blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole <0x24>26,750 during ATM charging at Newport on the Levee
The robbers stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled an ATM at the Newport on the Levee facility on Friday morning, according to the Newport Police Department.
The car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to put in more money, Detective Denis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, the other man “runned behind the back of an employee at Brink’s” and stole a bag of money he was supposed to put in a ATM.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities is invited to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Reper changed name to “Ye”
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to “Ye”.
Posting this change on Saturday on his Twitter account, he wrote: “It will be known someday as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, so he used it to name his eighth album, which was released in June.
This change comes before his appearance on the show "Saturday Night Live", in which he is expected to announce a new album "Yandhi".
The show was called in instead of singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled for “emotional reasons,” the show’s author said.
In addition to representing the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that this word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible and means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with a radio director named Big Boy.
“So, I am you, I am all of us, that is us.
From the name Kanye, which means ‘one’, I switched to only ‘Ye’ (i) – which is the personification of all the good, bad, and unclear in us.
This album is, in essence, a reflection of who we are.”
He is just one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, known by the nicknames Paf Dedi, Pi Didi or Didi, this year stressed that he would like to be labeled with "Love" and "Brother Love".
A former West's associate, JJ-Z, used a nickname with or without a cartoon and capital letters.
Mexico’s president, AMLO, says he will not use the military against civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, in his 50th anniversary of bloody revenge against students in this country, vowed to never apply military force to civilians.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at a square in Tlatelolco that he would "never use the army to carry out repression against the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops shot at peaceful protesters gathered in the square and killed as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were founded in Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial assistance to those studying each month and by opening more free state universities.
He said unemployment and the inability to get education are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double the amount of artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the development of artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount it spends on research in this area, says Kai-Fu Li, an investor and AI expert who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments followed after various sides of the U.S. government announced the development of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. generally does not have an official strategy for it.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to be No. 1 in AI innovations by 2030.
“In the beginning, it would be good to double the budget for AI research, as all other countries are so late for the US, and we are striving for new progress in this domain,” Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next big achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the United States, Li told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Super-Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, works as executive director of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest companies in the world.
He worked at Carnegie Melon University in the 1980s on an Artificial Intelligence system that won the highest-ranked American Otel player, and later served as director of Microsoft Research and chairman of the Google branch in China.
He acknowledged previous competitions in the U.S. government's technology, such as the "Robot Challenge" of the U.S. Department of Defense Agency responsible for the development of new technologies (DARPA), and asked when the next would take place, to help identify the next move.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win state scholarships, Lee said.
"Academic leaders are not going to China, but to big corporations," he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been employing prominent minds from the university in recent years to work on the development of artificial intelligence.
Lee points out that changes in immigration policy could help the United States strengthen its aspirations in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a plan to develop artificial intelligence of the next generation.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences finances people in academic institutions similar to the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations allocating money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence that will include partners from this sector and from the academy, while the White House announced the formation of a select committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA has announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation.
On the other hand, the National Foundation for Science (NSF) is currently investing more than 100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
The citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether they would change their name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, ending a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their candidates for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighboring northern state represents its own territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would jeopardize the ethnic identity of the Macedonian, mostly Slavic population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the exit would reach a minimum of 50 percent, as much as it takes for the referendum to be valid.
A referendum question on the voting list reads: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are of the opinion that it is a price worth paying in exchange for membership in alliances such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that have fallen apart from Yugoslavia.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the cover of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Oliver Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
While this is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs said they would comply with the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission has announced that no irregularities have been reported before 13:00.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 percent of registered voters came to the polls.
“I went to vote for my children, because we have a place in Europe,” said Djose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, together with his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>k, voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that should open the way for this country to join NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepares a small building and places chairs in front of tents set by opponents of the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the upside-down heads, not through the service entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev claims that membership in NATO would bring over necessary investment to Macedonia, in which the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be ‘for’ because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for membership in the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He added that the result for “for” would be “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will vote for the referendum, which is below the required voter turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television Telma, concluded that 57 percent of the voters will go to the referendum.
Seventy percent of the respondents said they would vote “Yes.”
In order for the referendum to succeed, half of the registered voters plus one are required to vote.
Failure to hold a referendum would mark the first serious blow to pro-Western government policies since taking power in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes all of Brighton's defense and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling were on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England's dominant defense of Brighton, taking a 2-0 win over Manchester City.
It seemed too easy when Aguero scored a shot in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received an addition in the middle of the field from where he started the attack.
He ran between the three defensive players of Brighton, so he cut everything in a row on the open field.
At that time, Aguar was surrounded by four green t-shirts.
He overplayed one defensive player, so he scored a few more on the edge of Brighton's goal.
Then he shoved the ball to the left, finding Sterling.
The English wing player immediately returned the ball to Aguer, who with a right-handed kicked over goalkeeper Brighton Matthew Ryan by shooting to the right-hand side of the net.
“Aguero has certain foot problems,” Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City, told reporters.
"We agreed to play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what it was.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
However, the initial advantage for the Sky Blues in the Premier League meeting was brought by Sterling.
He scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the territory of Brighton in that action.
He directed a wonderful addition to Leroy Sean on the left side.
Sean had several contacts with the ball before hitting Sterling on the other rack.
The Sky Blues attacker put the ball in the net, to immediately slip out of the boundary of the field.
Manchester City will meet Hofenheim at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in a Champions League group game at the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game against Rocky without competing importance for Neshnals
Since Neshnals was eliminated from the play-off competition, there were not many reasons to insist on another match.
However, competitively-adjusted Sherzer hopes to occupy a position on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have one game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers, are still in the play-off game.
The Rockies secured themselves a wild-card spot on Friday night with a 5-2 victory over Neshnals, but are still trying to win the first title in the division.
"While we can't get anything, at least we can get out on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other team is likely to be at the highest level against any point I would play this year.
Why wouldn’t I participate in such a competition?”
Neshnals has not yet announced a startup for a week, but are allegedly considering letting Sherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th time to open the game, held a training session on Thursday and will throw on a Sunday when he rests.
Washington's right-hander this season leads 18-7 with an average of deserved wounds of 2.53 and 300 strike cars in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia.
The president briefly commented on the situation in which his nominee for Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh, is, during a speech on the importance of Republicans' response to the midterm elections.
“Everything we have achieved in November will be put at stake.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are some of the biggest — although I’m not personally running, I’m actually running and that’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued: “Look at this terrible radical group of Democrats, look at what’s happening now.
They are determined to regain power by not choosing the means, see hell, dirty games.
They don’t care who they’re going to hurt, who they have to overwhelm to get power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we won’t give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission of “providing resistance and interference.”
“You could have seen it in the past four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “ angry, disgusting, disgusting, and insincere.”
He mentioned Democratic senator and member of the Justice Committee Dayan Feinstein by name, which caused a loud outrage to the public.
“Do you remember her response?
Did you leave the document in public?
Uh, what.
No, no, I’m waiting for him – it was a very bad body speech – the worst body speech I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer accepts different positions.
There is no tolerance for those who express their opinions.
When the activists of Momentum in my local foreign country voted for my censorship, it hardly surprised me.
I am only the last in a series of members of parliament from the Labour Party to be said not to be welcome – just because we have expressed our opinions.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan River, passed the same thing because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship initiative followed criticism for disagreement with Jeremiah Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe – the irony is that these are similar topics that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting at the Labour Party in East Nottingham on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to be comprehensive and productive.”
For eight years since I was a Member of Parliament of the Labour Party, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday night have been mostly the same.
Unfortunately, meetings are rarely held in this spirit today, and the promise of a “nobler, more moderate” policy has long been forgotten, if ever there have been such aspirations.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the Labour Party does not tolerate different attitudes and each opinion is assessed according to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I had previously thought to share similar political stances began to expect me to change them from the roots and occupy positions with which I would never otherwise agree to work without it.
Every public address I make – no matter what I say – follows a tyranny of abuse on social networks in which it calls for the cancellation of my election, condemns the policy of the center, commands that I have no place in the Labor Party.
I'm not the only one with that experience.
I am aware that I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments are directed to me usually of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a heap of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, without ever washing them up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that various types of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
The real truth is that we no longer accept different attitudes and with every voice of distrust or change in the rules of the election, the party becomes increasingly indicted.
Over the past two years, I have often been counseled, calling me to lower my head, to keep my opinion for myself, and then I would be “adjusted.”
But they're in line with my political goals.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago from the school bench, provoked by the turmoil of the government, Margaret Thatcher, who allowed my school classroom to literally collapse, I tried to fight to provide better public services to those who were most in need.
I've never hidden my political determination, not even in the last election.
No one in Eastern Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political beliefs and the topics on which I do not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this initiative on Friday, I would only order that, in the moments when our country sneaks into Brexit that will threaten our households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the country, Labour.
However, my only message is not intended for the organization Momentum from Nottingham, but for my voters, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that I am not threatening you with any objections by annihilating my election, or political objections by refusing to accept them.
Chris Leslie is the ambassador for East Nottingham.
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Untaxed Air is climbing to the top
Two late essays may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ireland took the deserved victory in this exciting Tennent's Premier League game of the day.
Now they are at the top of the table, as the only untaxed side out of a total of ten.
In the end, the domestic team took over thanks to the superior defense, as well as a greater number of chances utilized and coach Peter Murchi had every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in the games so far and we haven’t yet experienced a defeat, so I have to be satisfied,” he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose team said: “All the praises for Ireland, they’ve made better use of their chances than we have.”
An essay by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frieser Klima, gave Ireland an advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, which the Warriors brought out of the show, allowed Melroya to take advantage of the numerical advantage.
Climate increased Ireland's leadership by a benchmark, before, in the meantime, achieving and converting a solo essay to make Ireland on a break to reach a score of 17-5.
However, Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's essay, which was converted by Bagot, reduced the score to five points.
Then there was a long stop due to the serious injury of Ruarid Not, which they carried on the carriers, and Irr further increased the leadership of Stafford McDowell's essay, which was transformed by Clima.
Then Ira's deputy captain, Blair McFerson, got a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the player's advantage more by failing Bruce Colvin to convert the essay, after a shorter severe pressure.
However, the host's side returned and when Struan Hackinson was given a yellow card because of scoring with Clima without a ball, from the penalty line, McFerson scored a down point behind the Ira's mall in the attack.
Clima transformed the essay, which again made almost immediately the sequel, after Kyle Row picked up the hit of David Armstrong and sent the wing of Gregor Henry for the fifth home essay.
Star of the “Still Game” series is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
"Still Game" star Ford Kiernan is preparing to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been appointed director of the company that holds licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, in which he is the screenwriter and actor along with his longtime comedy partner, Gregor Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the series and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for life after Craiglan.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper indicated that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "successful restaurant sector" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has been deprived of access to the sea, hopes that the court will allow it to exit the Pacific again
Marines patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, the flags of the ocean are bright.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with a slogan: “We have a lot of right to the sea.
We have to bring him back.”
In Bolivia, which has been deprived of access to the sea, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody conflict around resources with Chile in the 19th century, and with it the desire for another Pacific sailing.
These hopes are perhaps the greatest in the last few decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice’s ruling on October 1 after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia's current development of the situation is at hand, with it the spirit of unity and peace governed and, of course, expects an outcome in a positive spirit," said Roberto Kalsadilja, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will judge in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the surrender of a sovereign country.
For Eva Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – expected next year’s controversial re-election fight – the verdict to be passed on Monday also poses a lot of risks.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and that a little change will occur even if it happens.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is pronounced only six months after the final arguments have been heard indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And not only has the case of Bolivia not progressed, but it may have been reversed in the previous four years.
“The question of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales’ war-torn rhetoric killed every inclination towards Chile, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Edward Rodriguez Velce, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the claim that the court had taken an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calsadilla also denied that Morales – who was still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the question of the sea as a political backdrop.
“Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific,” he added.
“This judgment is an opportunity to see the need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it doesn’t have confidence in the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ree Yong Ho, said his people would never abolish a nuclear weapons program if they had no confidence in Washington.
Ree gave a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore in talks with conflicted leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not seem to have resumed deadly diplomatic talks on nuclear weapons more than three months after a meeting with North Korean Kim Jong-un.
Ri says it's just letting dreams that the continuation of sanctions and opposition to the U.S. declaration ending the Korean War will ever throw North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to accept the declaration until Pyongyang makes significant steps in the disarmament process.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, the government is generally skeptical when it comes to Pyongyang’s seriousness with regard to the denial of the nuclear arsenal that his country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris Fashion Shows are presented the latest lines of gloomy head covering accessories that you will soon see in the nearby main street
If you want to enrich the collection of hats with more gloomy models or to completely block the sun, the quest is over.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented on the track a series of huge headband accessories from their spring/summer 2019 collection that blurred everything at Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely impractical hats lit Instagram this summer, and these designers showed their impressive creations on the fashion track.
Among Valentine's pieces, the most prominent was the over-republished beige hat decorated with a wide edge resembling a feather that swallowed the model's heads with its size.
Other gloomy accessories include jewelry-decorated dolphins, magic hats, and even pineapple – but they’re not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also presented a collection of bizarre masks – at the right time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had embroidered lips and resembled more Hannibal Lector than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment in a kit with a breather and a mask, while the other looked like a melted ice cream in a corneal.
And if you follow the trend of attracting attention to gloomy fashion details – you are lucky.
Those who follow trends predict that huge hats could soon be worn on nearby main streets.
The glossy hats follow the appearance of the popular slate hat “La Bomba” with a two-metre-wide edge that has strolled many celebrities – from Rihanna to Emily Rataikovsky.
The cult label on this impractical hat, which flooded the social networks, stood behind another great creation that was shown on the track – muddy beach bags of almost the same size as the model in the bathing suit he wore.
In the Jacquemus collection "La Riviera" for spring/summer 2019 at the Fashion Week in Paris, the most highlighted is a bag made of raffia in the color of burnt orange, rubbed with raffia and with a white leather handle at the top.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect that big hats and beach bags will arrive on the main street next summer – since the designer has made so much boom, it would be hard to ignore so much demand for glossy accessories.”
John Edwards: Knowledge of language is of key importance to global citizens.
Independent schools in Scotland can boast of outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new series of outstanding test results, further reinforced by the individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other assets.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strives to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and more education, a chosen career, and a place in society as a global citizen.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it’s going to get into his head.
If you speak in his native language, he will touch his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s tests, we see that languages are at the top of the league table with the highest passing ratings in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher A score.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher A score from Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French and 63 percent of those who learn Spanish also received an A score.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland value foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now given the same importance as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
In a 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission, 17 percent were attributed to non-linguistics for reasons that employers cited as the main problems in filling vacancies.
This is why language skills are becoming more and more important in order to prepare young people for future careers.
Given the more potential business opportunities that languages require, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned another language, in the future he will have a real advantage because he possesses a skill like this for the rest of his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a person who speaks more languages above competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey involving more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent said they did not speak a foreign language well enough to lead a conversation, while French was the only language that spoke two-digit percent of respondents.
This is why it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
Knowledge of more languages, especially those spoken in developing countries, will provide children with greater chances of finding a significant job.
Each school in Scotland will learn a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are thought to be the most important for the UK to look forward to in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, in independent schools will always be available more languages to choose from, with teaching staff who are professional in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever awaits them in the future.
It cannot be denied that today, in the global business environment, languages are still crucial to the future of the country, so they must have their place in education as well.
Modern languages, in fact, should be considered “skills of international communication.”
Independent schools in Scotland will continue to provide young people with this choice, diversity and exceptional achievements.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
It's nearing the end of the wait for fans who want to see LeBron James launching for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a Sunday’s pre-season game against Denver Nahets in San Diego.
But his exact minutiae still needs to be determined.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James is likely to have a limited minute.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six-match pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need a pre-season game at this stage of my career to prepare myself,” he said.
Time of Trump’s rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of rallying tonight as part of an election campaign in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallyes for next week, with retention in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote was postponed to confirm his candidate for a vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are threatened by losing control of Congress as soon as possible.
At what time will Trump hold a rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you view it online?
The Trump rally in Wiling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trump rally in West Virginia can be watched below online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about this week's hearings for Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavanaugh, who have become tense over allegations of sexual harassment, with a vote expected to confirm admission to the Senate not to be postponed for a week.
However, this series of rallyes is held primarily to help Republicans gain support in the November election meeting.
Therefore, as part of President Trump’s campaign, the five rallyes to be held next week are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the Representative to the National Assembly.”
“The significance of Congress’s control is so great for his program of work that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the beginning of the busy campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
This evening’s rally, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wiling, could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, along with a media broadcast from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump's visit to West Virginia, the state in which he won elections with more than 40 percent points in 2016, will be the second on Saturday in the last month.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia Patrick Morris, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morissey that the president has to come to try to raise him in polls,” said Simon Heather, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Raider Cup 2018: U.S. team shows determination in the fight to stay in the game in a singles match on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, a couples tournament on Saturday afternoon may be just what a Ryder Cup needs.
Although the variability of moments is an invented sport concept, players really believe in it, and especially in competitions of this type.
So, on whose side would you say that now is the moment?
“They had a lead of six points, and now four, so it can be said that the moment is on our side,” said Jordan Spit.
Europe, of course, is ahead of us with four points of advantage and another twelve in the game.
Although Americans, according to Spice, get a little wind in their backs and have a lot on their side, especially the Spice and Justin Thomas form that played together all day and each has three points of four.
Spit was murdered from the first to the last shot and assigned homework to everyone.
The whispers of enthusiasm became louder during his round, to eventually play a key finish and get a fourth match with the same result when he and Thomas were left behind for two after two.
His final hit with a 15-hole sword was greeted with a similar scream, which reflects the belief that the American team did not fall.
"In essence, you just have to give your best and take care of your own sword," Spit said.
That’s all these players can do.
18 holes to leave a seal.
The only players with more points than Spice and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who are undoubtedly the Ryder Cup story.
An unusual and equally charming European pair won all four matches and played without a mistake.
"Mollywood" was the only couple that didn't play the Gods hits on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and in the second half on Friday morning.
The game, which has been shown so far, and the way in which they exchange energy with a noisy audience, has solidified them in the position of main favourites on Sunday and there is no more popular player than Flytwood or Molinary that could bring a potential European victory to the National Golf Championship.
If possible, both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about European celebrations.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly mastered Heart of Garcia, the morning hero in a four-ball game, when he was in a pair with Alex Noren.
The gods and the double gods in the first nine holes buried the Spaniards and the Swedes in a hole from which they never succeeded.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you get out of the hole.
The game with four balls and the tournament pairs are so fascinating to watch close interactions between pairs, the tips they give and the ways they don’t give and how the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has great leadership before the final day, but this session of the pairs tournament has also shown that the US team has a desire for a fight that some have doubted, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads with 10-6 ahead of the final day in the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, as after Saturday's games in the game with four balls and in the pairs' tournament, it gained a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspiring couple, Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari, led the first with two wins over unrest Tiger Woods, increasing the score so far on the Le Golf National field to four points.
European side Thomas Bjorn, who struggled to regain the trophy they lost to golf club Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the inaccurate American side in the morning game with four balls and won the series with 3-1.
The U.S. provided greater resistance to the pairs' tournament, winning two matches, but were unable to reduce the freezing.
Jim Furick has to win eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to hold the trophy.
Flytwood was the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Mollywood" after a fantastic weekend, were only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in the first four matches.
After overtaking Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then competed brilliantly and mastered the pumped Woods and the American debutant Bryson Deshamboo with an even more convincing 5-4.
Woods, who slipped through two matches on Saturday, sparkled for the moment, but has now lost 19 of 29 matches in a game with four balls and in a tournament of pairs and seven consecutively.
Justin Rose, who rested during a four-ball game in the morning, returned to partner Henry Stanson in the pairs' tournament and suffered a 2-1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brux Kepka – the first and third on the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not all go according to plan on this pleasant, velvety day southwest of Paris.
The three-time Majors winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They fought a 2-1 victory over John Ram and John Pulter in a four-ball game to later return and beat Pulter and Rory McLaren with 4-3 in the pairs' tournament, after losing the first two holes.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, some teams returned after a four-point lead before the singles match, although the Furick side, who defended the title, had enough streaks to hold the trophy.
However, after they have already been in the second place for two days, it seems that the counterattack on Sunday would be above their capabilities.
North Korea says there is “no talk” about unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
North Korea's foreign minister on Saturday told the United Nations that the extension of the sanctions deepened its distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong-ho said at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures in the past year to show goodwill", such as the breakdown of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of non-nuclear and nuclear weapons.
“However, there is no appropriate U.S. response,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no mention that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
Although Ree reiterated North Korea's renowned allegations of Washington's resistance to a "phase" approach to denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement was more significant because he did not throw out a single-sided deacon.
Rie called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the current president of the United States and the leader of North Korea on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on "denuclearization without nuclear weapons".
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean War (1950–53), but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also scoffed at calls to ease North Korea’s international sanctions.
“The United States does not give up ‘denuclearization first of all’ and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to forcefully achieve its goal, even resisting the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” he said.
“What they think sanctions can throw us on our knees is just letting people dream that don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that prolonging the sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Rie did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “Yes, we are negotiating this issue about denuclearization with South Korea and not with the United States.”
Despite this, the tone of Rio’s speech differed drastically from last year’s, when at the UN General Assembly, he said that North Korea’s U.S. land-based missile fire was inevitable after “Mr. Evil” President Trump called himself “Mr. Trump.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery to take disarmament steps, but he said that Coca-Cola does not have much more to do and that sanctions must remain.
Trump said on Wednesday he did not set a time frame for this, saying: “If it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said before the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council sanctions must continue to be strictly and unreserved until a full, final, confirmed day is reached.”
The Security Council unanimously endorsed sanctions against North Korea that have been in place since 2006, in an attempt to disable funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rome past the UN General Assembly and subsequently stated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang with words that progress had been made, so that North Korea would condemn him after just a few hours for carrying out “gangster demands”.
North Korea has pledged to dismantle its missile pole, as well as its nuclear complex, at a meeting with Moon this month, if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him that they were “appropriate measures” seeking security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Students from Harvard attend a course on how to get enough sleep
The new course at Harvard University this year is aimed at forcing students to sleep more in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular macho culture of learning “all night with the help of caffeine.”
One academic noted that university students are the number one in the world often misunderstood in terms of basic self-care.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The idea of this course was given after a speech about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“A girl came to me and said, ‘Why do I hear that just now, in my last year of study?’
She said no one ever told her how important a dream is – which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
In this course, which takes place this year for the first time, students are presented with the foundations on how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports outcomes, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at this university, says the university has decided to introduce this course after it has been noted that students during the week suffer from severe deficiency.
The one-hour course covers a range of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the room in the student's home and students should click on coffee cups, curtains, slippers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as about the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of sleep routines.
In the second part, participants hear how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe they have the right to know that – just like everyone has the right to know what the consequences of smoking cigarettes have on health,” added Professor Chaisler.
The culture of pride on “not sleeping all night” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to a lack of sleep becoming an increasingly problematic.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and that of quality, should be a “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against excess pounds, since due to lack of sleep, the brain passes into hunger mode.
Raymond Soo, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Chaisler design the course, after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He says that this course opened his eyes and encouraged him to endeavor to maintain it at the whole campus level.
The next step, as hoped, would be to ask all graduates to pass a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students consider setting alarms on time for sleep and awakening and take care of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can interfere with the circadian rhythm and thus the problem.
Liveingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga defeated Gerard's team
The Rangers experienced another guest drop when Dolly Menga sent a shot to the dismantling team of Steven Gerard in a 1-0 defeat to Livingston.
The team from Ibrox Stadium attempted to bring the first win in the guests after the February 4-1 triumph in St. John's, but the team of Gary Holt brought Gerard as manager only the second loss in 18 games, leaving his team's Labradors behind.
Menga shot seven minutes before the half-hour, and the uninspired position of Rangers never came close to equation.
While the Rangers now fall sixth, Livingstone climbs to third behind Hibernian just because of the difference in goals.
Rangers may face additional problems after linear judge Calum Spence had to show assistance due to a head injury after he was shot by some object on the side.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that crossed Ireland and placed in the Bettfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, identified himself for the same eleven Livingston players who took a Hartsima point last week and would be thrilled with the way his well-trained team put pressure on opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
Little was missing to reach the goal just two minutes after Menga's first dog sent Scott Pitman to the goal of Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a great chance and shot next to the goal.
Kegan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett with a deep free kick, but his defensive partner Alan Litgou shot next to the naked at the other stable.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the final line gave more hope than faith in themselves.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have gotten a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lowell collided, but Judge Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian claim.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox stadium goalkeeper Liam Kelly, with no major problems, defended the Lasana Colibali headshot and scored a shot that directed Ovie Eyaria.
Although Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute may not reflect the true strength ratio during the game, no one can challenge that he was deserving if anything else, then because of his hard work.
The Rangers were once again unable to cope with Jacobs' deeply involved action.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher punched the ball to Slota Robinson, who remained humble and chose Meng for a simple finish.
Gerard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Colibalius and that substitution almost immediately resulted when the wing player hired Morellos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to charge the guests to play exactly the way it suits them, with the long balls of Litgou and Halkett.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor held up well and defended Jacobs' attack, to then send Litgo from the corner with a ball next to the goal.
Glenn Middleton, Rangers' replacement, at the end of the game, asked for another penny when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thompson did not respond again.
Almanah: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Gaeger was born in Germany.
He invented the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Heather Counter.
In addition to being one of the main pillars of science, the Geiger counter has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950s film "The Bell of the Coronado," in which seemingly incredible cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, played:
The man said, “What is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on those headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: “Look, it’s really heard!”
Hans Gaeger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to Recognize Damaged Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to Recognize and Kill Defective Cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells as part of treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and altering them in the laboratory.
They can then “see” the protein that is common in many cancers, and then inject them again.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, who taught the immune system to recognize damaged cells, ovarian cancer withdrew for more than 18 months.
This method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein that occurs in many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofski of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovaries, lungs, and colon cancers, Professor Bersofski explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and their “teaching” how to target cancer cells has been well proven in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined a brutal attack in defense of Trump, wearing a hoodie with the MAGA tag, after a visit to the SNL show.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after an unrelated speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and stated that he would run for a political office in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Ghost Town", with the slogan "Make America Great", that night, he gave a fierce speech against the Democrats and backed Trump again.
“I’ve talked to white people so many times that they would say, ‘How can you support Trump when he’s racist?’
“If I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
In the show, SNL aired a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Bret Cavano's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blaise Ford.
Though not aired, comedian Chris Rock posted a video of West's brutal speech on social networks.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to make West laugh with this announcement.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of the hat he was wearing.
“They threatened me behind the scenes.
They told me, “Don’t go out with that hatchet.”
They threatened me!
And then they say I'm drowning," he said, reports the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding, "It's going to put on Superman's coat because that means you can't order me. Do you want a better world?
Then spread the love.”
The audience looked at his dangers at least twice and it seemed as if the members of the SNL show were uncomfortable, reports Variety, while one of the attendees stated for this magazine: "The whole study has gained pain."
The news recently replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West has confused many with his performance of the song "I Love It", masked in a bottle of Perrier water.
The news got the support of the leader of the TPUSA Conservative group, Candy Turner, who posted the following tweet: "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for what you didn't get in front of the evildoers."
However, TV show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “his and that’s absolutely beautiful.”
“But my choice is not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) for whom I believe he accepts and endorses an ideology that is bad for my community.
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the reper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he would now “be known as the Knight West.”
He was not the first performer to change his name – before him did Didi, also known as Puffy, Puffy and Puffy.
Another rapper, Snup Dog, was formerly called Snup Leone and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, then to an performer formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harrington Condemns Deadly Macho Culture
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as John Snow in the HBO television series "Game of Thrones" which represents a medieval fantasy full of violence.
However, the 31-year-old actor condemned the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that because of such roles on the screen, young people often feel like they have to be rude to get respect.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith expressed his view that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of the deadly macho culture in the <0x23>JaIsto era.
Keith, who recently married a partner in the Game of Thrones series, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he has a “strong need” to talk about the problem.
“I’m personally quite upset at the moment with the question – what have we wronged about representing masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men who grow up, about the problem we see now?”
Kitt believes that television may be partly responsible for spreading a deadly macho culture due to the depiction of characters depicted as men.
He added: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is it that teaches us on TV and on the streets why young people think they have to fit into a particular mold of men’s behavior?
I think that’s, in fact, one of the main questions of our time – how to change that?
“Something went wrong with the youngsters.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to the previews or sequels of the "Game of Thrones" series after its end the following summer, saying that he had "ending with battlefields and horses".
From November onwards, Kit will play Sam Shepard’s play “True West” – the story of the film’s producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently discovered that he thinks dating his current wife, Rose, is the best thing that brought him the Game of Thrones series.
“In this series, I met my current wife, so it can be said that she gave me the future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose starred in Igrit, the love partner of Kitty's character John Snow, in this fantastic series that bears Emmy's recognition.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports 14% Increase in Diseases
China has reported a jump in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS by 14%.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the virus is transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China in the past as a result of blood transfusions infected with the virus.
However, the number of people who get HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV via sex is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been considered illegal in China since 1997, but it is said that LGBT discrimination is very widespread.
Studies estimate that, due to conservative perceptions in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually get married to women.
The transmission of the virus often comes due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff had published data on GOP senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. spokeswoman Maxine Waters has denied the allegation that one of her staff posted personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of those legislators.
A Los Angeles Democrat pointed out that these claims are placed by experts and the “ultra-right wing” website.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mother Lee and Orina Hetch, from Utah.
The information appeared on the internet on Thursday and was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Commission on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Bret Cavano.
The seizure came at some point after three senators examined Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the post was linked to the Waters office and posted information about its staff member, Hill reported.
“This unfounded claim is a completely inaccurate and absolute lie,” said Waters.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and inaccurate claims – is in no way responsible for the use of this information.
This unfounded claim is a completely inaccurate and absolute lie.”
Waters' statement prompted a conviction on the Internet, which was also issued by former White House press secretary Ari Flaisher.
“This demon is going out of anger,” Fleisher wrote.
“It shows that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone accuses someone of something he hasn’t done, he shouldn’t be angry.
We can't be a bitch.
We must not question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and calm.”
Flaisher compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of acting too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran for Waters' half-term election, also announced on Twitter.
“The big thing if it’s true,” his tweet said.
Waters said her office had notified "the relevant competent institutions and judiciary authorities of these false allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered, and that they are liable before the law for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Review of the film "Johnny English - Again in Action" – a soft satirical spy movie with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to seek a subtext about Brexit in every new film with a British theme, which can also be applied to this sequel to the franchise of satirical action comedies about Johnny Ingles: The Return of the Ingles – which was started in 2003 by Ingles and the Achievement of the Ingles.
Will the ironic autosatisfaction about what we are obviously will be the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the bully, incompetent Johnny Ingles with a face like a rubber got a new chance to smuggle something – his name reveals more than anything that it is a general comic creation designed for the territory of which the cinematic poetry is not.
It is, of course, about a clumsy secret agent in 2012 who, despite bizarre claims at the highest glamour, carries a little Kluzoa, the crown of Mr. Bin and the skull of that guy who played Lopiyi's Lopiyi's only one note and played on the theme song of the "Chareriots".
It is also originally based on a traveler and a mysterious man in international settings that Atkinson once starred in now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos behind.
In this latest sequel about Johnny Inglesh there are also a few scenes worth mentioning.
I liked it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades briefly ring about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor is rather soft and unusually superficial, especially considering that "serious" film brands, such as "007" and "Impossible Mission", now regularly include and commute.
Humor leaves the impression as if it was foreseen for children, not for adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny Inglesh’s distracted misfortunes are not as inventive and elaborate to dance as Atkinson’s gigs in the style of non-films when he played Bin.
Now it is a very topical topic that the UK is in serious trouble.
The cyber-hacker infiltrated the UK’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the horrific agent in charge – unfortunately, small roles for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the premiere, a pompous and combative character, who is already experiencing a complete collapse due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson has masterfully played this character designed by Teresa May, but the script is rather poor.
Intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies are compromised and that she will have to hire one of the retired.
It's a head and beard-wrapped Johnny Inglesh, who now works as a teacher at a cancelled institution, but unofficially holds lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting geeks when Inglesh provides an academy for spying in the spirit of the film.
Ingles returns to Whitehall for instructions by emergency procedure and reunites with his former patient assistant, Bau, who is reinterpreted by Ben Miller.
Bau is now a married man, married to the commander-in-chief of the submarine, interpreting Vicky Peperdin, which is a little bit superfluous.
And so Batman and Robin are sluggish and incompetent again in action in the secret service of Her Majesty and fortunately beautiful femme fatale Olga Kurilenko, Ofelia Boulettova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: the malicious Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
Ingles and Bau begin their odyssey of comic events: dressed in a conobar, they lighted up a sparkling French restaurant, a real chaos sweeping onto a Volta luxury yacht and Ingles launches a real anarchy in order to get to know Voluna.
Obviously, a great deal of effort has been invested in that last sequence, but no matter how cute and fun, the entire film looks like it was made for children.
Pretty average quality.
As with other films about Johnny England, I can’t help but wonder: can the British film industry make up a role for Rowan Atkinson that would justify his talent?
Labour Party denies making a plan for British women to work four days a week and be paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn should consider a radical plan for the British to work four days a week – and be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company’s bosses to shift the time to workers who are saving thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving them an extra day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend like this – but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say that the idea would be “integrated” into the party’s economic program and plans to improve working conditions and workers’ rights.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “It expects everything to be under the guise of the hooded manuscripts.
"We're not going to go out of the way tonight, but the next day's goal is not to include all of us in the approach of the party, and we're going to go out of our way to get the money."
The Labour Party was not the first to accept such a move, the Green Party's all-rounder was due to the fact that it was not a day-to-day campaign for the 2017 general election campaign.
However, at the moment, such a tendency is not part of the Labour Party's reading.
The Labour Party's spokesman said: "The first day of the week is not a part of the party's program, and the party is not a part of the program."
The Senate Minister John McDonald's has called for a pro-Labour confederation in order to bring out his vision of the Socialist Revolution in a row. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Mr. McDonald's insisted on the decision to verify the presence of "inappropriate directors" and "profiters" in public premises.
The minister's plans at the summit as soon as they come to the meeting of the three current shareholders in the next two-year-old company will not be able to reach their full-fledged U.S. government if they do not.
In addition, he confirmed the plans for the acquisition of 500-year-olds in the first half of the world's competitors and the production of the Inclusive Flow Funds, by means of which 10-year-olds would have been awarded.
Lindsay Greeham and John Kennedy have been talking about "60 Minutes" if they could think about the FBI's investigation into the Cavano case.
I don't think the FBI's prosecution's prosecution's prosecution's prosecution's prosecution's prosecution's prosecution's prosecution's prosecution's prosecution's prosecution's prosecution.
In an interview on the show, the author of the show "60 Minutes" by Scott Peeley was interviewed by a public senator, John Kennedy, and Lindsay Griejem, who had been interviewed by the BBC.
Kendy's been a member of his college from South Karoline, South Karoline.
"I think so," said Kenny. "I think so."
“I told you, when I was going to listen to you, I told you that I was going to talk to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when he found out what he was doing, when he called the police, and he said, "Did you get that?"
"It's a decision, it's a decision, it's a decision."
However, it seems that Grey's glas is included in the room.
"I've made my decision about Bret Cavan, and it wouldn't have been a pre-explosive indictment," he said.
“I don’t know what Dr. Ford was all about, but here I know: Brett is his decision,” Greyham said, thinking of Christine Blazey Ford.
“And no one has ever been able to prove it to him, and no one has been able to prove it.
It's been since the age of 36.
"I don't think I'm going to have anything to do with it."

Organizers of the Global Grounds claim that since 2011, more than 19 million shares of their own landscapings have been targeted in order to achieve a number of targets.

I think I was pushed into the ruins of the wall," said Harris of the Asoshijeted Pradesh, claiming that he and his family had come to the city for the wedding celebration.
“I’ve heard my wife say, ‘I’m tired, and I’m still crying.’
I don't know what was going on with her, and what was going on with her.
I don't know they're good."
The U.S. Embassy accuses China of "disappearing in pro-democracy talks"
Just a few days ago, a typical Chinese newspaper reported that a black-and-white rheklama in a single diary from the U.S.A., highlighting both sides of the U.S. trade, and the U.S. trade in the U.S.A.

Trump's allegations that Beijing had tried to interfere in the U.S.A. were based on what the U.S. officials described to Royters as a new phase of the war in the U.S. military.
While it's not normal for the parties to express their opinions in order to promote trade, Peking and Washington are, at the moment, shaping up in a shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky.
The goal of China's foreign tariffs in the current phase of the trade war was to enable the exit from the state such as Ajovea, which is in the hands of the Trump administration, the Republican Party, and the Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. President in China and former long-time Gov. Ajovee, who is one of the leading producers of agricultural products in China, said that the company is a peking company.
As Brenstad wrote in a volume in the current edition of the Dimoon Register, Kinna "we've added to the film's explanations of the preconceived remarks in our own book."
"On the other hand, the Chinese government is responsible for the use of the U.S. drag-and-shoulder tradition in both the world and the world," he said, explaining the situation in the United States.
"On the other hand, we're going to go to a kiosk with us on the street in Peking, and we're going to have to go to the other side, and we're not going to see anyone coming to the other side."
He said that "one of the unreported Chinese lists has refused to offer an explanation" of his past, but he didn't know which list he's on.
Analysts have advised that all public figures who are displaced from women's voters should be taken out of the majority of the voters, and that they should be handed over to the Judge Kawânoom.
I'm sure you're going to have to go to the top of the list, but I'm not going to go to the top of the list, I'm going to go to the top of the list, I'm going to go to the top of the list, I'm going to go to the top of the list.
Emotions related to this situation are exceptionally unpleasant, and the majority of the Republicans already know that they want to pay their respects to him.
Such industries are impossible to attract," said Grant Rieger, professor of political science at the Maxwell Faculty of Science at the University of Syracuse, a member of the University of Syracuse, in a press release.
Richard has raised suspicions that Senator Jeff Flayk (Arizona) will insist on investigating the FBI in the next minute to be alone in order to kill an injured gangster.
"No one will be able to pay attention to what they've paid for - they won't be able to pay attention to it either in the morning or in the evening," said Karin Jean-Pierre, the chief of staff.
The Demonstrants called out in the morning, "Come on, let's go!" until they were tested in the Senata's diary, when they were re-publics, when they were re-written, they were re-written, they were re-written, they were re-written, they were re-written, they were re-written, they were re-written, they were re-written, they were re-written, they weren-written, they weren-written, and they were, and they weren-written, and they weren-
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will share a sense of pleasure,” said St. Rothenberg, a political activist in the New York Times, in a press release.
“People say that it’s already on its high level, it’s starting.
But it can also be easier, especially among non-partisan women's players from predators and younger players, from the age of 18 to 29, if you don't want to play the game.'
As in the case of a public witness, in the case of a Ford's, it's now described as a sex-taking out of the ranks of a court of law, a court of law, a court of law.
"This has been in the form of a major dissolution of the Republican Party," he said in a press release for the N-B-S-News Michael Style, a former president of the Republican Party.
"I don't know if you're going to have a vote or a vote or if you're going to end up in court, I don't know if you're going to go to court, I don't know if you're going to go to court or not."
It seems, however, that the Americans are inclined to question who they are to be seen as the witnesses of the Fordove and the Cavanoa, with nothing more than those witnesses.
In the meantime, we're going to have to say that we're going to have to do a lot of research, but we're going to have to do a lot of research, and we're going to have to do a lot of research.
With that, 38 out of them have the right to believe that the Cavâno is a veritable or definitive lagae in their own country, while 30 out of their thoughts are from the Ford.
Not insisting on Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations that Ford was excluded, as well as that of at least one person, Deborah Ramirez, Gardjan reported.
I'm not going to go out of my way to get a witness in front of the Court of Appeal that I'm going to be in for a 17-year-old. I'm not going to go out of my way.
Ramirez claims that she was a candidate for the Supreme Court's supremacy because of her genealogy at the time of the party to which she attended during her 1980s study at Yale.
The World Wide Web (World Wide Web) is planning to create a new internet, as if it were opposed to Google and Facebook . . .
Tim Burners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is the launch of a project that aims to build a Facebook, Amazon, and Google rivals.
The Najnovskiy project is a project of this new venture, "Inrupt", which is designed by the Berners-Lyjevskaya Plattformi, which was created by the Slovak Republic.
Solid clients will be able to choose where they will be able to protect themselves, and how they will be able to access the information they need, and how they will be able to access the information they need.
In an exclusive investment for the writing of the Fast Companion, Berners-Lee noted that it was not the case that he was responsible for the project of the Inrupt "world dominance".
"I'm going to have to kill him," he said to the star.
"It's an Eastern moment."
The application of using that technology Solid to allow people to create their "personal proprietorship for the purpose of protecting the individual's life," or POD.
It can contain listings of counts, listings of reasons, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional records. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
That's how Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one view.
What is unity for personal reason is the unity of the individual's ability to understand why it is that the exclusion from the user depends on how it is able to access the information that is being transmitted.
As a result, it is called “personally assessed through the lens of the feet.”
He's going to Inrupt, as General Director John Bruce has said, that the company's ability to use resources, resources, and resources will be used in the future as a way of learning how to do it.
The company is currently headquartered in Berners-Lyon, Bruce, and has purchased an unprecedented fleet of I-B-Ems, a few of which are still underway from the airport.
I've learned from this, that the programmers across the world can make a decentralized application of the decentralized community by means of a number of inputs available to the Infrastructure.
"Berners-Lee and his team will not be able to talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not they're going to get a full-fledged look at who's going to get their hands on it.
“I don’t want to call them.”
In response to the sub-committee's plan for the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt "is my mission to provide a common energetic and eco-friendly solution to the problem."
Berners-Lee was born in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts, Massachusetts.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee was one of the most influential glaciers in the debating of the neutrality of the Internet.
As a launcher of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Corporation, the Web Foundation, and the Institute of Developed Authorities.
"I'm very optimistic about this new year's resolution," Berners-Lee said in a statement.
Bernadette Van: Did you give a witness from the First World War, the narrator of the Victorian Cross? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
One of the members of the Church of England, where the Victorian Cross was handed over to the people of the First World War, was given a 100-year-old crown of gold in its own right. . . .
On September 29, 1918, the detachment of police officers, Bernard Wan, served in the detachment of the Belanglish and Leokura codes.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper, and no one knew he had ever been able to survive the British war since then.
Her two grandchildren in the subsoil were discovered by a spooky spoon in the grounds of Rashden in Northamptonshire.
One of her grandchildren, Michael Wan, said that it was "brilliantly symbolic" because it was a fact that she had been uncovering it for over a hundred years. It's been a long time since she was born.
The London Gazette, September 29, 1918, led by Lieutenant-General Van Poughkeepsie, to his death at the Battle of Saint-Quentin's "crossing the border and the borders of the North."
Then he slipped on the guard's line, and with the "nearly unity" he pulled back to the ground, which was only a matter of time, followed by an artillery squadron and a triathlete.
Vana was assassinated on October 4, 1918, by a gunman who was killed, so that it was not more than a month before his death.
Michael Van, aged 72, said that the actions of her husband had been "something I didn't know I wasn't able to do, but I couldn't do anything I didn't want to do."
He and his brother, Dr. James Wan, came to the scene when the coyote was headed by the Imperial Ombudsman's Orchestra in Brentwood.
"Michael Van has said that all the "community's work is due to what he's been doing on the road" and he has said that "it's the right thing to do for a man who's democracies."
The MMA's officers stayed awake at night to vote for Bill 206, and instead called it "Pepa Prasace."
Imagine that they would have stayed up all night to vote for the Bill 206, and that they would have been able to vote for the Bill 206, and that they would have been able to vote for the general election.
In San Hosea, he included 13 fights, including a sixteen in the lead role, and in the UK, he was featured live on the night of Kanal 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald agreed to make sure everything was going well, the U.K.'s guards came to the scene as soon as they were ready.
Some of them were the reason why they'd been awake for the next morning, and you'd have to worry about it.
One of the commentators on Twitter's preface to the cartoons described it as "a kind of skeleton that is not a skeleton."
"At 6:00 a.m., the meeting was not scheduled to take place, but it was necessary for the children to attend the program," said Dave Schwartz, a senior member of the board of directors.
"Pepa Prase, yes."
The President of the Complaints, Bellator Schott Cocker, has said that he will guide her in her own program scheme as if she would in the future include a gleedaoce from the UK.
"I think it's going to be a surprise, I think we'll be able to do it all the time," Cocker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning, and I'm not going to be able to cut it out for the rest of the day, for the rest of the day, for the rest of the day.
But I've done it for you.
Trust me, as soon as I got to the office, I got my phone number and they weren't all welcome.
They've tried to get it out of the way, they think it's technically in the middle of a fight.
But it wasn't, it was a problem with the government.
I can assure you that I won't be able to do it the next time.
We're going to be holding on to the ball instead of the sixth—as is the usual dream—as we've been trying to give it more than the usual and the one-time thing we're going to do.
"There's an emergency situation in question."
Dezert ajlend disc: Tom Daley's "inferior" of sexuality
Olympic rookie Tom Daley says that he's almost done with the information on the other day of his sexuality - but that's what motivates him to do. . . .
These 24-year-olds, who went to higher education in a single school, didn’t realize that “not everyone is like him.”
In episode 4 of the first edition of the Diezert Allend Disc by Laurent Laverne, he was told that he was going to be "as good as anyone else would be" as he was.
He's been saying that he's been taking care of the Olympics since he's been a rookie.
The original director of the long-term emission, Kirsty Yang, has taken almost the place of the absence of the two-year-old.
Given the impression of a person in the first broadcast of April, Daley decided that he would feel "weird" from the rest of the world's viewpoints until he was out of his mind "because he wasn't there."
He said, "Until today, the feeling that I had the time and that I had the other, that it was the industrial industries that gave me the opportunity and the opportunity to succeed."
He wanted to make sure that it was "nothing and nothing," he said, as if he weren't going to make up his mind as soon as he could find out about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic medalist, who was awarded a medal for the LGBT law, has been sworn in by the two-time winner of the Olympics, and has made his way to the next year's Commonwealth Games.
When he realized that he had felt that he could live from the ground up, without the help of a man, and that he wanted to give to others the "nothing" to him.
The three-time World Champion has been "expensively" in love with the male, american director Dastin Lens Blake, who was introduced to him in 2013.
Daley's last day was about 20-years-old, and she's still a little older than she was, but she's still in the middle of the day, and she doesn't have a problem.
"When he came through the pulpit, he went to the first Olympiad at the age of 14, and his father died at the age of three years later, he went to the first Olympiad at the age of 14, and his father died at the age of three years later.
The two of them had a rhodithel in June, they had the son of Roberto Reeh Blake-Deely, and Daley had told him that he had "read the pre-emptive."
"If I were to be questioned by the next gentleman, I would have been like, 'I need to understand the evil monster,'" he said.
"But you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're more important than the olympic gold medals.
"Robby is my gold medal in the Olympics."
Her son, who was born in Kaohsiung, and her father, Robert Koey, died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being discovered to have a brain tumor.
Dale says that her father didn't accept that she was going to die and that one of her children's last questions was whether she had ever had a card for the Olympics in Lund in 2012. He was the first to go to the Olympics in London.
"I couldn't have told him, 'Now, you're not going to be in the first place,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he was about to breathe, and when he was about to breathe, and when he died, I began to realize that he was not able to breathe," he said.
And then Mr. Daley went to the 2012 Olympics, and he saw the bronze.
“I only knew that it was what I had been talking about all my life – that I was in front of the audience at the Olympic Games, and that it wasn’t the best thing I could ever do,” he said.
This feeling was also inspired by the selection of the first song "Praad" by Heather Smool, which was re-introduced by him to the Olympics, and from where he and I went.
The Diezert Allend broadcasts on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 p.m. in the U.K. in the evening.
Is there a way to get out of the locker room in the locker room for a scooter?
U.S. President Phil Miquelson will be back in no time after he scored his 47th match against the Rajder Cup, but he'll have to wait until he's in the foreground like that.
Michaelson, the 12th time he's been teaching in this two-year high school, Captain Jim Furick has gone to the baseball club. He's been playing for four years now, and he's been playing for four years.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as it was so much in the U.S., the five-time champions will be able to get the most out of it and get the most out of it and the most out of it.
If we weren't at the top of the list, we wouldn't be more inclined to do so in a very difficult situation, but this 48-year-old wouldn't have been able to do anything to get the "Le Gulf Knicks" out of the box.
And if you don't want to be a full-fledged man, you're going to be in the middle of the game, you're going to be in the middle of the game, you're going to be a British champion, you're going to be French.
If the U.S., which is four times the size of the 12-day championships, were to have a squad, Michaelsson's championship would have been the most likely to happen.
Forrick insisted that he had the power to do something in his own home, even though he couldn't do anything else for me.
"In the end, he understood how much he had today, he took me as much as he could, he hugged me, and he said he would be ready for the morning," said Furick.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
His name is in the Land of the Dead, and he has contributed much to these tits in the past, as well as here and there.
I don't think I'm going to play it for a couple of days.
I've planned more, but as soon as it's gone and that's the way we've decided that we need to go.
He wanted to be the same, the same, and the same."
Michaelson will be in charge of Nicka Faldoo's re-election in order to increase the number of teams raised in the Ryder Cup.
It could be just one carrier in Raydder a bunch of people who didn't even get to the top of their personal ranks.
Michaelson was 18 years old, 20 years old, and I haven't been able to do it, but Furyk hasn't been in the team yet.
"He's a savage, sarcastic, spiritual man, he likes to have all the people and he's been able to have him in the team's ranks," he explained.
"I think the younger players have enjoyed the opportunity to play it, and that's not to say that it was a good thing to watch.
"He's more than just playing the game with me."
The European Union's president, Tomás Bjorn, has said that the EU's willingness to stand up to the
European captain Tomás Bjorn, from his experiences, knew that the readiness for the next day's football matches in Rajd<0xC3><0xA6>r was a lot more than he could possibly have done in the past.
The day started in 1997 at the World Cup, where the two sides of the game had a preview of Sevee Balestero's preview of the game from the 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2pm to the 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2pm of the Americans.
"I don't think we're going to be able to do anything in 2018, but we're going to be able to do something about it; we're going to be able to do something about Brooklyn, where we're going to lose it, and we're going to be able to do something about it."
Daclee, I'm going to make sure that both me and everyone in the team isn't there.
In the morning, I'm going full-time.
Let's get out of there and get everything done as we need it.
There's nothing wrong with it until there's nothing wrong with it.
There's a goal, and that's to try to spot this trophy, and that's gonna keep the focus on it.
"I'm going to focus on the 12 players on the other side, but I'm going to focus on the 12 players on the other side, and I'm going to focus on the other side as well," he said.
Intrigued by the gameplay of his players on the chess golf course, Bjorn said: "If I didn't run to the mine, I'd run to the mine where it was going.
The morning's just got another one.
In the morning, the individual acts as a result of the shooter, and this is due to the game of the other.
It's a good idea to be that partner when you're working on it as you need it, but when you're working on it, you're going to have to take your full golf course exam.
It's a cocoon that's supposed to direct the players, pull the bullets out of the net.
"It's like he's going to have to get out of his way, and he's going to have to get out of his way."
Fortunately for Bjorn, the captain of the team, Jim Furick, will be asking his players to do a better job than the other three-year-olds, and they'll be able to do a full-time job.
And I'm sure Furick was one of those big moves in the aftermath of the day, the first one in the general team at Brooklyn, and the second one was the "loser" in the Euro.
"I've been literally all over the place," he was asked when Ben Cranshoe, a captain of 1999, raised a handful of his players to the point where they were all alone.
"I've had 12 matches in the morning, but it would have been good if I had a quick stroll along the path of one coyote to see Brooklyn and one coyote to see Medina.
As soon as the sun rises in a single ray, the pressure of the sun's rays is exercising on the hearth of the moon.

Tommaso's been out for a long time trying to get ahead of the propulsion and point all the way to Rory MacKillroy in the final match, with Polla Kaysey, Justin Roosevelt, and Jonna Roosevelt.
"I've decided with this group of people in that meeting that I think we've been blaming our own bodies," Bjorn said in a statement to the audience's press release.
Don't you think it's a good idea to use the new boots?
I'd like to say that I don't want to go out on the road, but I'd like to say I'm going to go out on the road, I'm going to go out on the road, I'm going to go out on the road, I'm going to go on the road, I'm going to go on a trip, I'm going to go on a trip, I'm going to go on a trip, I'll go.
He's going to take Raynland-Falca, he's going to bring the new club back to Baden-Württemberg, when he's out for the first half of 2019, and he's coming to the top of the list.
Plovdiv was expected to join the Mornarics in 2014, but with the help of the expeditions, the future of this ambitious project was clarified.
The four plovials of Baden-Württemberg's death were handed over to Mornaricz in 2007, and this year the fraternity of Bremen's death will be resurrected.
It is known that it will be able to help a large number of people, a number of pioneering and pioneering markets, as well as other industries, such as technologie, as well as other industries, such as the economy and the economy.
In addition to the fact that there is a long period of time in which there is no maintenance, there is a need to be able to re-enter the utility of the utility of the utility.
However, there is a constant need to know that these newly-inhabited rivers – which it is necessary for Nema<0xC4><0x8D>ka to be able to steer their way in, to be able to steer their way into the water.
The malnourished F125 fleet is located in a new town in the northeastern part of the country, where it is not possible for Mornaricz to have a regular duty to take a ploy and turn it over.
It was the first time that Mornarice's shipment was shipped to the ship's landing site after the shipment.
I don't know much about what we're doing, but I don't think we've had more cruises than we've ever had to do with the sophisticated and hard-working things we're going to do.
The sophisticated approaches were unprecedentedly important, as it would have been possible for the Baden-Württemberg team to take part in the project from the start of the 120th century to the end of the year.
In addition, it has been proven that the length of the hill is a drastic predator, which would entail a perforation of it and the possibility of a Mornarice's coming to an end.
The "Rajnland-Falz" was supposed to be 7,000 tons of double-tone from the shores of similar claus that the Germans used in the Second World War.
For the purpose of a fake hardwire, the length of the read project – including the length of the footage – is how it is possible to prepare for the problem.
I think it’s worth less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) – out of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
It's the only thing that's ever made sense to me is the fact that it's the only way I've ever been able to do anything about it, and it's the only way I've ever done anything about it.
Earlier this day, Hans-Peter Barthels, the chief of staff for his visit to the Parliament, confirmed to the Mornary's office that he was "off the coast" of the island.
This journal has insisted that the problem of the mosque is more serious and more serious, since the shores of the mosque are mosqued without the introduction of the mosque's mosque.
He expressed his grief that one of the brothers of Baden-Württemberg's family had not succeeded in joining the Mornarics.
The national background listens to the theatrical livelihood of sleepy mice
No research has been carried out on the basis of a single property in the Scottish Highlands, with the aim of detecting how the colors of the mouse greyhounds are exacerbated in the future.
Scientists are hoping that we will be able to work together in the new world in order to bring these unified youngsters together, and to help them to cope with the upcoming Activities of the World.
Scientists from the National Fund for Scotland's Commonwealth will look at the muscles and muscles of the body, as well as the muscles of the eye, the eyes, and the nose of the nose, and the nose of the nose.
The social media for the recording will be influenced by the key locations of a wide range of properties in order to increase the activity of the sleeps of the mouse during the session.
In addition, the National Health Service of Scotland (NHS) will also be conducting mobile exams with hand-held detectorims.
An expert analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the glimpse of the sounds of the mouse and the kind of thing it is made of.
Then there's going to be a place where you're going to stay, with the exception of how you're going to get a picture of their workouts in the day we're going to die.
Rob Djwar, the Conservation Counsellor, comes to the Fond, as soon as the results are found to be more relevant to the fact that they're still alive and that they're still alive.
This information will contribute to the improvement of the readiness of the public to do so as to ensure that, in the same way, it is possible for the public to do so in the same way that it does not do so in any other way.
The brilliance of sleep mice in Scotland and across the UK has been spotted in the vicinity of the river.
They're being treated with bitterness and bitterness, and they're being affected by their resentment and loss of stability.
The researchers and the researchers have shown that there is a risk that the risk, as well as the risk of inflammation, and some types of chemical reactions that cause inflammation of the brain and other organs may be present in the brain.
Sleeping mice in the stalls are not sleepy.
However, because of their nocturnal lyrical habits, their ears are more precious than their eyes when it comes to catching up with them.

The NTS Koji Foundation is responsible for the care of about 270 grams of ice from the east coast, 38 weights of ice, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, allowing for serious damage.
The fund has a number of trained professionals in the field of research, research and research, and research, and in the field of co-operation, as well as in-depth actions.
This organization is as successful as it was the first and only human resource for a few mice in Scotland, but it has a tendency to be in the hands of Damfries and Galloway, who are in the middle of the night.
He's got a coach named Dave Thompson who's been here because he's going to be a terrorist.
"Here in Triv, I have an excellent experience of sleeping in the mouse," she said.
“There are rows of rows, along the rows of trees, and in the whole row of rows of rows.
But I don't know what I'm talking about, I don't know what I'm talking about, I don't know what I'm talking about, I don't know what I'm talking about, I don't know what I'm talking about, I don't know what I'm talking about, I don't know what I'm talking about, I don't know.
It's the most important thing to do is to check the presence of sleeping mouse before it's taken out to keep it in a glass of water, and it's the accidental destruction of one of the four-year-olds.
Sleepy mice are protected, and they are motivated to kill them, to master them, or to torment them, and to destroy their hostilities.
Elizabeth Ferell, a Scottish official at the Fond for the Protection of Sleepy Mouse, encourages the public to include and contribute to it.
She said, "And I need you to learn about your sleepy minds, and I'm a little bit of my own, and I don't know how I'm going to sleep."

Christian Ronaldo described the allegations of raping her as a "little news" by insisting that people "would like to promote" her by using her own name. . . .
It's just that they're trying to find out what they're trying to do, and they're trying to figure out what they're saying.
According to Juventus and Portugal, he was accused of raping a U.S. woman under the name Katherine Majorga in the 2009 Las Vegas Hockey Hall of Fame.
Soon after she was bailed <0x24>375,000 as if she hadn't been informed of the incident, Spiegel reported it to the police.
With a total of 142 million entries in "Instagram Layv" seen as a reflection of the allegations, Ronaldo (33) is the author of the statement as "a lie".
“No, no, no, no, no.
That's what they're talking about today, we're not going to know," he said in the room of the watchdog's eyebrows.
"I'd like to make a name for myself by calling my name.
That's not normal.
She wants to make a lot of money so she's going to get my name out, but that's what it's all about.
"I'm a good guy and he's all right," the footballer said with a smile.
The plaintiffs filed an appeal against Speigl's lawsuit, which they described as "an unacceptable report on the suspicions of intrigue," according to Roy Roy.
In the meantime, Christian Shertz has said that the footballer is going to have to ask for the opening of the game "something that's important in the design of the game, and that's the size of the game, that's what it's all about.
The incident took place in June 2009 at a park in the Palms and Cassinos in Las Vegas, California, and was reported to have taken place.
When he was at the club tonight, Ronaldo and Majorga were all turned to the player's room in the morning, where he was in the morning when he went to the other side of the street, the first thing he said.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo was behind the incident at the time of the colle, claiming that he was "99 years old" but that he had let go of those "one years old".
In the document, he claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex before, but that he was in the middle of the night, and that he was in the middle of the night.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police for a photocopy of her friends in the newspaper, but that she hasn't been able to "accept" her "uncleanness" and that she's still a "unclean" person.
The 34-year-old is still trying to get a job done, but she's still trying to get a job done, and she's trying to get a job done.

Brexit: UK 'why wouldn't have complained' about the loss of a car manufacturer
The UK “why would it not have complained” if Brexit had lost the status of world leader in the automotive development, as Minister Greg Klark said in a statement.
He said he was "concerned" about what Toyota UK had said about the BBC that in the event that Britain would leave the EU without a scrutiny, the U.K. would have taken a deeper look at it.
"I need a sporazoom," Clarke said.
A Japanese automotive manufacturer has said that in the case of Brexit without a sporazoma, it would have caused the loss of precarious positions to the grenades.
The factory in Barnaston – which produces all kinds of auris and avenesis – has produced about 150,000 cars in the past year, of which 90% have been exported to the islands of Europe.
“My wish is that we will have a sweeping release in the fabrik if Britain is to leave the EU with a sweeping war,” said Marvin Cook, director of the Tojotine fabrik in Barnaston.
Residents of automotive manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, Be-Em-We, and Jaguar Land Rover, have emitted columns from the U.S. exit without any traces of functionality.
Be-em-wee, for example, will soon be after Brexit on the moon to set up his own Marke Minnie's factory in Oxford.
In the case of Brexit, it's a matter of concern to the public that we're at risk of losing our country's economy in the event of Brexit without a sporadic, I'm looking for a car dealership.
Toyota's production line operates as a "start-in-time" principle, where the parts for hand-held cars arrive at their destination within 37 minutes from the UK and the EU's suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a visa on March 29, it will be possible for the next generation of grenades for industry-leading enterprises to be able to move to the next generation and nowhere.
Toyota wouldn't be able to make an investment for more than one day in her factory in Darbyshire, the company is a municipality, which would have been the result of a restructuring.
Clarence says that Tereze May of Chequers's plan to import all of the EU's future shares is "precisely calibrated as if it were to avoid such a threat to the smugglers."
"I need a sporazoom. I want a more powerful sporazoom that will allow me to, as I would have it, not only the three-year-old's success, but also the three-year-old's."
"It's not just about the Toyota, it's not about the other producers, it's about the fact that we've got to be in a position to be in a position to do what we've done."
Toyota doesn't seem to be able to find out how much he's likely to lose, but it's important that we're going to have to wait a little longer for him to get out of the way.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been in Barnaston for 24 years and is a functioning member of the Union Union of the United Nations in the fabrik, is more concerned with his or her own concerns, as well as with his or her own concerns: “I am not alone.
The spokesman said: "We have come up with a precise and persuasive plan for the future of the EU in the future."
Trump's hour with Rosenstay's will be able to be enlarged, I'm going to the White House.

Russia's long-running military presence in the area of the Soviet Union in the wake of the assassination of Roberto Maler's military co-operation with the Russian Federation is undermining Russia's involvement in the conflict, including the re-election of the Russian military forces and the Russian forces.
He asked whether Trump was going to discourage the Supreme Court of Appeal or not, and whether he was going to discourage Maler's independence, and whether he was going to discourage the people of the country.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rozenstay had been discussing the position of the listener for the recordings of the .25-year-old's . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Rozhenstayn's been out that night.
But the chief of staff went to Bela's house, despite the fact that he was trying to get her to stay in the house.
In the meantime, at the time of Trump, when he was in the U.S.A. in New York City, he was scheduled for the fourth quarter of the year.
I don't think it's a good idea to say that you don't want to go to the airport, but it's a good time to go to the airport, and it's a good time to go to the airport, and it's a good time to go to the airport.
The Trump administration has conducted a one-off FBI investigation on the grounds of Kavanaugh's allegations, extending the Senate's allotment to the Senate.
Trump's shampoo counterpart, Sarah Sanders, has been unveiling all of us when Fox re-enacted it.
When asked about Rosenstay, she said: "If it wasn't a good date, it would be nice to be here one day, it would be nice to be here, and it would be nice to be there for another day, if only one day.
"We'll see, I'll see, I'll see, I'll see, I'll see, I'll see, I'll see, I'll see."
Some lawmakers might be able to base this claim: Sanders hasn't held a shampoo in the White House since September 10, 2015. . . .
You see, Chris Wallace's been asking for that.
Sanders's decision was that the purpose of the general meeting was not to be a result of the need to "attract attention," but that it was "I wouldn't pay attention to it," but it was: "I wouldn't pay attention to it."
So it's not that it's going to be able to push the direct counter between the Trump and the Novinar.
"The President has a higher confederation in the first two years of his life than the other President's predecessor's predecessor's predecessor's predecessor's predecessor's predecessor's predecessor's resignation."
And it's going to be all over again, it's Sanders' fault, but "if you're going to have a chance to ask the U.S. president directly, he's going to be there for you.
"I've been trying to get this out of the way, and I've seen that we've been in the process of doing it all over the place, and I'm going to have to do it all over the place, and I'm going to be doing it all over the place."
The President of the United States of America will be asked by the President of the United States of America for a visit to the White House or when he is teaching in an open meeting or a new congress of the United States of America.
It's the only confederation for the shampoo that's the place.
The President is now in New York City, and he's not going to be able to do that, but he's going to be there for the first time, and he's going to be there for us, and we're going to be there.
The Ministry of the Treasury has written a letter from the EU to the National Treasury Service of the Scottish Republic with a letter from Brexit.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote to a person from the EU who was working at the National Intelligence Service of Scotland as a way of clarifying the situation of his country's population and of calling them to their attention.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jean-Freeman, wrote a letter at a time when he had been suspended for six months for exiting the UK from the EU.
The Scottish authorities have already agreed that they will cover the cost-effective applications for the EU's deficiency of co-operation in their non-profit public services, and that the EU's deficiency of the deficiency of the EU's deficiency of the EU's deficiency of the EU's deficiency of the EU's policies.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “The leaders of the UK’s expulsion from the EU have continued throughout the course of the year, going as far as the expected decision of Jesus is concerned.
But the U.K. government is coming to us to give us the opportunity to make a possible scenario without the possibility of a sporazoma.
I know that this is a safe place to be for the rest of your life.
That's why I'm here to help you as much as I can to make your own personal contribution, without the need to take into account our nationality.
As part of the EU's broader and broader sectors, we also have a dragoonful experience and a deepening of our appreciation and appreciation for the quality of our services, as well as for our customer service.

Lajnbeeker Tennessee's state of affairs Christian Aberkroomby has been deployed urgently as he has been able to get a glimpse of the submarine's response to the 31st of July.
Tennessee's three-year-old son, Rod Reed, said he'd have to wait until he'd been able to get in for a while.
“He came up to this line and there he just cobbled up,” Reid said.
Thirty-three and a medical man gave Abercrombie the oxygen in the car just as soon as they put her on the nose and took her for her exams.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Neshville, Tennessee that Abbercrombie was being trained at the Vanderbilt Medical Center as a biopsy.
Harris said that "there's still no information on the type/seriousness of the case" and that Tennessee was trying to find out when it came to the case.
Abercrombie, the red dress of the second generation, is currently in the first division of Tennessee after the Frenchman from Illinois.
In the submarine, he had five rounds before he left the game, which he had accumulated on the edge of the rounds in the course of the 18th century.

The four-and-a-half-year-old Scots enjoyed the season's revival of the club's all-time coyote is currently in the third place in the first league, three points from the top.
This year, he went to the State of the Union after St. Mirren's return to the Scottish Premiership League, and he'd found out about it.
"I want to play for my son-in-law as a footballer.
I've been in the B-Team and that's it," Ros said of the Sportsaund show on the Scottish BBC Show.
“But I had to wait for the Scotsman to come to Hempden until I was there, and that was nothing I had ever wanted to do with it.
However, it would be a good opportunity for me to be the only one who has succeeded in bringing the club together."

Ailey Doyle will be a “Glass of Atlético” in Scotland’s Atlético Oblast
Eagle Doyle was appointed to the Scottish Council of the Scottish Atlantic Council as the executive director of the annual general meeting of the federation of the Scottish Council of the Scottish Parliament.
Doyle is an unpredictable member of the Scottish Athletics and Predicting Ijaan Beethoven who described this as a great opportunity for those who have come to the end of the world and who have come to the end of the world.
"We have enjoyed a large number of Atlético federations in Scotland, the UK, and across the world, and we are confident that the Atlético federation in Scotland will have a wide range of advantages," he said.
Doyle said: "I want to be an Athlete, and I'll do my best to help and support the introduction of the sporta in Scotland."

However, Elvie's pump is pumped out of nowhere, with no wires or wires and stands in the chest for the sake of the dough, so that the woman will be able to take care of her movement, and keep her away from her, and she will be able to take care of her own.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director at the Mother Campaign, said: “Pumpa Elvie is a very influential person who has been a part of the project and has been a part of the project.
By pulling the parallel between breastfeeding in women and cows we wanted to highlight in the foreground the breastfeeding and the challenges it brings with it, as well as to present the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides in a way that is fun and that women can cope with.
This is not the first time that Elvie Pump has reached the title of the press.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the track for designer Marta Yakubovsky while using the product.
Hundreds of children have been moved to a temporary camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has increased considerably, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the sharp rhetoric and policies the Trump administration has introduced to make it harder to accommodate children with sponsors.
As usual, sponsors were mostly illegal immigrants without documents and fear that they would threaten their own possibility of staying in the country if they went out and searched for a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households had to deliver their fingerprints, as well as that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Police, confirmed last week in front of Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsorship of minors with no effort.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of people who were sponsors or members of the sponsor’s household are illegal in the country, and most of them are criminally prosecuted foreigners.
That’s why we’re still chasing these people,” Mr. Albens said.
According to the refugee workers, in order to process children faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a month of detention, rather than within 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Most will use a conference video instead of a personal presence to submit a request for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are found not to meet the conditions for release will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain in detention, the higher the likelihood of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to workers at the shelter and reports from the system during previous months.
Deputies say that concerns about this have been raised in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is being tortured can be easily overlooked due to size.
They add that moving children to a temporary settlement without leaving them enough time to emotionally prepare or forgive a friend can cause trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, France and Turkey 'occupied forces' to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mu'alem also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in their country has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil, on the grounds of fighting terrorism, and that they would be “acting accordingly.”
“They have to withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he said before the assembly.
Mu'alem stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions have left their homeland.
He also said Damascus would continue to “run its world battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “the entire illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground by the war of a devastated country.
In connection with the refugee issue, Mualem said there were satisfactory conditions for them to return and accused "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that refugees remain out of the country.
“We have directed an invitation to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with their return,” he said.
“A real policy from something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a vacuum zone in the last major insurgency in Idlib led to the creation of opportunities for further development of political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish deal has diverted attention from attacks by large-scale Syrian forces that enjoy Russia’s support in the region where three million people live.
Mu'alem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the aim of military action would be jihadists along with the Nusra-linked Al Qaeda-linked fighters.
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition will resemble the aim of drawing up a post-war constitution that would allow Syria to hold elections.
Mu'alem expressed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to reviewing articles of the current constitution," and warned of interference.
Why will Trump win second term?
According to that logic, Trump could get re-election in 2020 unless, as a large number of liberals likely hope, accusations and scandals end his reign before that.
In something that would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic last episode of presidential career in history!”
There are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Viewability in terms of impact has more than doubled since 2014, reaching 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled with 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million in terms of hitting, which is more than 1.7 million than they had four years ago, according to Nilsen, while Show Rachel Meadow network MSNBC ranked first on cable TV with the most viewers in the world.
“It’s the essence in which people are drawn because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neil Barr, the lead producer of the ABC series, “The Dutymaker,” who talks about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the destruction of the Capitol in the attack.
Neal Scowell, an experienced comedy writer and author of The Only Fun Parts: And A Few Painful Truths About Hollywood Behind the Scenes, has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked him why.
Ms. Scowell says that she replied, “Because she’s laughing at me.”
Chaos also contains the value of entertainment.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, plots coming from Washington can determine the future of women’s rights to an abortion decision, whether immigrant families will be able to unite and the state of the global economy.
Excluding the program is a luxury that only the most acclaimed spectators can afford.
Yet, a little outweighs the status of an informed citizen by a more informative post when you capture yourself as you have been watching a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward in his book "Fear" places information as facts," adding that "a pilot's jacket from the back of the skin is like a 5,000-year-old."
As for me, I'll never look at Super Mary the same way again.

An influx of foreign money in the middle of a race for early presidential elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania Congressional District is getting inflows of money, thanks to the restructuring of the Congressional Districts, which led to two deputies fighting for the same seat.
So recently fell Conor Lamb, a representative of the Democrat of the suburban district of Pittsburgh, who took a place in the second district in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is in a race with another deputy, Republican Kit Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had unconstitutionally matched the results of the election in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th launched a competition to fund campaigns between the party's largest funders, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
For Lamba in Pennsylvania, it was heard after a close victory in the widespread March special elections for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
It has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the election for 20 points.
Politicians have given Trump a good advantage.
The U.S. considers to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, so it withdraws
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump held a heartfelt meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and owned a hotel in Panama until his partners moved to the Trump organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to revoke U.S. diplomatic mission representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” said Heather North, a spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs.
However, the penalties only apply to El Salvador, which in 2017 received US aid in an estimated <0x24>140 million, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
Phrased penalties, which include cutting off financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hardly fall on a Central American state that already has a high rate of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings continued, North and Central America officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic progress to pursue a similar meeting last year that they considered a step forward in efforts to migrate.
But by mid-September, the administration’s top officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and put a spot on all questions about the penalization of El Salvador.
It was announced that Vice President Mike Pence would be attending the conference, whose new term is mid-October, indicating the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, according to diplomats.
And so three U.S. embassies quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new sharp messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal issues on condition that they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, also anonymously.
Study the history.
The next inevitable thing is likely to be a report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, of which there is already significant evidence in public sources.
Mueller is also allegedly launching an investigation into whether Trump’s campaign has been in contact with Russia in connection with the election attacks.
If the administration of Congress were to go to other hands, Trump would face responsibility in that body, as he is preparing to come out again before voters, and possibly before a colleague’s court.
That’s a lot of unconfirmed possibilities, and I don’t want to say that Trump’s defeat is inevitable – as well as the defeat of his counterparts in Europe.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make decisions that will determine how long the difficulties will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler, that the West was able to resist and dissuade Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We did not succeed in that, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the execution that followed the following years.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are now faced with several such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who manages the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an undisclosed grape after the newspaper announced last year that he had suggested the president to secretly record and commented on his inadequacy for the function.
Rosenstein says the Times statement is inaccurate.
“How do we react when the newly launched investigation by Bret Kavanaugh in the FBI is neither complete nor fair, or if it gets approval from the Supreme Court, despite reliable allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the early elections for a Congress that Trump considers reliable?
If we fall on these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light a Sabbath candle on that swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorans of Rangers optimistic before meeting Rapid Wine
Rangers welcome Rapid Wien on Thursday, aware that their victory over the Austrians, after an impressive equal score with Vilarreal in Spain earlier this month, brought a firm position for the qualifications of Group G League Europe.
Graham Doran, a midfielder, could not appear in the season due to a knee injury until a 2-2 draw with Vilarreal, but he believes the Rangers can take advantage of that result as a jumping board for bigger goals.
“It’s a good point for us because Vilarreal is in a better position,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something, and we went out with the guy.
We might have been able to get them in the end, but considering everything, the same result is quite fair.
They were probably better than us in the first half, but we went back in the second and behaved.
Thursday is approaching and it will be another big night for Europe.
We hope we can get three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a great score from the last game. Although, with the audience on our side, I'm sure we can catch up and get a positive score.
The past year has been very difficult, with everything that has happened to me with injuries and changes in the club itself, but the current position is satisfactory.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy, the training is good.
We hope that we can get back on track now, leave the last season behind and achieve success.”
Women Are Worried About Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants clearly knew what kind of care they wanted to receive, very few of them talked about it with families.
About half of those surveyed in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them said they talked to their children about it.
“People want someone in the family to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to discuss it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t familiarize them with your desires enough in advance.
Together with the counselor and the family, decide where and how you want to get care because these are the choices that smartly affect the cost.
Include a financial advisor: he can help you find a way to cover those costs.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include the usual permanent care insurance policies, a hybrid life insurance policy that involves money and value to cover costs or self-insurance from your own property, as long as you have a new one.
Organize your legal documentation: warn litigation.
Get a health care assistant to have a reliable person who you can trust to take care of your health care and that health care professionals are familiar with your wishes in case you are unable to express yourself.
Also, consider granting the authority to manage your finances.
You should choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions instead of you and take care that the bills are paid on time if you are not able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your aged parent comes into a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to give answers to questions about medications and allergies?
Export these details in writing so that you are ready.
“There are not only finances in the game, but questions like who are doctors?” asks Martina.
“Which medications do you use?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have a plan for all of this.”
Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times with an air rifle as he returned home from the exit.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Ilfracombe area of Devon under the name Oxford Grove, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and cheek.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. in British Summer Time, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries were not life-threatening, and the police directed the witnesses to call.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people lost their lives in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to increase, according to official sources.
Due to broken ties, emergency relief officials were unable to obtain information from the Dongal regency, an area north of Palu that was closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the crash.
Here are the most important facts about Palu and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi:
Pula is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 from 2017.
The city at the time of the earthquake and tsunami was in the middle of the celebration of the 40th anniversary.
Dongal is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region of lower provincial level, had an estimated half-life of 299,200 people in 2017.
The economy of the province of North Sulawesi relies largely on fishing and livestock, especially in the coastal region of Dongale.
Excavation of nickel is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in the Moravali area, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulevasi.
Palu and Dongal have experienced more tsunami strikes in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In the 1938 Dongal tsunami, more than 200 people lost their lives and thousands of homes were destroyed.
Tsunami again hit West Dongal in 1996 when it killed nine people.
Indonesia lies on the seismic fire belt of the Pacific and is a regular target of the earthquake.
These are the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The Great Earthquake that hit the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of its population.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people have lost their lives on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Zaparna Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters in which dozens of villages were destroyed and about 300 lives lost.
2016: A lesser-depth earthquake hit the Pidjaya regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the destruction caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people lost their lives in demolished buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake has destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily homeless.
Sarah Paylin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trek Pailin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Pailin, is arrested on charges of harassment.
According to a report released by Alaska State Truppers on Saturday, the twenty-ninth-year-old Pailin from Basile, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as allegations of domestic violence and detention.
According to a police report, when a friend tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Pailin was detained in Mats and was given a <0x24>500 bail, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, stating that he was “certainly not guilty” when asked, the network reports.
Pailin faces three A-Class offences, which means he could receive a one-year jail term and a <0x24>250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which is punishable by a day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time a criminal case has been filed against Paillin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pailin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently on trial for Alaska veterans.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the reporting of a crime and possession of alcoholic weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had hit her in the face with a song.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by veterans in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSP) that had arisen due to the war in Iraq.
Tsunami caused by earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on Friday on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
A 7.5-degree earthquake has caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been disrupted, and the number of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit only central Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
On social networks, videos are circulating that show the moment of the hit.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment not executed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to attack the cycling trail along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October and cut down pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" committed serious bodily injuries, according to an announcement of the intention to seek the death penalty filed in New York's southern district.
According to the court document, both points carry a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury raised 22 prosecutors against Saipo, which included eight counts of murder with retaliation, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and prosecutions and assault charges.
The attack required "substantial planning and prejudice," the prosecutors said, describing the way in which Saipov carried it out as "hurt, cruel and corrupt."
"Sifulo Habibulaevic Saipov has caused injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Laurent-Dikat, Derena Draika, Ariel Erliyi, Hernana Ferruccia, Hernández Dálega, and Hernández Dálega."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since New York's southern district last prosecuted the death penalty.
The accused, Calid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who originated in Uzbekistan, did not repent in the days and months after the attack.
Police said he told investigators he was feeling good about what he had done.
The prosecutor said Saipov told the authorities that he was encouraged to carry out ISIS videos on the phone.
Police said he was also searching for the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He said he was not guilty of the 22-point indictment.
David Petton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting the confession of guilt with a life sentence without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” he said.
Saip’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative Party Member of Parliament Says Najgel Farage Should Be Responsible for Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage today, during a protest at a Conservative Party conference, promised to “mobilize the People’s Army.”
Former UKIP leader said politicians should face Euroscepticism – as one member of parliament Theresa May suggested, he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backwards envoy Peter Boone told the Birmingham summit that the UK had “already come out” that Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
However, the challenge Mrs. May faces in reconciling her divided ranks is emphasized by the attitudes of the Conservatives who are for the rest and join a separate city protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to follow the Chequers compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, the rest supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist on continuing efforts to reach a deal with Brussels despite the reaction – and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its offer and the “chaos”.
Mr. Boone said at the Leave Means Leave summit in Solihaal that he wanted to “reject the Chequers.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should become equal and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If I were responsible, we'd be out by now," he said.
A member of parliament from Velinborough added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we have to reject the Chequers.”
Emphasizing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Boone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely wrong.”
Andrea Jenkins, a Conservative Party deputy and Brexit supporter, also attended the protest and told reporters: “I’m simply saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for him, it is not popular with our party and with our activists who actually go out to the streets and put us first.
Let go of the Chequers and start listening."
In a message to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their place when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the assembly that politicians must face problems if they decide to hand over the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us – people – and our political classes,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we won’t let them get out of it.’”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on its way to betray Brexit, to feel the coming plague.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that won the victory in Brexit and we will not be calm until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the remains strolled through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A large number of activists mocked the “Conservatives vs. Brexit” banners after the group launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, the leader of the Labour Party, has been arguing with the Conservatives over the security issues they had with the party's application since the conference was opened.
“It’s the people who tell us they can set up IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus solution, for a border-free, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.”
Good Brexit, that doesn’t exist,” he added.
Vorenova plans to consider more entry into the presidential race
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider the entry into the presidential race” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future in a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Jeff Dyle, a Republican representative, who was co-chairing Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that Warren could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Hollywood was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall since Trump took office.
Some participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that “it’s time for women to go to Washington to recover the upset government, and that implies a woman at the top.”
Arrested suspect who shot Sims, an LSU player
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, said on Saturday that the suspect who shot and killed LSU basketball player Wade Sims was arrested.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, at 11:00 ET at the conference.
They posted a video of the shootings on Friday and sought help in identifying the man seen on the video.
Sims, 20, was killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayd Sims was shot in the head and passed away at the same time," Murphy J. Paul, the head of police, told reporters on the 247sports channel.
Wade stood in the defense of his friend and Simpson shot him.
The Simpsons were interrogated and he admitted that he was present, that he owned a weapon, and that he killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and brought to the police department of eastern Baton Rouge.
A 198.12 cm high junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games with 10 starts in the last season and an average time of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 leaps per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton wins World Champion title after losing his team victory over Sebastian Fetel
From the moment Walter Bottas qualified ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team would play a major role in this race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called on Fetel to attack his colleague.
Fetel first went to the boxing and left Hamilton to get into the crowd at the end of the tape, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes ran later and went out in front of Fetell, but Hamilton ran after riding the wheel with the wheel, leaving Ferrari's driver inadvertently in danger of retreating after a dual defensive move on the third shift.
Max Ferstappen moved out of the back row and reached seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race to reach a fast finish and took Kimia Raikkonen fourth place.
He went to boxing in the 44th round, but could not increase speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen remained fourth.
This is a tough day because Valtery was driving brilliantly the whole weekend and as a real gentleman he missed me.
The team did a great job by winning the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was a bad body language.
President Donald Trump joked Senator Dayne Feynstein at a rally on Saturday over her claim that she had not released a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate, Breta Kavanaugh, of failing to file a lawsuit.
Speaking at a gathering in West Virginia, the president did not directly deal with Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people are "bad, disrespectful and dishonest."
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that’s happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, evil, disrespectful and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at the announcements and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Dan Fynstein, did you let that go in public?
Remember her response... did you leave the document in public – “Oh, please, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we announce it to us...No, we didn’t,” he added, talking about the senator.
Fynstein received a letter from Ford in July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the letter leaked to the public in September. Fynstein rejected the claim that the information leaked from her office.
"I have not concealed the allegations of Dr. Ford, I have not published her story," Fynstein told the committee.
“She bothered me to keep the story confidential and I kept it as confidential as she wanted it to be.”
But her rejection seems to have disliked the president who commented during the rally on Saturday night: “You know what, it was a very bad body speech.
“Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court’s candidate, who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president said Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They decided to return power by any means.
"You see evil, ugliness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to surpass to get power and control," Mediaite said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars paid off their loss to the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants with a 5-3 rematch on Saturday.
The Giants took advantage of the two goals scored by Patrick Dyer and Francis Bowley.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took advantage of the home field before Dwayer regained the leadership of the Giants.
Francoa Bushar equated for Dundee before Lukas Landvod Nilsen's two goals secured the win.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Kif, who came to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwayne's opener reached 3:35 assist with Kendal McFall in the fourth minute, with David Rutherford providing the assist after Bowley doubled the lead four minutes later.
At the time of the busy opening, Salivan returned the advantage of the game at home at 13:10 before Matt Markoa assisted in equating by the Union at 15:16.
Dwyer secured leadership in the first third when he scored a second strike at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar scored a great goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran helped Nilsen to provide the Dundee team with leadership for the first time in the match at the end of the second half and ensured their team's victory in the fifth part of the final half.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five matches, will play their next match at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Rescue Hundreds of People on Airplane from Earthquake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after allowing the plane with hundreds of passengers to fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many disappeared after a major earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong strikes continue to shake this area and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite the evacuation of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his job in the control tower that collapsed at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the city of Palu.
He remained to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at the time, had flown safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he saw the tower fall.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sire, said the decision Antonis made may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts are broken because of this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, as the National Disaster Management Agency said access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Butong was restricted.
"The number of casualties is believed to continue to increase as many bodies are still under wreckage, while many cannot be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nagroho.
Waves that reached up to six meters have destroyed the Palla, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial airplanes bring aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says to Sky News: “Emergency brings body at every moment.
There's no clean water.
Mini-markets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfend, director of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is struggling to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidododo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the state military: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the rescue.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lamboc, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one person has disappeared after the plane crashes into the lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia said one person had disappeared after it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the flying aircraft.
Air Niugini said it had been unable to find a passenger, a man, since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find passengers.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger such as age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed while attempting to land at the airport on Chuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained in a hospital on Saturday, and all are in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the fall and the exact order of events.
The airline and the navy said the plane had landed in a lagoon near the track.
Some witnesses think the plane missed the track.
American traveler Bill Janes said the plane was flying low.
“That’s an extremely good thing,” Janes said.
Janes said he and others managed to break through the water to the waistline to the emergency exit on the plane that was sinking.
He said the stewards were panicking and screaming and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby on port repairs also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to the coast before the plane sank about 30 meters underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in the crashes of airliners registered with PNG over the past two decades, but none of them were Air Niugini.
Analyst shows chronology of the night when a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor’s office on Saturday ended his exposure at a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulette testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He cited for the trial how he used cell phone records to combine the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Roulette said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contrary to his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with a cell phone belonging to Mr. Chambers during a period of time when he said he was with his friend Michael Senford, police went to talk to Senford.
Senford came to testify on Saturday and said he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Senford truck that night, Senford said he was "lying because the truck was in Neshville."
Another discrepancy is that Telis said he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
The cell phone records show that they only knew each other for seven days.
Roulette said that some time after Chambers' death, Telis deleted her messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to deliver the final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to continue during that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop that raises awareness?
The hip hop trio wants to change the negative image of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has gone away from its roots – political messages and social issues.
He wants to return to the roots and restore the popularity of social-political hip hop.
Performers such as Fujiz and Comon have become up-to-date in the UK again thanks to performers such as Akala and Louki.
Is there another black person?
Daddies in New York City sued couple for firing after “racist” message
A New York midwife has sued a couple for discrimination and dismissal after they mistakenly received a text message from their mother in which the mother complained that the midwife was "another black person".
The couple denies that they are racist and identifies the suit with "extortion".
Lensy Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEES ONLY ONE BLACK PERSON,” Mrs. Plasko-Flaxman wrote to her wife in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
When she realized the mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "disturbed" and dismissed Mrs. Morris, stating that their current nurse, who is an African-American, was not doing a good job and that she was expecting the Philippines instead.
Mrs. Morris was paid one day of work, and then Uber was called to take her home.
Morris is now suing the couple for a compensation for the dismissal and is seeking a compensation of <0x24>350 per day for the six-month job he was originally supposed to do living in their home, though without a contract.
“I want to show them that they can’t do things like that,” she told the Post magazine on Friday, adding, “I know it’s about discrimination.”
The couple rejected claims that they were racist and said that dismissing Morris’ employment was a reasonable move because they were afraid they would not be able to have confidence in her after she was insulted.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t plan to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists." Joel Plasco's husband told the Post magazine.
“But why would you give your children to someone you have been rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, please.”
Identifying the lawsuit with "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and that she was in "a very difficult situation".
“You’re going to find someone in that state?
That’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly dismissed the couple on social networks and condemned them for their behavior and logic.
In a recently revealed letter, we learn that the publishers of the book about Paddington were afraid that the readers would not tie up for a bear telling a story.
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It’s very fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before being inspired by a little teddy bear to write this children’s book, would be optimistic even if his work was rejected by the time of the year and added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release was a “short-spirit”.
For Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she said her father was discreetly proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a quiet man and he wasn’t proud,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it felt like people had a child who had achieved something: they were proud of him even though they didn’t actually do anything.
I think that's what Paddington's success looked like.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed all his merits to Paddington himself.”
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“Ned called regularly to say that the condition was very bad, that he didn’t expect to survive,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperus said.
“I got a late call from Ned telling me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The action of the drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart beat slowly stopped and the drugs left her system.
She died a while before, and this was actually a shutdown of the entire system.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to stick to it.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, sadly for the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who did not know what hell she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I shook my head and tears swelled across my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer I felt immense sympathy for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women sadly set up cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support on one Welsh bridge.
The son of Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidnya, said her son was a cook with great potential and a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him with a smile.
They always said that his smile was lighting up the room.”
However, he resigned from his job before his death because “everything was dark for him.”
After taking his own life in 2014, he was found by his 11-year-old brother.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there will be some consequences."
Mrs. Davis made the cards “to make people aware that there are people you can contact and you can talk to, even if a friend is in question.
“Don’t worry, you need to talk to someone.”
Mrs. Humfries, who was a friend of Mrs. Davis for years, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was sad or depressed or something like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He touched the bottom on Christmas day – when the children opened the gifts, he didn’t look them in the eyes or anything.
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to come to an end with it: “It leads to a breakup in the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brit Cavano's future hangs on end as FBI launches investigation
“I thought that if we really get something similar to what he was asking for — an investigation with limited time and limited scope — maybe we could come up with some slogan,” Fleck said on Saturday, adding he was afraid that the commission would “disappear.”
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their opposition was due to the timing of the event.
Since the midterm elections are only five weeks apart, they are held on November 6th – if Republicans go badly as expected, they will be significantly weakened in attempts to bring the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush constantly calls on Senators and lobbyists to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI publishes its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republican representatives and 49 Democratic Party representatives.
It is still uncertain whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mother Pens, the vice president, to break the decision and send it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of deserters ‘fall’ under Kim’s rule
The number of North Korean deserters who fled to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, Park Bjong-seg said there were 1,127 runs last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter controls on the borders between North Korea and China and higher prices for people smuggling were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most have crossed over China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross due to the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as illegal migrants, not as refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are technically still at war – have improved visibly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks about postponing negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after a June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ree Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally be the first to disarm," Mr. Ry said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Breta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says she is unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and stated that his temperament makes him unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribunal Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t give the impression that if a woman ever behaved that way, she would be called hysterical,” Pelosi said in connection with her reaction to Kavanaugh’s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when he was a teenager.
During the introductory exhibition, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he almost screamed and his throat tightened as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling the charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated attack on the personality" organized by liberals angry over the loss of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it was noted that he had prejudices against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated to provide an answer when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to court if he was accepted to the Supreme Court and if Democrats would gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll tell you this – if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he doesn’t have to be in the Supreme Court, but in the court he is currently in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential judgments against the Accessible Health Care Act or the Row vs. Wade Act because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the subsequent hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say how wonderful it is,” Pelosi said.
And women should be proud of it.
It’s a justified criticism, months and years of flooding with anger and she can’t throw it out of herself without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s a rare occurrence, do I?”
She continued, “To a large extent, I was helped by a woman who was the CEO of a company and who said she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when I was angry and started crying, the person she was talking to would talk to.
I'm angry."
And then I'd just keep going.
It sounded great to me, too.”
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger in part because people basically don’t understand them.
One of my strongest memories was when I was at one previous job in an office where mostly men were crying out of indescribable anger at one time and when an older woman caught me for a neck – a cold manager who I always got – I was a little bit shy.
“Never let them see you crying,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they hit you like that.”
Patricia Schröder, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gerry Hart during his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital love affair on a ship called "The Monkey Job", and when he fell out of the race, deeply frustrated Ms. Schröder realized that there was no reason she herself did not try to get into the race.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "The Snowman and the Seven Spiders."
Since the campaign had already collapsed, she lacked funds, so she swore she would not enter the race if she failed to raise <0x24>2 million.
The battle was condemned to destruction.
She found that some of her supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to men gave her only <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she gave a speech in which she said she was not going to start the official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration for the system that made it so hard to raise money for the target voters – instead of getting the voters, and getting the delegates.
“Someone would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schröder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
“A man would think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd put on my graveyard?
“She cried?”
How a trade war between the U.S. and China can be good for Beijing
The initial strikes in the trade war between the United States and China were staggering and although the battle is not even near the end, the gap between the countries may be suitable for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning hit earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week was the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) effectively taxing half the total goods arriving in the United States from China.
Beijing has repaid the same measure every time, and the last time by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on <0x24>60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to return the United States to the same measure and does not appear to be the second-largest economy in the world to change its position soon.
In order for Washington to retreat, it must bow to its demands, and public acceptance of the terms of the United States would be too much of a shame for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could in the long run positively impact China by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that making a quick decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for the start of an economic conflict in any of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher at the U.S. Navy.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help in the restoration of a country devastated by the war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mu'alem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation in the country is more stable and safe thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists in order to re-establish normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mu'alem said the regime in Syria would be happy to accept aid in the restoration of the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that financially supported the uprising.
Europe Relations Another Victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European type won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a victory over the United States team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National pitch in Paris, France.
The U.S. has suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained victory by winning the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn 14.5 points that he needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who had been tortured during most of the tournament, threw the ball with a tie in the water on a par-3 hit at the 16th hole, giving the match to the French Molinary.
Italian golfer Molinari has been sparkling in all rounds, becoming one of four players who have ever won 5-0-0 since starting the current form of the tournament in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit is superseded by 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world’s best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, was defeated with 2 and 1 by Ian Polter from England, who may have been the last rider’s cup.
Veteran who played in eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio García became the European with the highest victory in tournaments with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stand it today.
This was a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I’m so glad we won the cup again.
"The team is the most important thing and I'm happy to be able to help," Garcia said after winning Europe.
He tracked down his countryman, John Ramu, who won the American golf legend, Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
I feel an incredible pride that I have won Tiger Woods, I have grown up watching him,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four matches he played in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 points in his Ryder Cup career.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 great titles, which surpassed only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team has been struggling to make good moves throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaw, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furick commented on his team's disappointing game: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we almost reached Europe.
We've been trying.
Every part of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, cooperate with the PGA of America and our Raider Cup Committee and continue.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to worship.
We're overweight."
