Barack Obama is the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
U.S. President Barack Obama arrives in Oslo for 26 hours to be the fourth U.S. president in history to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
A <0x24>1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded, among other things, for outstanding efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be on guard.
He is first invited to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with five members of the committee, which selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple then has a scheduled meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremonial ceremony to which Obama will take over the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth president of the United States, but only the third to win the award directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when he receives the award.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
The military effort a few days ago was further enhanced by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to emphasize any of its critics.
At the Obama ceremony, he will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for 10 million Swedish kronor (about 24 million Czech kronor).
He's going to give it to charity, but he hasn't decided on a specific charity yet.
The president’s busy program will then be introduced to a banquet where, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, he will also be the prime minister and 250 other invited guests.
From the beginning, Obama was rather reluctant to pay the price.
He said, for example, that he feels he doesn’t deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not just about the price for him, but for all who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said that it was a "call to action" for him.
Nature Protector Accused of Extortion
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the president of the civil association of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Nature Conservation Society of extortion.
In several cases in the past year, he appealed to some construction proceedings, for withdrawing the appeal he asked investors for money for his benefit, said Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
Lubomír Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka is the chairman of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ica Society of Conservators of Nature.
He is now in custody and is facing up to three years in prison.
Sorting containers Brno does not smell much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort their packages from drinks, in the South Moravian villages you will encounter sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There to reserve for a few minutes before you find the right ash.
I don’t want to say that there is no waste in Brno at all.
But it seems to me that the fact that we are the second largest city in the republic, the councils are not interested enough about this problem.
Brno is in the forest lizard of sorting waste not only by the fact that as citizens we can still throw only paper, glass and plastic into sorting containers, but above all by the number of garbage bins for such waste.
For example, have you ever tried to throw a PET bottle into a collecting basket in the center?
It's a ready-made compost, especially it takes time and firm nerves.
The only place I have encountered so far is in the Moravian square opposite Potrefené Huse.
Don't let Mr. Underka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't think that's a good thing.
Not to mention that there is no honey in other parts of the waste sorting.
A lot of my friends prefer not to sort the waste.
From the lens.
They have it far from the ashes.
I'm not surprised by them.
After the celebration, I offered myself to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored ash in the sight of Kounica Street.
Fortunately, I got to the right place on the road to the shell.
However, the waste has gone over it.
It’s still the center of Brno, which probably represents the city the most, isn’t it?!
But ecology and some aesthetics probably of the Brno socialists are not very interested.
They would rather buy the city a hockey extract that would embarrass us all over the republic than they would buy a couple of containers in addition and offer a sorting of other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I am glad that after a while of browsing the internet I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is the worst in the South Moravia region.
"Paroubk<0xC5><0xAF>v" budget took money for pensions and sickening
After the left added despite the government’s views to farmers or officials, there may not be money on pensions, sickness or construction savings in the budget.
But also on interest on public debt or on international litigation.
This will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, Finance Minister Eduard Janota said.
When social democrats and communists promoted the rise of certain groups, they relied on the government to borrow additionally from sensitive expenditures, pensions or sickness. "It's just a delay in the future, putting mines," says Janota.
In fact, the borrowed money is being paid more and more interest and sometimes it has to be returned.
There is no power to choose where to take it, the state has no power.
If they do not reduce the social benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To all that the left has now added: to firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later on, their children.
Pensions or illnesses, from which 1.8 billion have disappeared, people don’t have to worry about getting them.
But at the cost of becoming more indebted – next year there will be no shortage of only 163 billion in the cash register, but more.
Despite my efforts, Minister Janoty’s debt grows faster and with him the cost of interest increases.
The state will need money to pay it, and it will no longer be enough to inadvertently increase VAT or reduce maternal taxes, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the money transfers in favour of several groups of voters, five billion will also be missing next year for the construction of highways and railways.
These are mainly already competing and arranged sections that cannot be redesigned and possibly discounted.
Preservation at the highest level, which is also not free.
This means a delay or a halt to thirty large buildings, there is also a risk of pumping European money, said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has proposed that the loss of money will solve Shalamounsky – reach the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which the state mostly owns, and from them contributes to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is no longer a futile source at all.
Last year, CZZ raised 18 billion to the budget.
The dividends are paid annually for the elimination of environmental damages, supplemented by a pension account or served as a reserve for the pension reform.
In addition, according to EU rules, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 per cent of GDP.
However, the carnival does not end.
Almost <0x24>3 billion was spent on various compensations for victims of communism and crimes, or on spending on litigation, even building savings.
If you can do it without that money, it's not certain.
It's the lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we will have to pay the same amount, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, at worst, reach the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing for the already unveiled two-billion-dollar Treasury project, which is intended to allow online monitoring what individual authorities are spending on.
The first phase will start in January.
If the finance minister could not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions would come, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will be able to handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone on which a user will switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The unveiled plans sound promising.
Simply press one key and you can transfer from Windows Mobile to Android in a matter of seconds.
This is precisely the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We allow you to keep two user profiles on your mobile at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and was presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems to journalists.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, which was run alongside the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones, and the devices are expected to reach customers in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains is troubling the hoteliers
The bare slopes don't only worry about mountaineers.
The lack of snow also distracts people from booking ski stays in hotels and pensions.
For this reason, there are still available rooms in the hills for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
People are browsing offers, looking at prices, but so far they are afraid to order bindingly.
And if they're calling us, they're asking right away if we think Christmas will be in the snow or in the mud this year," said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to stay in Spindler's Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n for Christmas exactly according to your ideas, you should no longer hesitate to order.
If you prefer to save money and the quality of the accommodation is only in second place, he may still try to wait a few days.
So far, Spindler's hoteliers are offering only weekly stays for the New Year.
I think they'll try to give it up for a while, but then they'll allow it and go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will fall quickly," Jandura said.
Free beds in all winter periods are still offered by the top-class travel agency Ingtours.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not sold yet.
Almost half of the seats in our offer remain vacant.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper last minute holidays,” said Peter Schiefert, director of Ingtours.
Silvester in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC4><0x87> can also be offered by the top-level travel agency, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fourteen days of February are well on sale, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the hills.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, the rooms of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sne<0xC5><0xBE>ka are a bit better than last year.
We're about five percent better at that.
We have the last few places on New Year’s Eve and Christmas.
There is a great interest in the Polish holidays in January and it is also well-selling in February," Karel Rada, director of the best hotel, said.
Of the eighty percent, the Omnia Hotel is also occupied by the central parking lot in Janské Lázník.
On the contrary, at Christmas, half of the beds are available in the newest Gymnasium hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, which we already have occupied about 60 percent at this time.
It is a bit weaker so far in February, but as soon as the snow strikes, the interest in staying in the hills will certainly still rise, said Omnia Hotel Director Erik Sporysch.
However, on the greater part of the snow, the hoteliers of Krkonos have yet to let the taste go away.
On Thursday it is supposed to cool, if there are any precipitation, so there should be snow in the mountains.
But then the warming is to come again, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the castle workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute reported.
USA: Repeat is the Mother of Wisdom
It is comical how Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself deemed the stupidest.
When he finally welded his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out to be a copy of Bush’s Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only did he use the wording "as in Iraq" several times in the text, but he did not even hesitate to use the name of Bush's January 2007 statement as the name of his own statement: "A new way forward".
He himself criticized Bush’s idea three years ago of sending fresh military reinforcements to Iraq stricken by the civil war as “irresponsible and in its consequences a disastrous decision.”
However, the following months have shown that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of the field commanders, was the only possible and successful one, so that it is not discussed today in the news conferences about Iraq at all.
Bush did not improve his reputation, but objectively left his successor with a much more grateful initial situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
It was once again requested by field commanders, in particular Commander-in-Chief of Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite subordinational habits, harshly criticized heavy gunmen in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president has been hesitant for three months, but he hasn't done anything better, so at least he has detained the general by 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to take the promise of another 5,000 from Europe, even though he had originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic of all Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to start the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and end this process in three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than provides answers.
Many doubt that the half-increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the brother-in-law wars of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreement.
The situation in Afghanistan is characterized by the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are adhered to.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are preparing badly to change their master every day according to their suitability.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain only a Potemkin village, for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balance of interests of different ethnic groups is unusually complex given the opacity of relations that further complicate the influences of Pakistan and Iran.
Even the construction of an "access state", which is the minimalistic goal of the whole operation, does not seem too realistic.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is shattered by his volunteerism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that the soldiers sent to the war cry for the purpose of "brown return home" will cause the miracle done here, can only the soul truly romantic, untouched by the reality.
Politically, the date of the withdrawal of the troops is clearly irresponsible, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect recognition of the American defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is negligible.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war in the Indian submarine.
Another factor capable of radically intervening in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iran do not work, there will be an overwhelming question before the United States whether they are not trying to solve the problem by military force.
It will need to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will move on to a winning withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will also mean a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left in the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time left to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total loser.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer receive cash rewards
U.S. Goldman Sachs executives will not receive cash rewards this year.
This was announced by the company, which is responding to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will get the share money, which will be able to sell first in five years.
In addition, shares can be withdrawn from managers if they take an excessive risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of combining rewards on Wall Street with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after giving away nearly <0x24>17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) in rewards in the first three quarters of this year.
The company’s total salary this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed <0x24>20 billion despite the measure announced today.
With the advent of the financial crisis, high wages in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in many countries.
Britain on Wednesday announced that it intends bankers' bonuses exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (around <0xC2><0xA3>712,000) to charge 50 percent of the tax at a single time.
Similar steps are being taken by France.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all disciplines except physics.
Today in Stockholm, a record five women took over this year’s Nobel Prize in professional categories and literature from the hands of King Charles XVI of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists among them was the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their nationalist Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize in medicine for their research on chromosomes.
The chemistry award was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonathan, along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for explaining the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last laureate was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, won by the American Elinor Ostromov and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for economic governance analysis.
The only professional category that went unattended this year was physics.
This award was awarded today by scientists Charles Kao for research in fiber optic and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each awardee has received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of winning the financial award.
The amount for each category reaches 10 million Swedish kroner (approximately CZK 25 million).
If there are more rewards in each of them, they share the reward with each other.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was won this afternoon by President Barack Obama in Oslo, Norway.
He acknowledged the controversy of his appreciation in his speech because it is only at the beginning of his career and is also at the forefront of a country leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defending his policy, however, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to fight for peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janot is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will welcome Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janot, who is considering staying in the government because he disagrees with the state budget for next year as approved by the House on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps even Janoto's stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
He said the deficit is too high, which further deepens the public finance crisis.
The meeting was reported by the President's spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to talk to Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday about his next tenure.
According to the budget law, which Klaus will now have to sign, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
However, the House on Wednesday approved proposals by the left to move money and increased the money for salaries of state employees, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has outlined the proposals of social democracy that they are secretly raising the budget deficit.
This led to a sharp internal political dispute between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, on the one hand, which started to raise a question about the further work of Fischer’s official cabinet, and the formation of which was carried out on the other side.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, is essentially eliminating a package of austerity measures that was implemented by the Fischer government in the fall and which, according to it, is to stop the debt of the state.
Klaus, who can, but does not have to, sign the state budget bill, said at today’s breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected a “serious problem” that is “unsustainable deficit” in public finances.
He says he no longer has a good solution.
Improvements could only be brought about by a strong government, which could also be based on a broader consensus of political parties, the president said.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is scary and the government should consider further existence.
Deputy President of ODS Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and Greens is no longer apparently working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as "strong statements".
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD chief Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek responded to the words that the budget deficit that the former government of Topolánk prepared for this year, which exceeds 200 billion kroner, is frightening.
Already on Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD marked the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The people were satisfied as well.
Mandela played Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's Newspaper
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Unconquered tells the world a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories despite some criticism that the main roles are played by American actors.
The story tells about sports, races, and Nelson Mandela.
The invincible warrior against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first Black President Nelson Mandela in his life story is Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, aged ninety-one, asked him if he could make it in Eastwood's film.
Matt Damon also plays a major role in the film.
I said to him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The 70-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood's drama from the boxing environment Million Dollar Baby, has already formed the leader of the abolition of slavery movement, which eventually became a slave, a fictitious president of the United States, and even as many, and even as many, of God's gods.
The former South African statesman was sentenced to 27 years in prison for his active work for ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became the country’s president for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is the Latin word for undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who belong worldwide among the outsiders.
The South African team will eventually be relegated to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story on the canvas.
“I had no other goal but to play this role so as to bring it as close to reality as possible,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be in the backseat before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandel's hand.
I found that when I print your hand, I take over your energy, it is transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you were feeling, he said.
It’s important to me to try to be a different person.
Matt Damon is portrayed in the film by François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which white players prevailed.
The player said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A big surprise to him at the end was when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I ringed the home bell, he opened it to me, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their real designs under the direction of Eastwood, Invictus: An Unconquered Positive Reviews and the Oscar ambitions are also discussed.
The film critic of the Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his rating in words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of the rays over Norway unraveled: Russians tested a rocket
It was possible to observe a special lighting effect of unknown origin over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only admitted yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian borders.
The start, however, was again unsuccessful and the missile, dubbed the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the bulwark of the Russian army, is slowly becoming the black dungeon of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence in missile tests did not have an appropriate effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the bladder did not explode or was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers it is already written about "Bulava" as a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly but lights
This was the 13th attempt at the beginning of the series.
At the end of the flight, technical damage to the aircraft occurred again.
Apparently the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time "Bulava" started from the Dmitry Donsky atomic submarine, which was floating below the level of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows shooting from a ship that is in motion and at the same time submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by a nearer unspecified flying object was actually violated "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not doubt from the very beginning that it was a Russian missile.
The generals are defending themselves this time and claiming that failure cannot be said unambiguously.
The first two stages of the missile survived and the accident hit the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were broken immediately in the first degree.
Although not a single test start has been completely error-free, only six out of thirteen are considered unsuccessful by the Department of Defense.
Almost fifty percent of the success therefore fills the generals with optimism and so still claims that the "Bulava" will once fly without problems and that it even seizes up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed a 51-year-old contract at CSKA Moscow
The legendary defender Vja<0xC4><0x8D>eslav Fetisov will again be presented in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
Former world champion, Olympic winner and holder of the Stanley Cup will help out his team CSKA Moscow and will appear to be in the KHL duel against Saint Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulja<0xC5><0xA1> got hurt, we need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We just need to deal with some formal issues, the agency AP coach of Moscow club Sergei N<0xC4><0x9B>m<0xC4><0x8D>inov quoted.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of other players, he said.
According to AP, Fetisov will become the oldest Russian professional hockey player in the event of his return to ice.
In the NHL, he played the entire season for Hartford legendary striker Gordie Howe and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic golds, seven World Champion titles, won the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he was also successful in the NHL, where he doubled the Stanley Cup in his Detroit shirt.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai meets trade unions. Cancels all overtime
The management of Hyundai carriage company agreed with the trade unions to cancel all overtime.
Due to the often-ordered overtime, trade unions declared a strike alert on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on another Saturday exchange this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, which is essential, so it was proposed a voluntary overtime on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts being made, Vanek said.
Server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz wrote that the company of employees working on Saturday exchange offered a bonus of CZK 400.
People will get it back to work on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Va<0xC5><0x88>ka, the company has decided to change the way employees are motivated in the proposed overtime.
Either they pay an extra fee for overtime or they can choose a replacement leave on December 28, and thus extend the holidays by a day, Vanek said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive paid rides and lunches.
Since the overtime was the most pressing and inflammatory point in terms of the comments and complaints of the trade unionists, and the protesting employees, who vehemently stopped production last week, the management of the mines yesterday afternoon decided to overtime, with immediate effect.
Automotive workers were forced to work a two-hour overtime almost every day after the eight-hour shift until last week.
After the signing of the agreement, the trade unions withdraw the urgency of the strike
The next meeting between the management of the automotive industry and the trade unions will take place on Friday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike readiness.
The situation in the car worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to continuous overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and alleged harassment.
The management argued that overtime should be done by employees in order to meet the requirements for car delivery.
In their Monday strike preparedness statement, the unions also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on employees who discontinued production on Wednesday.
In the field of overtime, trade unions demand the company to minimize overtime work.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5,000 crowns this year.
The Hyundai No<0xC5><0xA1>ovi<0xC4><0x87> company now employs 2,000 people.
The company began production in November last year.
By September of this year, it produced approximately 80,000 cars, with its current production capacity of 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also takes on the 'stupid' HIV virus
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow down the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the enhanced substance is that it also takes on viruses that have already acquired anti-immune drugs.
This fact, in some cases, prevails over the fact that the compound on the common variant of the virus does not act as strongly as some drugs already available.
The AIDS disease is not cured yet.
However, patients can significantly prolong their life by mixing medications that prevent HIV from multiplying in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus multiplication also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which the drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, from ALL Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance to the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarbonates act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new ‘enhanced’ compounds prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the virus's life cycle.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV fragmentation, mature infectious virus particles would not have arisen.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the researchers explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
A bit weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti-HIV protease drugs has been tested in tuberculosis and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications from both metallocarborans make interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective drugs against HIV.
The ODS went to Fischer, he's defending himself.
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek described the approved budget for next year as "horrible" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider further existence.
The statement of the ODS was marked by strong statements by the Prime Minister.
They say they have time for analysis.
Deputy President of ODS Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party is apparently no longer working.
According to Necza, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to stand in the House on a minority that is about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is about staying in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>z warned.
The House on Wednesday adopted the budget for 2010, however with left-wing amendments worth more than 12 billion kroner.
The House increased the money for salaries of state employees, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s motto for the Social Democracy proposals was that they secretly raise the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, meeting the government’s wishes that even the revised budget is a less bad option than the budget provisional.
Disappointment and vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will further assess the current situation.
Once upon a time, he is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to step down from office in the event of the adoption of amendments, the situation could look different.
According to Czech television, Janota ordered for the prime minister on Monday after the government.
He added that he was considering continuing to remain in office.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer is on his way to a further fight against the budget deficit, according to Netime in the government, there is nothing to do about the CSSD nominees that have implemented the budget changes.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves additional laws that increase deficits, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or the new employment law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not intervene
It's a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
Ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the US.
He recalled that in several ministries, there are people in the office of deputy who report to the TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Recica stressed that if Fischer decides to renounce the principle of combating a higher deficit in public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct to rely on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
Then he said he could not count on the support and tolerance of the civil democrats.
I didn’t think about it, and when it’s up to date, so I’ll do it,” Martin Barták told reporters in the House of Representatives, who had just been nominated by the civic democrats for the government.
This afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for the European Council.
At the request of the Prime Minister, ODS resigned
Recently, at the same time, he stressed that ODS would probably vote against the revised budget on Wednesday if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask the MEPs to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, then he responded to the question whether the ODS did not burden the absence of the party president in the parliament and the Czech Republic in the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
As soon as I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the following months it would be primarily about the bolshevism of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new <0xC4><0x8C>D order, fewer trains will go for almost the same ride
The Czech routes will cancel or limit some less heavy-duty gears and locomotives from 13 December, while other connections will strengthen.
The total range of transport will be reduced by 2% from the date of the new schedule, compared to today.
Most of the fares, including the basic and the customer ticket, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of Ostravska have more options to connect to the capital, and the routes to this route add one set of pendulums.
The highway will stop driving to Bratislava.
There are no direct trains departing from Prague - Písek to <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, but there are no direct trains departing from Prague to Letohrad.
Of the regions, the routes are planned for the largest reduction in traffic in the Králové-Hradec region, a total of 8%, on the other hand, Prague and the surrounding area can enjoy the increase.
There are also two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice and the operation of several high-speed trains on the route Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice is limited to only a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today Milovi<0xC4><0x8D>ti must transfer in Lys nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the suburban Esko system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the route from Lysè nad Labem to Milovic.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the destination station of Prague Main Station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will launch more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperka/Jeseník will run at two-hour intervals.
Passengers are no longer connected by Pendoline to Bratislava from 13 December.
This year's Regional Railway Account: 200 million more
The Ministry of Transport orders and pays the acceleration, in total to compensate for the so-called demonstrable losses will give the dear next year four billion crowns, as well as this year. The locals order the counties, in total they will pay the following year eight billion crowns, with fewer states in thirds.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The tracks have a new ten-year contract for the locals and the highways, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The drivers praised the system, and apparently did not try to increase the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only take place for the one-day network tickets of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka online tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 SEK to 600 SEK.
The price of the eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will again vary from the distance, so far it has been uniform for the journey between any regional cities and was 160 kroner.
Filipino Armed Forces Detain Over 50 People, Kids Released
Armed forces in southern the Philippines have kidnapped 75 people, including several primary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 kidnapped.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 gunmen are said to be using hostages as a live shield when escaping from police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the extradition of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police initially pursued the kidnapper for violence that required the settlement of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the recent massacre, which killed 57 people, declared a permanent right.
Thirty journalists were among the victims of the November 23 massacre in connection with the elections to the governor’s office.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, a patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The JAR story is about everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood Invictus (official title in Czech is Invictus: Invictus), which captures part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of a world-famous warrior against apartheid was played by Morgan Freeman, who was said to have chosen Mandela for his debut years ago.
The male side role of legendary South African rugby champion Françoise Pienaar was matched by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the picture in the cinemas emerge from the opinions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the South African Union.
In 1988, he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993, he received the de Klerk Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
high expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when in South Africa the summit of preparations for the world football championship, but at the same time the media is shaking alarming reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination among the population of the Czech Republic.
According to the AP news agency, comments on the new film in JAR have so far been universally positive, despite numerous reservations over the occupancy of the main roles by "sweet" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have been well prepared for it.
I also met with Nelson Mandela many times in person to, as they say, drain his energy, he said in an interview after the film’s premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandela's personality and message in the movie.
This is the story of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the national rugby team
The film is based on a book by British author John Carlin, titled In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave birth to the nation portrays a South African human rights advocate during his first presidential election.
During the film, Morgan Freeman tries to stigmatize two races and, after many years of mutually defined population groups and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays an actor in the South African national rugby shirt at the World Cup.
For entering the lawn in a suit, which is understood in JAR almost as sacred, Mandela harvested a large ovation of the predominantly white audience fourteen years ago and gained recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reunite people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in JAR will improve will only be shown.
However, white South Africans are skeptical of what rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain, revealed in a recent interview with the LN.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
A transformer burns tens of millions of crowns in Lousca
In the morning, a transformer of the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps caught fire in a district in the village of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsk.
According to Lukash Marvan, a spokesman for regional firefighters, six units are involved in the fire.
The firefighters originally wanted to let the transformer burn, but later re-evaluated the opinion and the fire burns a mixture of water, foams and special abrasives.
The reason was the technical failure, the internal shortening of the transformer.
No one was injured, the accident, according to company spokesman Pavly Mandatová, does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated to be several tens of millions of crowns, it will only be possible to accurately count it after the end of the fire.
According to the Mandate, the destroyed transformer will be replaced by a new one.
In ten years of operation of <0xC4><0x8C>eps nothing similar happened, the flaws of this type are unique, she added.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>EZ spokesman for northern Czech Republic Soni Holinger Hendrych’s electricity supply was not interrupted, the operation of households, authorities or companies of the fire station was not affected.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps operates in the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the transmission system, electrical lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
Maintains, restores and develops 39 circuits with 67 transformers that transfer electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system and a 4,339-kilometre line.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura filed a criminal notice for blasphemy on three hejtmans from <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, today filed a criminal notice for blasphemy against three social-democratic prisoners.
On Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka from the South Moravian region, Radko Martínk from the Pardubice region and the hajtman of the Olomouc region Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99>ík.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura stated it in Twenty Minutes of the Radio Journal.
The complaint relates to the company’s efforts to operate regional train transport in some regions.
In the end, however, all regions signed long-term contracts with the Czech Drama.
All three hajjtmans are attacking us and talking about picking the grapes, while we only offer what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know Czech Railways prices, which were closed last week.
So we just have to defend ourselves.
It's for slander against the Student Agency, he told the Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura Radio Journal.
At the same time, he said that he has evidence from all countries that they have not taken their steps in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers the submission of a criminal notice to be a further continuation of Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as an unpaid advertisement for him by his company and his own people.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of my and my region, and to the same challenge and other heroes.
I suppose that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who is manipulating the public in the matter of regional rail transport and using false and false arguments, Hashek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that he is investing several million kroner in advertising that will alert the regions of the unfavorable move.
He told the radio magazine that the campaign would be interrupted after Christmas and that he wanted to continue in it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will be directed against corruption as such.
The campaign started in Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura after the regions agreed to operate regional rail connections with the Czech Drama, and about 150 billion crowns were not tendered.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar actions are illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has already threatened to criticise train traffic in the regions.
The only threat was that if we didn't leave it, we could lose a bus license.
He introduced himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know who the gentleman is, I will not say his name, he told the Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura Radio Journal today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and mandatory
Vaccination against pneumococci since January will accumulate habits.
It should be the first for families free and at the same time optional.
However, there are already voices that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination peaks.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already sets the maximum prices of vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are already clearly in the vaccination process.
New Vaccination
Free Vaccines for Children of August
Since January, children born on 2 August and later can be vaccinated against pneumococcus free of charge.
The condition is that not a single dose of vaccination has been given yet.
Anyone who started vaccinating last year or earlier will have to pay for another vaccination.
The first dose of vaccination should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of age of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families volunteered to vaccinate their children against pneumococcus.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner for one dose and more.
Four doses are needed when vaccinating the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450,000 kroner per year on vaccination doses.
However, it saves on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has given about 500,000 children a year for all surface vaccinations.
The game was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain skin and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections in our country will kill up to 28 children under the age of 10 in a year, according to a hospital survey.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they introduced paid surface vaccination of children against pneumococcus in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccination may be mandatory in the future.
From January it will be paid by insurance companies and optional.
For example, the head of the civil association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> suggested that mandatory vaccination would be better.
His association of pneumococcal vaccines has been promoting for a long time.
The experts at the international conference, which our associations attended, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that at least this has been implemented.
“I think that’s the way we have to go now,” Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At this moment we do not think about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>en.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Professional Society of Practical Pediatricians, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered to reduce the number of over-vaccines "For a situation where these vaccines cost such a high amount, we understand fairly the political decision that the vaccination was initiated as voluntary," says Cabrem.
Experts expect their babies to be vaccinated against pneumococcus by more than 80 percent of fresh parents next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough in that it is paid by health insurance firms, not the state, as the first surface vaccination of children.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, thus saving on further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy the drugs themselves.
However, this is related to the concerns of practical pediatricians regarding the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, the vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies and doctors would receive them in a similar way as the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some MEPs feared that in this way insurance companies could "draft money from health insurance."
Doctors will therefore have to buy the drugs and wait until they are paid by the insurance company.
It is estimated that individual practical pediatricians will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist 'stealed in a museum'
The son of renowned American creator Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal <0x24>20 million (<0xC2><0xA3>12 million) of paintings from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was landed while loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
Named Mr. Frazetta and the other man used the Poconco Mountains bagr to infiltrate the museum.
Mr. Frazetta senior, aged 81, celebrated the creation of the characters Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time when this happened, the artist was in Florida, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Mr. Frazetta Jr. could have been motivated by long-standing family disputes.
Frazett, a 52-year-old, made a sworn statement before the police that he had done so at his father’s direction, “to get to the museum in any way possible and move the paintings to the desserts,” the agency said.
Mr Frazetta senior denied any such authorisation, the agency said.
Labourers are preventing planned tax increases
The ministers defended the increase in taxes and cuts in spending announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, Tory's "waste" the opportunity to show that he is serious about postponing the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
Even the chancellor got under fire because of the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, it is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social security and 1% in the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Discernment with respect to social insurance
Trade unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they did not invite and warned in advance of "problems".
Social security is on the rise – an increase of about <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion a year – which upset the business community, which said it was an employment tax, while there should be a focus on restoring the economy.
This increase, which is limited to these revenues above <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, affects approximately 10 million workers.
KEY BODY PBR
Social security will increase by an additional 0.5% from April 2011
Economic situation worsens more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New tax 50% of bankers' bonuses
Increase of 1% corporate tax on depreciation in small companies
Reduction of taxes for electric cars and wind turbines
Increased pension measurements by 2.5 %
According to the state financial administration estimates, some <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 revenue will decrease by <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and some <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 revenue will decrease by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while some <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 revenue will increase by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers announced that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 means "complex decision-making", but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should fall to 5% of people with the highest income.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending limits would be "a drop in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers, which will allow us to halve the deficit, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms said he is convinced that the economy should grow at the turn of the year.
But the development of forecasts for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of loans needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the chancellor was forced to revise the previous amounts.
In his opinion, he said the economic decline this year was 4.75% - far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - because loans were <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
"Wasted Opportunity"
The Conservatives, who launched a new campaign on Thursday to warn of a “debt crisis” among the Labour, said the planned loan of <0xC2><0xA3>789 trillion over the next six years was unbearable.
The ministers failed to submit a credible plan as to how it could be paid, adding, "cynically" to postpone this decision until after the election - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be feasible," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they missed it."
“All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourers insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the proposals of the Torys, who would like to reduce the deficit more quickly and on a larger scale.
But liberal Democrats argue that the money earned by increasing taxes and reducing spending should be used to support spending next year rather than reducing the deficit, and argue that the plans are "built on the sand".
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said on the timing of the announcement - for example, the above inflation will rise and there will be an inability to pay taxes next April - that this could lead to charges to the chancellor in the election campaign if the money was to be earned.
But Labour insists on providing special assistance if people will need it very much and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
The Suspicious Budget
Although the ministers did not disclose details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that a reduction in public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term constraints.
The Recognized Institute of Budget Studies said that the Chancellor’s figures indicate significant cuts in many areas, potentially in construction, including transport, higher education and defence.
"It's really very painful so far," said its director Robert Chote.
“All important statements will only come after the election if we win them,” said Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s financial advisor to account audit.
"This was a report about a suspicious preliminary budget. Markets are implementing it."
FBI Investigates U.S. Prisons in Pakistan
The FBI is conducting an investigation in a prison in Pakistan of five Americans suspected of being linked to extremists.
The men were arrested for attacking a house in Sargoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the BBC reported to the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was an investigation into whether they were the same men who were detained in the last month at their home in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of State said it was also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them are said to be from Pakistan, one of which has Egyptian ancestry and the other is from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were detained," Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schwait said the agency was informed of the arrest and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are really missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washgington said the men were detained in a house belonging to the uncles of one of them.
It said that the house was always at the centre of the local police interest and that no charges had been filed against the detainees.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, Reuters said, but said the United States had to “cooperate much closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan in disguising the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The disappearance of the five students from their home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Refusal of amnesty for Iranians.
The human rights situation in Iran is just as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, according to the Amnesty International mission report.
The report describes in detail the "methods of torture" in the regime before and after the controversial presidential election in June.
One of the men said he was bit and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above-mentioned criticism of the report on respect for human rights.
Officials have labeled this criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested in Iran and dozens have been killed following the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of them were imprisoned and prosecutors sentenced the last five people to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran John Leyne, who is now in London, said earlier in the protests that the supreme leader Ajatolah Ali Chomejní had declared illegitimate some forms of torture and banned their execution at the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of legal power has been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
False Confessions"
Amnesty International quoted a 26-year-old computing student named Ibrahim Metahari as saying he was accused of "working with Facebook" and protesting against the election results.
"They were often in my face," he said in a statement.
"They smoked me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened me with execution and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the protests and tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iran’s top government officials denied allegations of rape, but admitted that torture was taking place.
Amnesty also reported the case of a former prisoner, who said he had been held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty International acknowledged that Iran's parliament and justice had set up committees to investigate electoral unrest and government reactions, but said the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees were unpublished.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn the Bristol memorial into a successful track for the race.
The race track at the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping bridge before a 100 m long slope.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a stunning view from the top of the slope, but it was really stunning.
It was a wonderful view of the flashing lights of the city downstairs.
“There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country – some of them real talent,” he added.
The awards were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the runway.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
They're still us
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on minarets and alarming reports of alleged Islamization of Europe are generally spreading, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate more into society - and whether the cultures could integrate - into the world.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became admirers of the authors of the last work, "Why French people don't like headscarves" (2006), this elegant and debated study of the controversial issues they divide and employ the country.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a wider and much more ambitious shot.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, now taking care of 5 <0xC3><0xB7> 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic premises".
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students on the issues that most worry him.
Should a Muslim enter the marriage union in a mosque or in the town hall (or in both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
These are the seemingly worldly controversial issues that are being discussed and that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas employed by the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others well-known people, excluding Tarik Ramadan, Arab, a Muslim researcher and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a discussion about how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen at the same time in a modern secular society.
They don't have arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen interviewed tend to claim that this group is small, but it is influencing European Muslims, as opposed to Selafi—the supporters of the Sunni Islam purist, united in Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
The question arises as to how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite, who have thus contrived to defend the secular public) are truly devoted to the idea of pluralism.
It is the view that Muslims probably have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism, he discovered the "screwing of value screws".
After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say "Yes, but not now."
The world’s most desperate outlooks
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet’s environment.
Limiting ice hides at alarming speeds, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be focused on new natural water resources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when awakening them.
In the book "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, mimics the natural history of the iconic North, the polar bear.
Well-acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whale hunting describes a long tradition of polar explorers who tried to capture the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson with a brave 14-year-old swimmer who fought only with a mosque stick is truly a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears, who were swimming for the bodies of their mothers who had just been killed, were captured and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared in a circus tent.
Even today, zoo fences typically have a million times smaller area than the area available to adult individuals in the wild. Climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter and Indians are hunted on skis and all are armed with powerful attack towels to shoot their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in the waters of the north of these two hunting nations and the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "After Ice", Alun Anderson, former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and inconvenient responsibility for science for the Arctic and an intriguing light look at how the future can change it.
Scientists don’t have answers for everything.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have adequate response to the rate of change.
That's for lack of tests.
Fridtjof Nansen's exploration journeys at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries for the first time indicated how floating ice is being moved.
The submarines during the Cold War then mapped the floating sections as they submerged them.
Satellite exploration and a wide field of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still carried out thanks to the undamaged individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks at the extremely fragile world of the falling system inside the Arctic ice, created by the squeezing of salt water that shrinks when it freezes.
But from the above-mentioned bear to microscopic wonders, all this is condemned to disappear as summer ice moves, which sometimes takes place between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, it could be us.
6,000 Marine Corps Members Put a Widow on Arlington Tombs
Officer De'Angelo Robinson, 19, travelled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who took a trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate the tombs, it was the day they gave up the hold to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
“In a few months when we’re on board, it could be us,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me, so that they show respect for me as I try to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the veterans’ cemetery in several departments at the Arlington Sunday event.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Cemetery Company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the Arlington Cemetery.
Now it’s an 18-year-old tradition where Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen make this journey every year and stop in different cities along the way to honor the memorials of members of the army and victims of terrorism.
Worcesters are not looking for a profit in this, they are swarming across America, which they put in other countries as well.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths at the Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the memorial site of Flight 93 United Airlines in the state of Pennsville.
Already in the second year, the Walmart Foundation has dedicated more than <0x24>150,000 to buying and transporting gifts.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made her way to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way back to what the victim is doing.
This is a small way that citizens can support our units, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
The volunteers walked through the cemetery in the surrounding lawns and hills, covered in warm cloths.
Volunteers targeted the older graves of World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War because they are not visited as often as newer graves.
The mood was positive when the children played and held their hands together as they transported the young pineapple to the funerary stones.
Each round beetle was dark green with a small red arch at the top of the bird.
Near <0xC2><0xA7> 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was indeed silent.
Associated service organizations devoted 1,000 wreaths to decorating the department, but the cloudy mood of the wars that were just going on filled this area.
Some sincerely cried, others prayed, and family and friends held each other in the cold air.
Some read the names sharply, carved into the stones, while others leaned to look at the small black and white diamonds, pressed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from their eyes in front of her son’s grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the last resting place of artillery sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. . . .my son paid for it, the rules.
"Even though I've been away a long time, I want to be the one who will remember him."
U.S. government supplier imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, foreign ministry officials said on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, sought access to the detainee who was detained on December 5.
Some allegations have not been made public, but according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is labeled "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs. Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country so she can take over the prizes, but her permission has been denied.
The detention of the U.S. supplier may be a result of growing tensions between the communist brother Castro ruling in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seen as a "sustaining tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report a New York Times arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a public worker is <0x24>15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost more than a daily wage.
The use of the internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and at some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to apply frequently must notify their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Detention of Americans in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in Cuba's prison are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, Gloria Berben, a press office at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the prison.
Detention and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's say free mobile phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. human rights group's program, which recently published an unfavorable report on human rights, such as "the old-fashioned news of freedom in Razrao, Razrao, and "the old-fashioned in Castzano."
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, convicted and imprisoned in one day.
He said that any solution would be rather political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as these two countries are heading for a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are disclosing conspiracies about sending men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered the alleged leader of a conspiracy involving sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. units there, and said they hoped that the case could be discredited by young people and help the Internet spread.
Investigators said they were looking for a grey insurgent known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one of them posted a comment, approving the terrorist attacks on my YouTube video page.
Saifillah took over the leadership of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan in the range of the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who filed the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in persuading al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA’s attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were deployed for several days to the eastern part of Sarghada, far from the frightening mountains in the northwest, which became a refuge for terrorists.
They were considered to be a strike unit.
The reason they were detained was stated by an official who spoke about maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not frightened and were still trying to get permission to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were detained under Pakistani law.
The case of this five, which remained in Pakistan and was interrogated by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, identifying who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence service has given the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, excluding those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be instigators.
U.S. fake recruits were undergoing a special investigation at al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become considerably more cautious in recent years in allowing them to join because U.S. intelligence agencies have gained experts on their recruitment methods.
If we try to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been so closely followed?
This model is one of those that is far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, calling for climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets on Saturday, calling for more climate action from negotiators in the city’s Bella congress centre.
Protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police estimate the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists laid a few small charges near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day when a small incident took place in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city and wore posters with English inscriptions "This is not Planet B" (i.e., second-class) and one in Spanish, which reported "The Earth is raining."
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helen Christensen, who said she had traveled to her mother’s homeland in Peru and provided me with information about the uncomfortable state of the country that is affected by climate change, which is still undergoing.
That's part of the reason why we decided to join this great march -- to go around the world and appeal to the world's leaders to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding agreement," she said.
It’s not an easy task, but it needs to be done, it can’t be avoided all the time.
Police prevented protesters from approaching Bella's centre and said they had detained 19 people, primarily because they had masks or pocket knives on their hands.
These activities are prohibited by Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating viewers, who does not want to be identified because he is involved in climate protests, activists masked as athletes and in black clothes laid several charges near the main Copenhagen channel, which is located near several ministers.
They acted at the buildings, he said, starting with lights, but then followed "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not come to the attention of key officials, such as Su Wei, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (in fact, it is something I am not aware of).
Then he went on in Chinese and said, "Because the scenery is vast, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He monitored whether the walk was painful or helpful depending on everyone’s outlook.
It is seen the concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words, “It can also be said that it is a violation of the actions or freedoms of others.
Test Data Reveals Continuous Persistent Racial Differences
Last week’s federal certification of mathematical knowledge was a welcome element of good news about public education in the District of Columbia.
Although the district is far behind the country’s high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress in fourth and eighth graders over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest figures of the National Center for Educational Progress attestations are the persistent differences in knowledge achieved between African Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth grade students in Columbia County in the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from a possible 500), but their African-American peers have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the difference in knowledge achieved increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress in African Americans in eighth grade remains essentially steady, with a statistically insignificant deviation of one point from 245 to 245.
The average score in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture on the six-year horizon is not very encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth-class students in 2003, when NAEP was first conducted in the district, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the score achieved in children of both groups improved during this period, the difference hardly approached 58.
Some district education advocates said in the past week that the results celebrated by secretary Michelle A. Rhee and mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were more widely stimulated in white students where high scores were already.
This would indicate that we have increased the sum of support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying," said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, the nonprofit group that advocates for equal viewing in the district.
“I don’t jump up and down because of two or three points distraction,” said D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), a board member who has a daughter in Eaton’s fourth grade elementary school.
Often criticizing Mrs. Rhee's administration style, Ms. Brown said that reporting on the test results means high school in the city is in a state of despair and requires attention.
It's obvious that you always want to see bets, and I respect that.
But what’s scary is that we didn’t devote almost any time and energy that we needed to devote to our high school.
Mrs. Rhee said that the district's endeavour is to continue to look for better ways to address the needs of students with low results.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new reading basics, Wilson's reading system, aimed at students of primary school classes and high school students who were unable to master the basics of reading earlier in their secondary careers.
The daily mathematics and basics of mathematics teaching in the sixth grade, emphasizing games and real-life experiences that got into the district for former director Clifford Janey, can be attributed to the tip of the NAEP progress that has been misrepresented.
And that's what I think we should continue to work and do the best we can with those students who remain below class levels, said Rhee.
Others said that NAEP’s findings clarified the question of whether Ms. Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain preserved dilemma of Mrs. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of teaching at the University of California at Berkeley, where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The conventional remedy procedure is to focus funds and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can bring political invocations that are directed against an important agenda.
But the challenge, of course, also belongs to other city directors who are trying to maintain a medium proportion between whites and blacks.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We must strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can trust that their children will be provided with excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the director of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that the key element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is an extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, in order to achieve eligibility for schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to make changes, said Mr. Janey, who signed a contract with his association of teachers last year for a school year of 185 days, which he calls a “sign” to look for greater increases next year.
Making Higher Education Part of a Better Future
The tour bus entered the Gettysburg Railway with loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, performed and for a moment rested on white columns, brick facades and emerald green grasses.
Gracieli's parents had difficulty graduating from college in El Salvador.
Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the college grounds.
Now she and other eighth grade students in the group explored Gettysburg, where the tuition was <0x24>38,690 a year, their position was rather than intimidating visitors to enthusiasm potential students.
Yes! That's it! called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Oh, really? the rules were deliberate when they were told by a low proportion of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of seven people who visited on their three-day tour and were now completely concerned with the future message: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is where it comes from.
However, this is a bearish problem regarding the high number of children born to Spanish immigrants in the United States who are excluded from high school or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive further education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one-fifth of this "second generation" of Spanish students from college - remarkable achievements indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and residents of Central America, entered the United States without graduating from high school.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, as it underscores their point forward for a generation that has played a marginal role in the field of the country’s labour force.
Those who have attained higher education say that they had a natural tendency to go to school and an innate perseverence and effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and were looking for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to graduate from college — especially if these efforts persist in time.
If we take into account the fact that children come from low-income groups whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them get disoriented in the system, any simple intervention at every single point will not solve it, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, University of Davis.
We need to think about providing these children with a catch-up network in preschool in all the ways they can go through college.
The federal program that financed Graciely’s rail trips is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than <0x24>300 million a year for local school systems to launch follow-up preparatory programs, starting for low-income high school groups and continuing until these students finish college.
Since 1999, this program has served more than 10 million students, of which more than 1% have entered college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's Ministry of Petroleum Industry reaches agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to force significant oil companies to rebuild their unsustainable infrastructure during two auctions on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Industry with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in the restoration of Iraqi oil industry, protected by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies have just moved to two out of 10 fields with a share of capital.
Seven U.S. companies paid for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one of them made a lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached an agreement on the field that was auctioned in June.
The massive involvement of U.S. oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and the place of American companies here is in the first place on the road to Asia and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
It will be a long time before something else is on sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by mass coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military, are likely to distract U.S. companies from much more intensive business in Iraq, which has proven to be the third-largest crude reserve.
U.S. firms have been disadvantaged in some cases, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have significantly lower operating costs and are more risky because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into agreements with the ministry.
Leading U.S. firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Industry and offered technical assistance in recent years, have left with empty hands.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has participated in bids for more contracts than all other companies and has gone off with large stakes in contracts in two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become a major economic, as well as a technological force, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, Assam Jihad.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and will be able to meet its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected to submit bids, which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level in each field.
Al-Qaeda's top planner was killed in Pakistan.
The attack on the U.S. missile at the Pakistan-Afghan border this week is believed to have killed the top al-Qaeda planner, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets hit their car near the city of Miran <0xC5><0x9A>ah in the province of North Vaziristan, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities said the rockets were fired from an unmanned aircraft operated by the CIA in the band of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were pointed at a white car heading to the Afghan border when it was hit, the official said, along with a Pakistani civic intelligence agency calling from Miran Shah.
The official said the local armed forces had reached the point and quickly seized what remained of "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited an unspecified witness who said Somalia had been killed.
Somalia has been cited as a high-ranking planner of al-Qaeda military operations, which has led terrorist groups operations outside the region of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He has been involved in global harvesting, a senior official who does not want to be appointed, said, citing the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes in Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the top Al-Qaeda leadership and was planning possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another U.S. official said Somalia was rapidly acting in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn’t have to be a well-known person for some Americans, but he didn’t humiliate himself in any way to stand in front of us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban to be killed since September, when Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the indigenous tribes band, and three other top operatives were killed in a similar attack.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has decreased from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to the Long War diary, a website run by the nonprofit group.
The reduction may be justified in the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also mercilessly killing people suspected of being informants, the site said.
The United Nations High Delegation to Kabul has resigned.
The United Nations top delegate to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he wanted to step down from his post in March and end the stormy term, which was stifled by accusations of widespread corruption in the US-backed presidential election in Afghanistan.
Eide's departure is due to the Obama administration's decision to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. delegate said he was in favour of the increase, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable to reduce the situation, which begins in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the build-up of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans to have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian personnel assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign, but that he simply kept the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would need time to find compensation.
“As I said, it’s time to look at the successor,” Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to U.N. officials, Ban began seeking compensation.
Officials said he was deciding between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian descent and previously headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, France, who previously led the UN peacekeeping operation.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested by his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election for masking the presence of massive election machinations.
Eide denied the allegations, but said that Galgraith's accusations -- which had been released -- "surely damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism regarding international interference" in the election.
Eide said he had proposed a meeting with the highest representative of the citizens to coordinate alleviation efforts at US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow its successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, so he said he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money is needed.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations of his efforts in Afghanistan, saying that the UN’s tough hiring regulation undermines its ability to use its capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I have had the opportunity to get only one person since May, he said.
It's a disaster and I can't continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers would soon impose "other significant sanctions" on Iran due to lack of involvement in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week’s journey through war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, undermined the prospects of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
"This is not a good choice for Iran," he said in response to a military question about likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is an irresistible unpredictability in war.
Obama’s administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could affect Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iran.
He said a "pack of incentives and prohibitions" would require "to make the Iranian government feel less secure with nuclear weapons" because "its residents will suffer extremely" by sanctions.
According to the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leaders in warning that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme into full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its nuclear energy agency, the Inter-Atomic Surveillance Authority.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on restricting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his stockpiles of enriched uranium in exchange for the urgently necessary fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration has established itself for such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two sides and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran has deviated from the interim agreements – partly because, the expert says, because the Iranian leadership is divided in opinions about whether to engage with the United States.
Honestly, as far as Iran's toughness towards the international community is concerned, in the case of some proposals that he actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think this has brought the international community, including the Russians, the Russians and the Chinese, to the terminology of the non-Chinese people.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals on December 31 before returning to look for other elections, including monitoring, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “degrading sanctions.”
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unsubstantiated and unsubstantiated accusations" before some members of the security committee about Iran's next nuclear strikes and said it wanted to continue the talks and talks with the states.
Gates, who returned to Washington on Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish leaders in Irbil.
It continues to have high tensions between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly because of borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce potential for conflict to prevent delaying U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish concerns about the ongoing depression, a US official quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzaani, the president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters on which they read that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to have more children" and "One more child means one more grave".
Then they learned that when official government sites in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth rates and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and started encouraging young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to one child.
We didn’t leave anything for the second,” says Wang, 31, a human resource manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China’s more than 30-year-old policy of having only one child has been put in place, creating two generations of only notoriously bullied and bullied children, affected by the so-called “little emperors,” threatening the country’s population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six before policy went into effect, according to UN data.
Population distribution, where the population aged 60 and above is projected to grow stormy from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in the rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and above accounted for almost 22 percent of the registered population in Shanghai, while the fertility rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said many couples must have children to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and reduce the number of workers in the future.”
He says it's about "being old, it doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual calming
As it was incorporated into the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate ever established under the Communist Party government.
Couples who violated politics faced huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China’s official sites have been advocating a policy that has helped the country to prevent critical sequestration of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned in advocating the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women with their second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist selection losses, leading to an unnaturally high male-to-female ratio.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually milder in their views on the politics of one child.
In 2004, exceptions were generally allowed - including urban residents, members of national minorities, and cases where a man and a woman were single - and in 2007 they softened the spelling of their passwords, advancing the hardline.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University Institute of Population Research, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of their partners was a single child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters, urging parents to have only one child, were replaced by copies of the regulation, describing in detail how it would be allowed to have another child and how to apply for permission.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and put the flyers under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who have chosen to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
A sad response.
Although officials in a rural city in the vicinity of Shanghai saw an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign began, most city districts did not report any changes.
Huinan city district with a population of 115,000, for example, still recorded four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, chairman of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu district, said financial considerations were probably the main reason people don’t want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and they were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, who only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a docile capture network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the policy of one child as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in a bond with her first child in the seventh month of pregnancy.
Yes, we were spoiled for the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the Human Resources Manager, says they only want one child because she was the only one too: "We were the focus of our families and all took care of us.
We weren’t used to providing care and in fact we didn’t want to care for others.
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old translator, expressed this much more discreetly.
For two-year-old middle-class parents who have reduced birth rate, he said being successful means being selfish.
Today’s 20- and 30-year-olds look at their parents as if they were going through the first days of their experiment with capitalism and don’t want to live this way for themselves, she says.
It’s just one child that puts huge demands on parents’ time, he says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there's still the controversial space questions -- "You need to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You need to have a resume prepared when the baby is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to be happy with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN Group has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching unprecedented stances and reciprocal bleaching -- once again on Friday focused on releasing a document that proposes an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years.
The text, which can provide a basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But there was significant progress in negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Established by the UN ad hoc working group, this text unnoticed how much money rich countries should give to the poor to deal with global warming both in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of elections for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies in order to limit their carbon output and what should be the upper limit of global temperature rise that political actors will still be able to tolerate.
This delivers a great deal of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, the top representative of the Sierra Washington club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, shortened the 180-page text from the talks to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
It sets out slopes for a possible agreement in which industrialized nations could jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union quickly discussed Friday's promise to provide <0x24>3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adopt adaptation to climate change -- from flood management and drought to deforestation prevention.
However, the same type of verbal firefighters, which prevailed in talks last week, were still mentioned on Friday.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Affairs, Todd Stern, declined a speech calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reductions for industrialized countries compared to volunteering in major developing economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The move signaled that the Obama administration had set a tougher line against China than Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not enter the agreement without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, Stern said, who also delayed that the text is not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei told the U.S. top climate negotiator that either lack of "social reason" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" led to a lack of "social irresponsibility" in order not to become financially, financially, financially, economically, in a week.
With the future of the economic trajectory of the major world powers at stake, typhoons have emerged both within the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and the developing economies.
The current struggle is mostly about preserving the individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States on the fulfillment of their respective commitments, while the poorest nations point out that the two dozen most influential countries in the world are ignoring the impeachment of science.
Ricardo Ulate, the delegate of Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of reducing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large-scale emission of greenhouse gases.
It is a clear game that new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional advisor on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature conservation.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change have indicated that they would like to continue enforcing a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the key stakeholders have said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Small Island States Alliance, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page deal on Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate talks in favour of the European Commission, said the enactment by small island nations "caused political pressure on the entire political process" partly because they are now united and demand action from growing economies.
The talks gave rise to a new urgency as soon as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining controversial issues before the heads of government struggled to reach an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, have stepped out of the aircraft and walked through the halls of Bella Center to closed doors and new conferences so that they can identify claims that will be punished.
The total extent of the gathering -- when 13,000 people were moving daily from and to the congress center, the guitar-playing activists staged at night ironizing views of the countries they thought they were sending them -- and a sneak peek was made to pass the ballots.
Intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen, and earlier on Wednesday, 60 heads of state were present.
We got into the top categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said Deputy Minister for Global Policy at the International Conservation of Nature.
Heavy weights are coming.
Britain's first train at 140 miles per hour pre-empted this feeling on Monday.
At 5:13 p.m. on Monday morning, the elevator cut the darkness on the sign of the departure of the train, which meant the transport revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country reaches 140 miles per hour and flows from Ashford in Kent to London’s St Pancras and crosses the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and joined the first high-speed personal kit outside London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect large agglomerations of Midland, the North and Scotland to London.
The notified standing water should reduce transport times in passenger and on commercial roads, and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road traffic congestion.
Theoretically, three main political parties were allowed to gain this vision.
But the dozens of trillion pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable struggle for projects and concerns about environmental disturbances have now slowed down the construction of British high-speed rail lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasible study, passed its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
She provided him with a detailed map of the route of the next planned high-speed network stage.
A new route connecting London to West Midlands has been proposed within five meters in urban areas and neighborhoods where reaching the habitat could be problematic.
In the open countryside, a final route was planned up to 25 m.
HS2 also specifies three options for the extensive high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is configuring the Y-shape, where a high-speed track should lead to the West Midlands.
The route is to be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and the other, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most powerful choice has been made," said the railroad expert.
Once this is done, the journey time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first phase, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the presence.
The proposals should allow trains to travel at 2250 miles per hour, making the UK’s network the fastest in Europe.
The starting line is already being designed to kidnap trains of 400 m in length, which would be able to transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London - Birmingham route.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be expanded to include a high-speed network.
Rail industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not be taken before the general election.
Even if it puts the wheels in motion, the grid should be built on parts.
Trains should first be put into service, not on high-speed routes, but on existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain driving times between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered a decisive point of contact for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a point of reference for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers pay a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 mortgage on Tory Orange
Alan Duncan, the front seat holder of the Torys in the House of Representatives, was paid by taxpayers thousands of pounds last year for the orangery he built in his house in the constituency.
A prison party spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "from dividends", raised his mortgage to <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-covered extension in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, totaling hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in a timely manner, so Sir Thomasen Legge, who was in charge of checking the members' expenses, was not interrogated. Last night, Mr Duncan expressed his demands "it could be cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of Parliament, owns two two-story houses in all of his constituencies Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
There's a kitchen, a living room and a dining room on the ground floor, but the financial office agreed to the assumption that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to the house, which in the plans is labeled as "orangeries".
Neighbors describe it as "a greenhouse for fun and expulsion".
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last audit by the Committee on General Standards and Privileges in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee informed him last month that he had violated the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed his pupil security to a mortgage of <0xC2><0xA3>27,1406 from his London property to a house in his constituency he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Representatives.
Documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan claimed about <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month in the interest of a mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims rose to over <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 a month.
The interest in the repayment of Mr Duncan’s RBS mortgage could not have changed at this time, suggesting that all of this was intended to finance a loan of <0xC2><0xA3>75,000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage repayment dropped from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, remaining.
The latest municipal authorities document shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 a month this year in May.
Mr Duncan left his job as a shadow leader of the House in September after a secret reporter filmed it and said MPs had to survive the spending scandal.
"In principle, it's nationalized, you have to live on assignment and treat you like a s**t."
He said: “I spent money on my garden and the right and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't do it."
The MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his issues in May when it turned out that he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before approval by the financial authority, that it "may be considered to be considered".
One of the activists dug a pound-shaped pit in Mr Duncan’s lawn to protest after it turned out he had claimed <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
When asked about a mortgage increase last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of a capital increase, which was approved by both the Financial Authority and subsequently by Legge."
He added: "This is not a controversial issue of hiding and clicking or breaking the rules or something else.
It's an absolutely straight line down, by the rules, legitimate and that's all.
This could not be easier or easier in many other ways.”
Come all carefully to see a cottage on the brighton coast with an advent calendar.
Brighton Coastal Cottages have found a new meaning to life in the early months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages ducal creativity has invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each day in December, and to use Christmas cakes as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cottage from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and with bishop bread and wine, provided for free.
Selected colleges included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First No<0xC3><0xAB>l, when the cabin represented Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-stipend priest at the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why do we as a church expect people to come to a foreign old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
“The idea of the Advent calendar in the cottages came about as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding an urgent and binding global warming deal to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrating around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and one hundred thousand according to organizers, were demonstrating in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt by Friday an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the president of the Danish climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, whose clear evidence is current demonstrations, contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of any failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to an AFP reporter, incidents took place in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the rally, when a group of about 300 protesters, dressed in black, began to break out the displays with tile bones and hammers.
The police force immediately intervened strongly.
A total of 600 to 700 people were arrested by police and clarified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups that were already demonstrating at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested “without distinction” and stressed that about a hundred of them were in the streets and sat “still on Saturday evening” and even over the weekend.
After leaving Parliament, the escort quietly went to the Bella Center, where the negotiations were held.
Protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate it.
A podium was erected for the speakers, before which a spiritual meeting was held at the candlesticks with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue coats, set up their first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning at the invitation of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create a "blue wave" for a "fair climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand an ecological debt settlement in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: it’s time for this, said Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and streams are drying up, we can walk in them today, and it has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement to fight for another world drew closer to ecological organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures fighting for another world, said he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "At the moment, there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world".
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people went to the streets, according to the organizers.
There were several hundred people in Manila, mostly students, in red clothes and with scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred protesters took to the streets demanding urgent action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people participated in protests organized by the 350 movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia condemns it as a "frasca"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the other hand, declared the move a "frake".
Approximately 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 to control South Ossetia, another former territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazia Election Commission, participation was 58% a few hours before the closing of the polling stations.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including the incumbent President Sergei Bagap<0xC5><0xA1>, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which condemned these elections.
These choices are frenzy.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "does regret that Abkhazia fell completely into Russian domination," his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
In addition to Russia, they recognized the independence of the territory with 216,000 inhabitants only in Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After the separation from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia tries to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said Kvarchija Svetlana, a 54-year-old historian, who also admitted to voting for President Bagapse.
She was one of those who came to vote in the school’s constituency in the capital, Suchumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian sovereignty is the main theme of the presidential election in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can boast of beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country of 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagapsh are distributed alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Galli, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to watch the successful course of the election were welcomed by district mayor Beslan Arshby.
"We, the Abkhazes, were grateful," he said at a small ceremony, referring to the support of Moscow and in particular its decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexey Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament and added a glass of vodka to it.
The opposition, represented in the elections by former Vice President Raul Khadzhimbo and two merchants Zausz Ardzinb and Beslan Boutbou, criticized last year’s contracts with Moscow, such as a deal that would allow the Russian Federation to take control of the 10-year-old.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive battle must take place within two weeks.
Climate: World events, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding an urgent and binding global warming deal to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrating around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested about 700 people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and one hundred thousand according to organizers, were demonstrating in the afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which until December 18 hosts delegates from 193 countries, discussing an agreement that could enter into force in 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the escort quietly went to the Bella Center, where the negotiations were held.
Protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate it.
A podium was erected for the speakers, before which a spiritual meeting was held at the candlesticks with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to an AFP reporter, incidents took place shortly after the departure of the corridor, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed in black and armed bricks and hammers, began to break out.
The police immediately surrounded them and attacked them without waiting, while several protesters crashed into the ground.
A total of 600 to 700 people were arrested by police and clarified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups that were already demonstrating at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
In the afternoon, one policeman was wounded by a tile skull on his forehead and four cars were burned near a squad near incidents, which resulted in about 20 people being detained according to police sources.
We are focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while police helicopters flew into the air again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue coats, set up the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning to challenge the group Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand an ecological debt settlement in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, one of the figures fighting for another world, said he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "At the moment, there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world".
Oxfam has called on several celebrities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people went to the streets, according to the organizers.
In Manila, in front of the capital city of the Philippines, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothes and with scarves evoking the importance of solar.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred protesters also met with a demand for urgent action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people participated in protests organized by the 350 movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general gymnasium, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said Sunday during an interview for JDD magazine that subjects of history and geography will be "polished" as part of the reform of general gymnasiums, although their teaching will no longer be mandatory in the last year of the gymnasium with a focus on the exact sciences.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and there will be the same program from the general culture for all of them, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "there is a need to end hypocrisy" because, according to him, the specialization S is no longer focused on the exact sciences "but "in essence, the best students are in it".
Specializations ES and L cannot be for some sub-specializations, he continues, emphasizing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have made it difficult for them to learn geography and history in the last year of professional high schools."
A survey by Ifop, which published the journal Humanité on Saturday, showed that seven out of ten (69 per cent) French people disagree with the government’s project to abolish compulsory history and geography teaching in the school yearbook with specializations in science, science, science and technology, and many of these intellects.
The minister, on the other hand, added that "it is not considered" to abolish the philosophy in the specialization program S of the graduation year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended reform in teaching education, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for participation in Tuesday’s mobilization against this project, which they say is sacrificing the pedagogical education of future high school professors.
As part of the Master’s degree 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, they will undergo an admission exam aimed at their field and at the end of the year a further exam verifying their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will participate in professional internships during the second year of the master’s degree and in the first year will perform as a professor-student in front of the students.
If you count all the internships that will be offered to you before admission, you will gain more experience with students, almost 300 hours, continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which is not yet in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite École Normale supérieur university, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen summit: this is a call announced this morning by Jean Jouzel, multi-president of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) at Ecole Normale Supérieure University in Ulm.
According to an AFP reporter, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the Ernest conference, a kind of one-day seminar consisting of fifteen-minute expert contributions to be filmed and opened to the public.
“We wanted to do something that would attract people and that would make them want to learn more,” said 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who was named after the fish from the local lake, after the student died.
Approximately twenty contributing experts from different scientific disciplines will be selected and clarified that the selection is based on their charisma.
“We can talk about warming for hours, but we can also summarize the basic targets in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel, speaking before 50 listeners without any pre-prepared notes, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that the audience will learn that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on very serious prepared scientific foundations".
The videos recorded in these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February and the next will be followed with regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: angry inmates in prisons, planned measures
The prison guards' unions on Friday announced a "general mobilization" as they demanded that they be paid premiums and overtime, which were postponed to January for financial reasons.
Prison FO (Second Supervisory Boards) called on employees who will not have the service to take part in demonstrations in front of prison facilities on Tuesday morning, and to "block" them, warning them of "theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (3rd of the sector) called for "convocation of meetings in individual prisons and initiate fundamental mobilization" with the fact that it is "sad and unacceptable" to "cut out overtime and surcharges for work at night, sleep at night, sleep at night, and sleep at night.
The first unions of guards, the Federal Union of Prison Guards (UFAP/UNA), "required for overall mobilization (...) in order to express dissatisfaction and indignation".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes has increased considerably in 2009 and have not all been included in the financial budget, but they ensure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The chancellor said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a message to the prison guards’ unions ensuring that the payment will be made next month.
I know about the efforts that prison personnel are making to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the minister writes in her statement.
I have ordered the Directorate-General of Prisons to take immediate action to ensure that the situation that resulted from the misappraisal of the number of overtimes is never repeated in the future, Minister Alliot-Marie added.
The December salary will therefore be low, with the exception of managerial staff who receive a famous premium for performing their functions and achieving their goals, Ufap/UNA said, and for those "there will always be a place in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, the interregional union of the FO in Marseille deplored and announced its decision to boycott the recall of "all meetings and calls".
Workers will not go to work on Sundays or on holidays unless they are paid an extra fee for these days from October in December, as well as in the case of overtime, the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also threatened.
At a time when more and more jobs and tasks are being given to us without providing us with additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-income employees to pay for it, says CGT prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, the funds are scarce, noted Ufap Secretary-General Jean-François Forget.
Obama Says He Gives “better Gifts” On Christmas Than He Receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, confided to the screen goddess Oprah Winfrey that in terms of gifts, he had a simple rule: “I give better gifts than those I receive.”
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the show, which will be broadcast on Sunday evening on ABC, about how they are going to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a small four-legged family member, gets his share.
Jesus likes Boa too, Michelle Obama said, saying that the dog will also receive a gift "of course", as it follows from the fragments of the pre-show show.
And Michelle Obama also turned against her husband’s claim on the quality of gifts she receives: “No, I certainly didn’t, I gave you some great gifts last year.”
Well, of course it's true, the president was forced to agree, but immediately afterwards, with humor, he pointed his finger to the pearl necklace of the first lady, "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous moderator, who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Obama’s husbands also talked about their favorite gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a 10-degree gear wheel, but also a basketball ball his Kenyan father gave him on Christmas Eve, which he rarely met.
“I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas, and he gave me the basketball,” the president said.
It was not until long afterwards that I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The first lady once again remembered the house for dolls.
I didn’t know how to organize everything in the house, so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved the little dollhouse, Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Says He's In Artificial Sleep
Johnny Hallyday was once again operated in Los Angeles due to "injuries" arising after a major operation he underwent in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while RTL said the singer is in an artificial sleep to prevent a coaxial pain.
The 66-year-old rocker was once again operated on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "an injury resulting from the surgery" a deadly stool he had undergone in Paris, reported the operation on November 26, according to a report.
The singer's press department, however, tried to calm the public and said the situation was "under control" and at the same time announced that new medical communications would be released within 48 hours.
According to RTL, which is the lead partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to avoid "pain and complications".
Within 48 hours, when the patient opens the eyes, we will have a little more certainty, RTL adds.
The press department, at the request of AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also says that, according to "some sources", no drones were placed in Paris after the first operation.
Rocker was operated on at the international clinic Parc Monceau due to an extinct plotter.
The surgery, which was planned a few days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in the art circles.
But the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on RTL information.
After the operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection that occurred after the operation.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallydaye, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a "bad period", but added that he "doesn't worry about the rocker" because he's a big "warrior".
“He called me just before I went to Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing a fool because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation is no fun,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, said Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that the infection was "stop".
Mr. Camus also said that he met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he did not notice any special concerns.
The singer’s health problems have only increased since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to surprise everyone, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on for a "small intestine tumor" and then for a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, each of his health problems has been closely monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to dementia the news of a new hospitalization again.
Euro-2009/Small Pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Cup in a large pool, won the title at the 2009 European Championship in a small pool in Istanbul on Thursday in a discipline he particularly likes: the 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championship, the last time the suits were allowed, only three world records fell, although much more were expected.
One of them was overtaken by Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztová in the 200 m position race and the other two men's teams in Russia in the 4x50 m position race.
A great sadness for Bousquet, who made the world record for the 50 m freeway, who is already the holder of the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two Royal Swimming Disciplines, a 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final in which ten swimmers made their debut instead of the regular eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikova (20.84), but failed to beat the world record (20.30), as he predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if the world record is within my reach, I will try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore suits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The combinations have helped 238 world records since February 2008 and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host them in 1999 in the same competition.
The use of the suit this time did not help the Germans to Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in a large swimming pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the 400-meter freestyle record (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Madsen Glaesner (3:36.
I didn't put everything in that race.
I knew I wouldn’t beat the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: Zolo's sarcophagus record was stolen for <0x24>1.5 million
A board of the Romanesque sarcophagus, which belonged to no one but French writer Emile Zolov, was issued on Thursday for <0x24>1.5 million, which is significantly more than estimated, Sotheby’s art dealer said.
The price of this two-meter-long and 63 cm-high front panel, dating from the third century B.C.E., was estimated at <0x24>150,000 to <0x24>250,000.
Marble "representing four Dionysos scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satires and bakchants is a rare work, similar pieces are very few, maybe four or five in the world," the AFP said in a statement on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it’s the subject that was most targeted, Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola got this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The board has been in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgian family and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated her bath in her private hotel in Paris and with Paul Reynaud, the minister of the Third Republic in France at the time of the Marches and in the past.
It remained there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz discovered while searching the database of the Louvre Museum that this board was part of "Emil Zola's remains" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the frescoes "Rougon-Macquart".
Interrupted attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico said on Thursday it did not meet the conditions for the transfer of the deposed President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the insurgents refused to grant a guarantee of a safe departure.
“After a phone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything attests to the fact that there is no way to realise this transfer,” said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinos.
A Mexican government plane that arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya's return flew back, a source from the Directorate-General for Migration said.
The Putschist government wanted to push President Zelaya to “resign” and to apply for political asylum abroad, only in this way would it give him the chance to leave safely.
But the deposed president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the head of state of exile.
The Putschist government “has experienced another failure when it wanted me to resign from office (...), they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which it often expresses itself to the political crisis that has been going on for five months in this Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the deposed president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a couple of chords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the Interior Minister of the Punjab government, Oscar Raul Matute, said on Wednesday.
“I will not ask for asylum from any country,” Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur station based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduras people, he stressed.
The rumors of Zelaya’s departure mobilized in the middle of a downtrodden president’s supporters, who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the army reinforced protection.
Brazil’s foreign minister, Celso Amorim, has criticized the government’s stance.
They demonstrate their marginal stance on international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who approached Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chávez, was thrown down on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election, against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
He returned unexpectedly from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of here, he will be arrested and accountable for the crime of "trafficking", of which he is accused, the Putschist government says.
President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace President Zelaya.
In the controversial elections, recognized by the United States, but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya’s return to power until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance drives optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended Thursday with an increase, and U.S. trade balance results show an increase in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to data from the final closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and Nasdaq, with a technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 Index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegzová of FTN Financial.
But we can’t take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on “half a full glass”.
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focusing primarily on U.S. business balance sheet figures, “which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade balance deficit fell 7.6% in October compared to September, to <0x24>32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected an increase in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which is a reflection of the growth of the economies of the United States’ main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment rose against all expectations and the number of job seekers reached 474,000.
But in the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "to the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market also declined.
State Treasury profits with a 10-year outlook rose to 3.482 percent from 3.423 percent on Tuesday night and 30-year earnings rose to 4.492 percent from 4.408 percent the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the regime chanted "Damas in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime on Thursday slapped the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented further protests, where dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dam in White", husbands or close political prisoners, were depressed on the streets of Raul Castro's regime supporters as they marched towards the capital's centre with a demand for the release of political prisoners, the reporter said.
Along with the Yankees!, "The Merchants!", "The Streets Belong to the Revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!", the regime's supporters chanted with a raised fist for dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who came to "ensure security".
The day before, a similar demonstration against the Dams in White took place in Havana, but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana’s Vedado district, some ten dissidents were detained in civilian custody, which were also about to protest on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, AFP reported.
According to this reporter, the police imposed dissidents, who were scribbling supporters of the government regime into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents in similar conditions usually only takes a few hours.
The holders of the Sakharov Prize for the European Parliament for 2005, "Ladies in White" organised an unauthorized march for "launching all, according to the disc, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is punishing 20 years of flight.
Mr Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be “merchants” or “agents” paid by their main enemy, the United States.
A miracle, Cuban television brought a report about Thursday’s demonstration of supporters of the government regime against “revolutionary supporters.”
Cuba, headed by the Communist Party and one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of not respecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman killed an 80-year-old man and wounded 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A man armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Houts-de-Seine) at a peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary findings of the investigation, the attacker, aged 28, allegedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons an eighty-year-old man in a pharmacy or in front of her, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
A severely wounded old man, born in 1929, died in hospital, according to the Alliance Police Syndicate.
In this pharmacy or in front of it, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
My husband, who was about thirty years old, started defending himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The lives of the other injured are at risk, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," a police source said.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still on Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two more people, apparently by chance: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
How this happened is not entirely clear, as it all happened in the evening.
He was armed with two knights carrying a cross behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several spectators, including young people, have, according to AFP’s testimony, tried to stop and disarm the insane.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green coat.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on the situation of Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
He was shot by a crowd, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city policemen, including their commander, tried to detain an armed man and were wounded with fist, a police source said.
The incident took place in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
The next day, I was told that there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, laid him in a safe place, and noticed big wounds on my belly, Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, the second about thirty-year-old, who also had pointed wounds with a knife, disappeared.
The man who had no identity documents with him was subsequently arrested by the state police.
The State Attorney in Nanterre handed over the case to the Highs-de-Seine County Police Investigation Department (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody, waiting for an interrogation.
A police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric clinic.
Another police source said that six police officers were needed to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "completely out of the way" as "all the madmen of this type, whose strength in action increases tenfold."
U.S.: Polanski’s lawyer again requests to end criminal prosecution
The lawyer of the Polish-French director Roman Polanski again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) demanded a halt to criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to a moratorium in the city of Los Angeles.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the director of the film "Pianist" criticized before three judges of the Second District Court of Appeal, California, the serious mistakes that occurred during the trial at the time of the events in 1977.
I call for a halt to the prosecution now and immediately, Hummel said, adding that from the behavior of the judge, who at the time ruled in the case, Laurence Rittenband "had a cold in his back".
According to him, the judge (who has already died) had to deal with a prosecutor who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to jail – which is a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information about this conversation appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and requested), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells eventually declared at the end of September that he "lied" to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop criminal proceedings, Hummel’s lawyer will require a prosecution in which he will be able to present evidence of his claim.
The prosecutor reiterated what had already been said at the first state hearing, namely that no serious examination of the request for an halt to criminal prosecution will be carried out until Roman Polanski is brought before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the court ruled in a case of “illegal sexual intercourse” with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never entered the United States again.
Los Angeles prosecutor Phyllis Asayamova said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial."
We want to point out, in this case, not only to Roman Polaski, but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape? asked Mrs Asayamova.
It is the view that the director "demands a court favor and at the same time despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make the decision, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape."
Lawyer Hummel was not the only one who demanded the cessation of Roman Polanski's criminal prosecution.
The victim's legal representative, Samantha Geimer, also asked for the end of the criminal prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate this eternal harassment every time Polanski's case emerged, adding: "No one in this room can say that the process was fair."
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on U.S. orders.
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to a domestic prison in his Gstaad cottage, where he is awaiting eventual deportation.
Wall Street ends without direction, slowing down the rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market is confused between indicators that are better than expected in the U.S. and the rising price of the dollar: Dow Jones gained <0x2B>0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average progressed from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance left 0.55 points and ended up at 2,190.31 points.
Standard & Poor's 500 Index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of the trade has decreased greatly and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
This trend has also been confirmed by publishing economic indicators that are better than expected and that “helped improve the mood in the market when it comes to the stability of economic recovery,” analyst Charles Schwab summed up.
Retail sales in the U.S. rose by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate from the University of Michigan index, U.S. consumer confidence has also returned and rose sharply in December to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the index was slowed down by a new rise in the dollar’s price against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which “presses down sensitive sectors to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological actions thus lose ground under the feet.
The securities market has fallen.
State Treasury revenues with a 10-year outlook rose to 3,540% from 3,482% on Wednesday evening, and with a 30-year outlook increased to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa.
After a month-long trip across South Africa, 112 Miss World candidates are set to exceed their goal of achieving their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great beauty celebration took place in the vicinity of Johannesburg in the second year and so far, five candidates have won the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiana Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Mao from Canada were selected during their African stay Miss sport or Miss top model.
It was a true faith of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
“I’ve seen so many things and I have so many experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which takes place in South Africa after the ninth, will be broadcast live from Midrand, in the north of Johannesburg, starting at 5:00 p.m. (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country in which I put my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I’m happy to have been able to experience it twice, said Miss Ksenia Sukhin of the World, in the hot southern summer.
For the young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was carried in the spirit of numerous encounters with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "breathing country".
After a month of performances, exams, press meetings and safari, Miss focuses on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopra hopes to take the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who will also take part in the election of Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winners, who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman’s dream, but it’s not just about appearance.
“We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with a crown,” said Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th anniversary will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The performance will be presented by Chinese television presenter Angela Chow, former beauty queen of South Africa Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is difficult to cope with, said Julia Morley, the president of the Miss World Competition.
Like last year, the candidates took part in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bike, and tasted local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for the president, Mrs. Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could have met people I hadn't even dreamed of.
I will definitely be back at the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastically Miss Italy Alice Taticchiova.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive".
The news about Johnny Hallyday’s condition is “very positive,” as his son David assured us at his arrival at Los Angeles Airport on Friday, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
"It's very strong and everything is going very well," said David Hallyday on his flight from Paris shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, who acted calmly, said he would be taken "as soon as possible" to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday because of a postoperative infection caused by a heated intervertebral splint in a 26-spoke leaflet.
According to a press release, the singer's night in Los Angeles was "leaded to artificial sleep" for convenience, which is intended to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was admitted to an artificial sleep by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles and was hospitalized due to an infection following a deadly intervertebral surgery on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday.
According to AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a French high school performance in Los Angeles on Friday morning, which was attended by their daughter Jade.
Yves Catoné, the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Hospital la Pitié-Salpêtrière, said he will fly to Los Angeles on Monday.
Producer strongly accused Dr Stéphana Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were in a riot, Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus thinks Johnny Hallyday "was going too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon."
I personally spoke to the doctor by phone and he assured me that this route was no problem, which surprised me greatly, since I myself had already had twice the heat of the intervertebral curtain, he added.
A moment earlier on the radio station RTL said that the singer apparently flew off after the Paris operation without a drone, without anything.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the art circles.
He operated on the actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he worked at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove the hematoma caused by brain bleeding.
He is, of course, also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times convicted in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
Attorney Olivier Metzner called him a "man without scruples" who is "regularly" summoned to the medical chamber, and who cannot even be "recommended far away."
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said the operation was "very good" and that the postoperative examination was "normal".
The operation was not of a hemorrhagic nature, so the introduction of the drain was not necessary,” he added.
The singer’s health problems have been increasing since this summer and, in any case, his next tour seems to be left with a questionnaire.
It is clear that the date for the planned renewal of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, <0xD0><0x90><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB0>) seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF raises the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre to stop enjoying their abbreviation.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayrou, responded on Friday to the attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, to appropriate the former Giscard's party with the fact that the abbreviation should not be used in any media under threat.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to acquire the UDF shortcut, saying that François Bayrou did not deserve to carry her legacy after giving his left hand.
The defense minister, whose side is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC) movement.
This move was supported by the Member of Parliament Hervé de Charetta (formerly a member of the UMP now for the NC), who attributes ownership of the UDF brand, since it was the first to be registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the committee of the UDF-managed association of friends of François Bayrou, who do not intend to be expropriated, resigned from his silence and filed a formal request to the minister and MPs to stop using the abbreviation and to hand back the property, underprotecting them.
In recent days, you have raised a worrying statement that you are proposing to your political movement to retake the abbreviation UDF, writes the Association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including Artois Bayrou from France or Mariei Bayrou from France and Ally De Sarnez from France.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name<0x2B>Nouveau centre<0x2B>, with the slogan <0x2B>UDF today<0x2B>, also note the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF Committee, which requests the NC Movement "immediately remove all mentions of the UDF name from all promotional materials including (your) website".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the trademark ownership to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will appeal to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement of 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "chosen" leaving in 2007, "to create a competitive movement, as did others in 2002 to establish the UMP.
According to them, the New Centre has no right to use the abbreviation Union pour la démocratie française (UDF).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to create a committee responsible for defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered the trademark", he was "not a member of the UDF for three years", but UMP.
In a scandalous and deceptive way, he used non-existent acronym registrations to do so on his own account.
This inactivity begins to turn into a crime, they declare, and then ironically express themselves to the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that it is more valuable in politics and in ordinary life to create a name for itself than to emerge from the anonymity of a right that is not misleading to accept."
Liliane Bettencourt’s case: François-Marie Banier will be convicted of abuse of the state of weakness.
The Nanterre court on Friday decided to sue artist Françoise-Marie Banier and decide whether he used the 80-year-old billionaire’s weakness to prepare her for part of her estate, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blamed for.
A photographer (62 years old), known for his photographs of celebrities, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abusing the state of weakness, a crime for which a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of 375 000 euros is imposed.
This decision confirms that a trial is indeed taking place in a case that can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter attack each other and fight for the rule of the cosmetic empire of L'Oréal.
However, the 15th criminal court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be conducted by a college of three doctors.
L’Oréal’s heir and principal shareholder has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the State Prosecutor’s Office in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors to be elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time state whether Liliana Bettencourt could be in a state of weakness and in what period.
I think she's going to be subdued.
I will talk to her about the matter, Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
With regard to the lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, the court’s decision was welcomed.
This is a great report (...). Expertise shows that with this old lady in need of protection, she has been manipulating (M. Banier), confirmed.
It’s been two years since Liliana Bettencourt’s only daughter opened a criminal case against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and omniscient artist who has been accused of using her mother’s state of weakness for many years to earn a billion euros in paintings, or even a life-form.
Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer whom she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of the lawsuit filed by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday’s lawyers’ court speech changed from time to time into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt’s lawyer submitted three letters, which her client sent to her notary in 1999, 2003 and 2005, in which she expressed her distrust of her husband Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years once or twice a day.
Ever since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The State Prosecutor’s Office in Nanterre once again found that the complainant’s proceedings were not justified, in addition to the fact that the custodial judge rejected her request to initiate proceedings to provide legal protection for her mother these days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of attending a court, is not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her,” said Marie-Christine Daubigny, the attorney general’s office.
Finally, the Court ruled that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be entitled to speak at the time of the initiation of the proceedings.
The Management Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was futile...
For more than a decade, the management behavior of large companies has been reminiscent of the company’s approach to consumers before the marketing revolution: it’s about identifying employees with “values” determined from the mountains, as it was before, when it was necessary to use the equipment that was needed from the production.
By becoming the center of business companies, the marketing revolution compared the strategy of conquering the market in the right direction...and when authoritarian efforts to enforce products, other than customer preferences, return regularly!
Employees’ passive approach can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon, which affects mostly managerial staff.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, the EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) an active approach and ability to predict" and demands from employees commitments that are completely contrary to the revenues of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that aims to put the employees at the center of the interest of the company as well as the client.
Relative utility of internal surveys of public opinion.
Will internal public opinion surveys – as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees – contribute to the revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I’ve already convinced myself that faced with a new situation, the structure after different turns comes back to what it’s always done!
Moreover, authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases proportionately with the gravity of its own failures.
And finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of colleges for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of thought comfort, they adopt an old behaviorist theory, now revived by "neurology" from the United States and widely spread without greater knowledge by the scientific institute and the media.
With the possibility of moving "sic" managers' involvement, a recent survey by Ipsos showed on Figaro.fr, which only identifies managers in their position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises assumes the adoption of the final vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating the basic view into all management intentions and practices : Employees will only be able to commit to the company if they appear as a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation is only concerned with the study of Motivational Functional Analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined doxy, which will allow them, through a picture that describes the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "on the right path".
This creates a nutritious ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
In a speech from Oslo: "Just War" Obama deserved praise from the right hand.
U.S. law on Friday welcomed the speech that Barack Obama delivered the day before in Oslo, pleased that the recipient of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of a "fair war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who first laughed at Obama’s October 9 award, applauded the presidential speech, this time including Sarah Palin, former vice presidential candidates in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Palin, a right-wing Republican muse, for the USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself had expressed the "sometimes necessary" wars on the subject in her memories that are coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing that Americans would like to have at work, but it is necessary.
All terrorists must be detained there, it is believed.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, on Thursday justified the deployment of forces in Oslo and used a speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan in the nine pre-war period.
Obama’s next opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a “very good job” in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who appreciated above all the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I considered this speech to be quite historic, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, who some consider to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see the "left president" reminding the members of the Nobel Prize committee that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the prize for peace.
According to Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama presented a "very American speech".
Not only did he present himself as a "world citizen" as he always did, but he "speaked like a U.S. president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble they didn't create themselves, and that they don't do too much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Few right-wing discontenters include Bush-era crane, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "uniform, witty, and without inspiration", as stated on the National Review Online website.
Left of the president, for example, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is frightened when he sees Barack Obama as justifying the use of force.
“If we wrap the war in a package of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people,” he warned.
However, the middle-left press holds a commendable position against the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times still considers the awarding of the Obama Peace Prize to be premature, it has assessed his performance as a "over-performance" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression," the California daily said.
Obama "made the speech that was necessary," the New York Times assessed, denoting the speech as "easy and informative".
Road carriers: three marathons to a deal that will save supplies for Christmas.
After three negotiation marathons, trade unions of road carriers and TLF, the only employers' organization that remained until the end, arrived at an agreement on Friday evening that ended the call for strike and the threat that was hanging over supply to the Vano.
Transport secretary of state Dominique Bussereau expressed "joy" at Friday's signing of the deal after several talks that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussion, the negotiators broke up early in the morning on Friday with the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
Despite the fact that three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have resigned from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours of the meeting, which began at 11 p.m., to get everyone to agree and at 18 p.m. to sign the agreement.
This conflict "would seriously harm businesses" and "threaten to disrupt holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text contains a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest wages increases from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.72 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9.06.
It’s not much, but there’s a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we're going to give our members an order to avoid blockades, no blockades to supply centers.
But there may be several other opponents who are not satisfied,” he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed the "correct deal", although it was difficult to admit the increase in high wages due to international competition.
According to him, there will be an increase of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>170 per month for the lowest wages and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>120 for the highest.
It is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historical agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also envisages a revaluation of travel expenses of 3% and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the issue of the 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million reduction in corporate wage taxes" which was the subject of the government's amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which was voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government calls on the Senate to vote "consistently".
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to enterprises that are members of this organization, later to the entire sector, in the case of an extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place “in the shortest possible time,” said Bussereau.
The whole process can only be interrupted by the disagreement of employers’ organisations.
The FNTR is talking about "bad trade" as 100 million euros "were already offered to the sector as part of compensation for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to an emergency meeting, not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to spoil the food of the turtle during the upcoming Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the deal threatens to "bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises from the sector" in the next 12 months.
Suburban RER A trains: interruption of traffic on weekends, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
The interruption on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, as Friday's trade union negotiations with RATP on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results.
On Saturdays and Sundays, the days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only travel between 10am and 20pm, in the main section (between La Défense and the Nation), every second train will travel outside this section only one train out of four.
The connection to SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
The Galeries Lafayette stores, which await more than 200,000 customers every day, have welcomed the fact that "RATP has sought to secure a connection with large stores."
The RER A line leads from west to east of the Paris agglomeration.
The section managed by RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one of the two trains was at the top of the line, and virtually no set was running out of time, as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion in the staircases.
So early in the morning there were far fewer people in the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, among other things, because students and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he had risen about an hour and a half early to make sure he was arriving in time.
The Saint-Lazare station was not crowded, the SNCF State Railways said, because a greater number of founders and guards were predicted to be in order.
Suburban trains RER A operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a subway connection.
The next general meeting of the strikes will be held on Saturday and Sunday, at which the results of Friday afternoon’s meeting with the leadership, which the trade unions rated as “weak,” will be assessed.
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for suburban RER A trains on all sides, adjustment of working hours, career progress, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand the deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (Committee of the South).
The RATP has even delayed proposals for the premium so far, which haunted CGT with the fact that the management "was not able to solve the problem while the passenger carriers and the SNCF did."
The new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, will "review the conditions for the performance of the profession", the RATP said.
That’s why trade unions think the business “makes it a joke from weekend travelers.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupy the business committee at its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which so far rejected any discussion during the strike, therefore decided to meet in the interest of "relaxation".
There is a risk that the conflict will extend to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independence announced the strike alert.
Trade unions apply for premiums ranging from 120 (UNA) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros of variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Independants (Independent)) and are struggling with deteriorating working conditions on this line, which carries millions of passengers daily.
RER train drivers earn 2,200 to 2,700 euros of gross salary and 600 to 650 euros of premiums for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and holidays.
Turkey’s justice has dissolved for the Kurdish side and this decision has serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled on the annulment of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision prompted protests in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to hand the Kurdish community a friendly hand and try to end the 25-year conflict.
The Party for Democratic Society (DTP) was disbanded as it became "a niche of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Hasim Kilic, president of the Supreme Court, told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was unanimously taken by 11 judges, when a majority of seven votes were needed to dissolve the party, Kilic said, adding that 37 party cadets including its President Ahmeta Türk and MP Aysely Tugluková should be banned from taking part in political life.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity used by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's property by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP Party has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 500).
The party’s leadership had already warned before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act in it as non-political Members.
The decision is a continuation of the trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obedience to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is the legal political display of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures that it has no "basic connection" with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes at a time when the government is giving the Kurdish community a friendly hand, offering a range of measures to strengthen their rights, and trying to limit Kurdish support for the PKK, thereby ending the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a renewed tension in southeastern Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations have collapsed against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan is detained in clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the decision of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast that is predominantly Kurdish.
The police used tear grenades and waterworks, protesters throwing Molotov’s cocktails or shooting stones from the prairies.
Almost a hundred people were also demonstrating in Istanbul.
After the verdict was issued, Mr Türk said that the decision of justice only "profounds despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurds, revision) by banning the party, he said in a press release.
The government, which is a party from the Islamist movement, has also condemned this decision.
We are in principle against disruption of parties.
There is no solution to this, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete dismissal of the democratic proposals initiated by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK reported one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow may come
This is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants to do.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the winter department of FES technical services.
But in order for his employees to try and learn to control all the driving techniques.
This could be the first time that meteorologists say it will happen this weekend.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES then proceeds according to the exact schedule.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, they go to 20 so-called A-segments, explains Brauburger.
These sections include the main and transit trails such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and declining sections like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle moist salt for a maximum of three hours, which holds better, some about 1040 kilometers.
That’s why the FES starts at three o’clock at night, “so that the roads are free until the transport to work begins”.
It's not easy when it starts to snow until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, "because no one is willing to make a place for the squirrels."
Only when there is so much snow is there a number of incoming and connecting communications, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're going to complain there.
At five o’clock in the morning, the FES pedestrians will go on their journey, preferring to clean dangerous places and passages.
FES can usually not take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that follows the bridges from 22:00 to 4:30, says Brauburger.
Because they quickly form a glacier, the squirrels leave as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call them.
Dinosaur bed
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal was two meters long and 1.50 meters tall running on two strong rear ends, had an elongated skull with sharp, bent teeth, short front ends with skulls.
If this species lived a few million years later, it would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine write that Tawa halllae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these body features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then located in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about relatives, extensions, and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is invisible to triassic settlements, team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah reports.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, the remains of a total of five individuals were collected.
The findings confirm the theory of the early history of the dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the Sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "Triace dinosaur fossils are very rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This discovery is not particularly sensational, but it is confirmed by some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, for example, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly controversial.
Experts discuss, for example, when the dwarfs were divided into three main developmental lines: carnivorous theropods, which later belonged to Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, "long-hearted" nymphs, four-legged sauropods, and three-legged squirrels, and squirrels.
Tawa hallae is the original therapeutic after analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers have found evidence of air bags that the descendants of terropods also have birds.
Thanks to air bags, bird breathing is more effective than mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive teropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the family line of giant sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, this useful innovation has probably already created a common ancestor for both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America.
Since the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists have claimed that it was the first time that dinosaurs appeared there.
According to this, the three lines of development were split early and spread from South America to all the continents that at the time, as the supercontinent of Pangea, formed a unified mass of the earth.
She would speak for the fact that the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related teropods.
The three cannot come from one common, immigrant ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the study.
Of course, there are contradictions as well.
Another older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in today’s Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could put together a distorted picture, because in South America very many primitive dinosaurs fossils have been preserved, with rarely found on other continents.
As the dinosaurs have proved, from a relatively rare sub-line of the genus of dinosaurs evolved to the dominant vertebrates of the earth in the times of the Middle Ages, it remains a puzzle.
During the trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other beaches, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying dwarfs and countless other dwarfs.
Around the end of the trias, dinosaurs spread all over the world and many new species evolved, while relatives died out and the trias and jury interface.
The history of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
The dinosaurs may have survived a mass extinction, but the beach is not.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better, so they could push the competition out.
The history of success didn’t last forever anyway.
150 million years later, the impact of a meteorite helped another group of animals, which also evolved in the trias and lived in the shadows since then: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, or Berkeley, California.
They joined faculty from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearing of the occupying Goethe University’s Frankfurt-based casino has taken care of a global uprising.
278 professors and teachers from Goethe University, but also colleges across Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarizing with protesting students on campus Westend.
In a statement in German and English, they "disapprove" of the president-induced police intervention.
Because the walls and artworks were demolished, University President Werner Müller-Estler allowed the building to be cleared by strikers and lecturers last week.
Five of the students were injured.
The damage, the signatories say, does not justify "violent dissolution of self-organized education of students and teaching by the police command".
Clearing is an "unacceptable interference" in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "illegalize and criminalize the protest" and diverts attention from the content.
The Bureau avoided the necessary discussions.
The lecturers call for the cessation of criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most of the strikers did not support material damage.
Legitimate Protest
The youth union organisation Verdi and the German trade union are also solidarizing with students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hessian Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is defending the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the President of the University.
Destruction and occupation are absolutely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in the Aktuelle Stunde in the Wiesbaden Landparlament.
We have an understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Left saw this.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the students’ arguments and demands, there was a clearing.
Linke made a proposal calling on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the police deployment.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a strictly monitored location where secret weapon research was conducted.
Today, this district of 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centers are located here.
Since September 2008, Green City representatives have been in contact with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits took place and on Wednesday, in Frankfurt, Zelenograd and Ridberg signed the "Protocol of Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow vice-major Yuri Rosljak and the prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, signed by chief planning rapporteur Edwin Schwarz behind Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will attend a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientist exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
FIZu will be allowed to take advantage of the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific firms want to acquire contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to important Russian research institutes and companies.
Among them are the Moscow Institute of Electronics Engineering, the large Sitronics Group and Rossijskaja Elektronik.
The period was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist planned city" for military research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the forested hilly countryside in which research facilities are planted.
The Stuttgart Brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be prepared enough at all.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply a "new heart of Europe".
Okay, the S21 is more than a station launch, more than a monstrous building that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg for a decade into a desperate building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 80s.
The main stations with railways that ended in the city center were then considered to be 19th-century transport-technical fossils, which act as brakes for modern rail transport, because it took a huge amount of time to brake the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Take it, stop for a moment, move on - that's how it should work.
And that’s why the main station disappears: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
It actually starts with the S21, although the 1980s vision is no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realized that in the Hesse and Bavaria metropolitan areas, the start of construction is almost unfundable.
Since there have been modern trains with motor and steering vehicles on both ends, the main stations no longer have problems with going and going.
Still: Starting with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE route to Ulm.
This was done by local and local politicians.
Dra<0xC5><0xBE>y cooperate, even because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state group.
Urbanistically, the project can be excused in some way.
A new urban space will be created, which – if we trust the computer images of the designers – will contain a lot of greenery.
The S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the construction of the tracks are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern transport policy, however, must first and foremost be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road cars.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
What is even more serious is that the S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion was to be buried in Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion real.
It is clear that in the next decade, there will be a lack of funding for further nodes and narrow places on the network.
Sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of a 180-kilometre long route in the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, this route has been being built at a slow pace.
It would have to be pushed right here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The route through the Rhine Valley will become the throat of a bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is investigating the decision on the airport.
The Land government has left the Wiesbaden Landparlament open as to whether it will go against the ruling of the Hesse Administrative Court of Justice (VGH) on the prohibition of night flights and let it be revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition commissioned experts to legally assess more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
VGH in Kassel today argued in writing that the state would have to re-amend the night flight ban in the case of construction of the planned northwestern ranch of Frankfurt Airport.
A permit of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as the Earth government predicts, is not in line with the law to protect the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 if it will require a revision of the ruling.
The opposition criticized the postponement and sent a government representative to renounce the Federal Administrative Court's review in Leipzig.
SPD head Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to return to their promises regarding the ban on night flights she had made before the election, otherwise it can be judged as a "violation of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word," Greens boss Tarek Al-Wazir said in a rally to the FDP election slogan, "We keep our word."
Minister Posch has rejected the invitation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the country’s government is trying to get to its night flights through “re-enforcement of the law and tricks”.
Exact legal checks need their time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need realistic decisions, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
His faction’s statements on the ban on night flights have never been the way the opposition puts them.
U.S. Banks Pay Aid
U.S., the crisis shook big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
Bank of America paid a total of <0x24>45 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion) on Wednesday.
According to CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to pay off state aid.
Thus, the constitutions want to get rid of the restrictions that came with the acceptance of money - the restriction of bonus payments to managers and the reimbursement of high fees.
The Bank of America has secured <0x24>19 billion in cash from investors thanks to its swapable bonds.
The rest of the money was taken from her cash register, which was filled, among other things, by professional sales.
Bank Chief Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday evening thanked the U.S. taxpayer: The money injections helped us overcome a difficult time.
The monetary institution was damaged at the height of the financial crisis by the acquisition of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup wants to free itself from its commitments to the state by also holding money on the capital market.
CNBC, citing sources, said the U.S. bank could announce a capital increase of around <0x24>20 billion on Thursday.
The Citigroup spokesman did not want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid for help.
A Quick Choice
After all, it went just faster than expected.
The station was introduced as a successor only two weeks after the board of directors of the ZDF expelled editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender.
Last night, the Gremium wanted to agree on that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in the Berlin capital, was named a favorite.
But the station did not confirm it - officially not to precede the trial.
However, the role could also be the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if the proposal was not passed by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schachter's candidate, needs the support of nine out of 14 members of the gremium.
The outcome of the vote was not known until the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, he lost his job on the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Bränder, seven against him, and the loss of Bränder's mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although it was expected.
The majority of the EU’s board of directors has already signaled several weeks before the elections that they do not want to confirm Brender in office.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief was organized by Hesse Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He declined further stay in the office of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief on the grounds that Brender had reduced the monitoring quotas of the ZDF news broadcast.
So, until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
Last year, 35 state-run lawyers were involved in the debate, who considered Koch’s approach unconstitutional.
It wasn't for nothing.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to the ZDF, first to the "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal reference editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; to 1998 head and moderator "Morgenmagazins"; to 2001 head of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then head of the main studio of the ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected by the expert journal Medium Magazine as journalist of the year on Wednesday, was sacked, the Greens announced they were filing a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch’s opponent in the board, Rhine-Westphalian Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that states should change the state deal with the ZDF so that the candidate’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also refused the exclusion of party politicians from the ZDF supervisory boards.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, was given a clever chess tactic to the board of directors - he criticized the gremium for it immediately after Brender's beating.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schachter could nominate him as editor-in-chief without losing his face, and he could be elected to the board of directors without being suspected of being pushed to office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is nowhere near the left-wing liberals.
Studying to get rid of harampads
Partial success for students: After a year of strike, on Thursday, the Ministers of Culture finally took over to the Federal Countries: At the Conference of Culture Ministers and College Rectors, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for bachelor’s and master’s degrees.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: In essence, each module should be completed with a single exam.
In addition, the workload of students should be checked and a "real and defensible level" should be ensured.
Politicians and colleges want to simplify the recognition of exams between colleges in Germany and abroad.
The Federal Countries are committed to creating a more flexible common structural assignment for bachelor and master’s degree fields.
Earthly deviations should cease to exist.
Less Testing
Since the start of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Culture and the university rectors have spoken in their mouths about better study.
This is the first time they have been filled with specific content.
The so-called accreditation board concluded that the number of tests is partially drastically reduced: "Each module will usually be completed with only one test," says a 30-page report, which is partly intended to re-regulate the approval of study disciplines.
"A considerably lower test load," said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the accreditation board, "is to stop a misdevelopment that significantly limited the challenge of the study."
To this end, the "complexity of the study" in the future should be a "decisive criterion" in the implementation.
Modules and contents must be "hardly checked" so that "students are not unnecessarily restricted in choice"
seminars."
Students should have “a learning space that enables and supports their own initiative.”
The rules should apply when approving new fields of study, after reviewing, but also for existing fields of study.
They need to be "recredited" every five years – which means that it will take until 2015 before all areas of study are reviewed.
There are 10 accreditation agencies in charge throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation boards established by the federal states.
In October, the ministers of culture called on the federal government to act on the agencies so that the tuition is not too large and the trial regime is not strict.
In individual federal countries, universities and colleges have already agreed with the land ministries on appropriate measures.
As so far, only one country has promised Rhine-Westphalia additional resources for further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, universities should primarily pay for consulting programs and study consulting, and strengthen the testing and foreign authorities.
For this, countries and universities want to spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to introduce a novel of higher education law to the parliament.
According to her, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
The training of the study should be even more flexible, to ensure the recognition of exams from other universities and to facilitate the availability of the master.
By the end of next year, the demands of all fields of study in the country should be reviewed.
The government and the opposition again discussed the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to the praise, the criticism of the resolution also fell.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Groups called on Juso to ensure that the development of education policy does not take place "at the closed doors" of ministers and higher education rectors in the future.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word should be spoken" should also students as affected persons.
The future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of College Rectors (HRK), Margrety Wintermantel: “We need the experience of students,” she said at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with whom the HRK was discussing a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: They require a legal claim that would allow every graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a construction master’s degree.
Secondly, the federal government must ensure that tomorrow there will be enough posts in master’s courses with the best possible study conditions for today’s generation of undergraduate students, GEW chairman Andreas Keller said.
Federal states must employ far more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on free access to the Master’s programmes.
More than a note under the spell of Hert Müller
Getting into and out of Germany is nice, almost no control...” is the opening line of a poem by Werner Söllner, who in this torn piece of language thematicizes the experience of travelling with a dissident, who gained his freedom, but gained his freedom.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, first worked as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of a children's book publishing house, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum at Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A major non-military riot took place last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich on “German literature in Romania in the mirror and the broken mirror of its security acts”.
Apparently disillusioned and infected, Söllner left a statement in which he confessed to cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service in front of colleagues of the Romanian writers Richard Wagner, William Totok, Frans Hodjak and Helmut Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the attendees, Söllner won the German Language Award in 1989.
Attempts to recruit began unnoticed, not until 1971.
I am, continued Söllner, "then someone who has not defended himself sufficiently from attempted intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Hert Müller and its unprecedented literary dealing with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government is the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, shocked by the case of politicization, which marks the political, and the control of the soul.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the state of knowledge to date, only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In the Securitate acts, secret agent Walter played some role, said after Söllner’s confession Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of secret agent Walter on himself.
"He was cutting me off at all the important points for him," Markel says.
It has a moral obligation to make this statement.
Söllner’s statement was unexpected in this form and in front of this audience, but there is no surprising confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian Secret Service.
Herta Müller wrote in July, when she read her own records, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for spicy Securitate.
The impact, it is assumed, will be speculated and, in some cases, probably know which name is hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and precisely Walter.
Unlike in the domestic, in the meantime very certain inspection of the components of the Stage, the manipulation with the remainder of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic lighting has been marginalized and limited.
One of Birthler’s offices, responsible for the National Council for the Processing of Securitate (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the issuance of the act has been rather lengthy since then.
It is only since 2005 that there has been a law governing the management of components.
That the former members of the Securitate still have a great influence in Romania, according to an interview by one of the former Securitate chiefs of Temesvár, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller, he said that he was the recipient of the award.
She has psychosis, after all, she was interrogated only once.
The submersion of power was expressed here completely uncovered in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, as in the case of Söllner, as in the case of the silent accusation, there are inevitable questions.
The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession suggests that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than the assignment of guilt and guilt.
To the genesis of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a note under the hood.
Saturated deposit of the Champions League
It seemed as if a purely dressed business representative from a cute Christmas party, at which the manufacturer of sports goods of sweetness, when he performed a quarter of an hour after midnight in the summoned C-class mercedes, was coming.
A man with a distinctive coat of arms was allowed to drive after him to a foreign city.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and the drunk luck was a 55-year-old man too little.
It's been a nice night, but we're going to keep working tomorrow.
Or it's just beginning.
The words of the committed Swiss for only three days: "While we have reached the eighth final" in the Champions League with a 3:1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "we must not let ourselves be blinded by success: it will be a brutally tough fight against the fall."
"A far more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance from the royal class in Mohu<0xC4><0x8D>i even in the regular league days.
And avoid repeated obvious flaws after three quick goals by Maricia (5th), Träsche (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Destination
The Champions League octave finals (release 16/17 <0x2B> 23/24 February/revenge game 9/10 <0x2B> 16/17 March) will be played in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of Babbel’s successor’s tremor will thus be preserved.
Not only for a suspected therapist, who gave uncertain Stuttgart professionals confidence, willingness to deploy and enjoyment of the game in a short period of time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and I urged them to be more courageous, explained psychiatrist Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, which, with the help of the therapist Babbel, proved no longer effective.
Along the way, Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann said, "When a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't think possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a weeks of break due to injury, became the best player on the pitch due to his dynamics, tried to describe the detected "phenomena" by the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working practices of the new superior.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Obviously, it was missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart hasn't been saved yet, sports president Horst Heldt warns
But the VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened substitute and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would also win in Glasgow before a ugly wake-up call came after a 0:4 defeat in Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sports president Horst Heldt recalled that while one goal was achieved in the season, the other is still a long way off.
We're not over the water yet.
The fact that Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday, even after his first home win in three months, was caused by weekend events that had recently come to life in the form of a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the game began.
They are decisions that act differently than Jens, Heldt responded to Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He overcame the board of weak leadership and decided to change the coach after the pressure of pubertal fans.
Even the fact that he was cancelled his free day after the matches, Lehmann noted as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmann’s statements “formulate pure egoism,” Heldt replied, announcing the consequences for the porters.
Both the forty-nine will probably no longer have any joy in life.
In any case, they agree with each other that without the work of a busy coaching team, it would not be possible to have such a playful and combative performance.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of success," Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously - and the man with the gelit bag agrees.
World Heavyweight Championship matches
Passionate Duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of world champion Vitalia Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavyweight boxing organization WBC.
The decision of the arbitrators was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitalij Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko remains world champion in heavyweight boxing.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
This is the third successful title defense for Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice the World Champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it did not go to the O.K. everyone expected.
Klikko improved his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional matches, twice defeated due to injury.
Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th round.
Approximately 17,000 spectators in the Berne arena led the 2.02-metre tall Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko fight primarily with his left hand.
Eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced the end of Klitko's era before the duel, but withdrew from the world champion's strikes, so Klitko could not set a decisive blow with his dangerous right-hander.
All in all, passive Johnson did quite a bit on the challenger and only tried to get into the next round.
Although Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka provoked words and gestures, his hits were rarely hit by the world champion.
However, it is only the second boxer after Tim Hoffmann in 2000, who fought 12 rounds with Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
The challenger took care of the riots in the Swiss capital before the fighting.
He insulted Klick as a "resistant zombie" who "nothing knows right."
During the weighing on Friday, the champion was provoked, removing sunglasses from Johnson’s nose, “so he could see his eyes.”
Fourth victory after Klitkov's return
Klikko remained unsuccessful even after his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008.
After a nearly four-year break in Berlin, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter and took back his WBC belt, which he had to surrender without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
In this fight, I only got one wound and physically I was in good shape, justified Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimír is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt is worn by Brit David Haye after sitting from the throne in November, 2.13 metres tall Nikolai Vulaev.
Haye denied the fight against Kli<0xC4><0x8D>kov in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
His promotional company is reportedly planning a fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Front attack from the opposition: Green faction chief Jürgen Trittin has labeled Guttenberg’s defense minister as a liar because of misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Levice) call on the Chancellor to give an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings about the attack on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed conscious fraud.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two tanks in September was “consciously false,” Greens’ leader Jürgen Trittin told ARD’s “Tagesschau” Saturday.
Let’s call it a common term: Lie.
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not just about the destruction of the trucks kidnapped, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The U.S. attack, which was demanded by German commander Kunduz Colonel Klein, killed or wounded up to 142 people, according to NATO investigations.
The Greens, SPD and Linke called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to immediately speak before the Federal Parliament and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Merkel must explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the federal parliament’s policy – and if the Chancellor’s Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and colleagues from the Greens called for Renate Künate.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected criticism.
The Chancellor’s office has no influence on the concrete deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also loud doubts about the Ministry’s outline of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenbergs correctly and completely informed about the background of the attack on the tanks.
Officially, they were supposed to deny the existence of NATO reports and silence the minister’s sensitive details.
However, from the surroundings of the two senior officials, it appeared that they even pointed to several reports from the Ministry of Defence, including a bipartisan document from Colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reported that Wichert had in the meantime requested in a letter clarifying the situation.
It is noted that he has not received any response yet.
The ministry did not comment on the protests on Saturday and pointed out that this will be resolved in the Federal Parliament's inquiry committee, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in the awake state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only mentally ill or in drug addiction that the boundaries between imagination and reality come together.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we can be surrounded by the wildest imaginations and fantasy delusions.
But those who live in a state of sleepfulness, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in today’s western world, are often considered crazy or drug-dependent, or at least as strange.
However, such images and voices do not occur only in the mentally ill or in drug addiction.
The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, here and there will make sure that the boundaries between dream, imagination and reality are intertwined.
Dreams altered state of consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, at best we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may differ, however, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New-Age prophet Carlos Castanedy, shaman states of blushing, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of neuronal brain transmitters - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is broken.
Complex hallucinations and misleading thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The connection between blindness and dream has been employed by philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 "a great resemblance of blurring with dream states", for Sigmund Freud was even a dream of "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, claustrophobia".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and screamingly colorful.
Gravity has no power over it, it rises on the ceiling of the room.
He feels cramped.
Behind him, winged fucking figures with bloody red grimaces, cherishing teeth.
He chases him, digs into him with heavy, fire boots, throws him against the wall, feels pain all over his body.
Noisy, bad voices threaten from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer tolerate the voices he is insulting and insulting.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, attaches them to the loop and fastens it to the hook on the ceiling.
He'll stick to one speaker and put the rope around his neck.
Jumping.
The loop allows.
Learn, screaming in the choir's voices, tearing his drums, "Go to the clinic and let him be treated!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was released.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manioc-depressant, takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fears and deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
Approximately one percent of people suffer from schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime, and in psychiatric clinics it is the second most frequently treated disease after depression.
With acute schizophrenic psychosis, the sufferers can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they get into an aroused state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions, or the illusion of persecution.
The hearing of voices - voices that command, comment, or lead dialogues is particularly widespread.
Even optical hallucinations are not unusual.
Affected is not able to distinguish important from insignificant, the brain cannot filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens up a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the Clinic of General Psychiatry of the University Clinic of Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located at the center of the event, everything has meaning directed at it.
At the same time, it gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overpowered by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparing them with reality is usually not possible, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
To experience hallucinations once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchss says, "but the sensory and spatial structure of reality that a person perceives in psychosis remains essentially preserved."
False thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the detachment of the experience takes place in the real world.
Scientists are still wondering why our brains are doing such things.
“Exceptional conditions can lead any person to lose their relationship with reality in the short term,” Fuchs says.
Not everyone develops into psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists believe that people with disabilities have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stages of development there will be damage to the neural maturation of the brain, for example, by a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
However, it remains a conjecture as to how the neural system will break down, which hasn’t developed in many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis if there is a disposition to it.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain shuts down
It’s crazy that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others donate money for drugs to get them, says Erich Kasten, a professor of psychology in Lübeck.
Whether we perceive overlaps as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he interpreted his findings in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf".
Although hallucinations are one of the typical accompaniment phenomena of psychosis, they are also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, scattered sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, it also hallucinates the brain of a healthy person under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or little suppressed; if our brain is blocked, or when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also take away stimuli, stress, anxiety with love or other exceptional states.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents said they had experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attending a gymnasium there.
Actually, she's a completely normal girl.
If there weren't those pictures and voices.
On breaks, it can happen that she is asked to roll with long, dark hair.
When they answer, the companions look at her with surprise - no one except her can see and hear this boy.
This daring girl is considered a dream come true, but Sarah K. does not, she knows.
He is up, he hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, the boy likes it.
Am I crazy? he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other tricks are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are more conspicuous
There are often overloads.
When she sits in class, she can’t watch the lesson many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears represents a new comrade, but he explains it to all the others in a table of mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are more conspicuous.
When he waits in his dark room for a sleep that comes rarely and too late, he can often not distinguish whether he is awake or asleep, whether the pictures he sees are grimaces, or a girl with bleeding wounds on his hands or legs.
Leave me alone, yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations stopped a year ago.
Since contacting psychologist Kasten on the internet, she knows exactly that she hasn't gone crazy.
Delusions are also an art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or is taken away from their stimuli, they are likely to have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I think the brain doesn't have enough work to do and take care of its own fun.
Sarah K., an only child, had a fear of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that a man named Dad hasn’t been her own father since he thought of her.
Because with visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same areas of the brain that also process real sounds and sounds are active, it is difficult for the affected like Sarah K. to distinguish from each other delusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "the reality takes place in the real world, the story takes place there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain come into being, which is why they work so realistic.”
Kasten also evaluates nightmares as a form of hallucination.
The hallucination of healthy people is not fundamentally different from hallucination in acute psychosis.
Contrary to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The boundary between sleep and hallucinations
In our world too focused on consciousness, the imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and head of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic at Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also brings positives, creativity - diarrhea is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of changed consciousness to dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the affected person considers real and cannot even distinguish them back from the awake state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience full-conscious motor damage.
When a person is at risk of losing the world and himself, such as permanent, complete inability to move, he replaces life-threatening real-life situations with his own imaginary world, which is separated from reality.
Type of border state between sleep and hallucination.
Because in reality it is not possible to handle a situation, there will be a change in the worlds, but the real situation will be present in the imagination.
Intensive form of support of the senses and the transfer of the senses into some unbearable situation, which allows people their own ability to form, to transition within a moment into a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memories.
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a savior of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after a cardiac surgeon with a subsequent heart transplant, his consciousness went on a several days' journey, his body lying immobilely on the intensive care unit.
Claussen immerses himself in the world he created, visiting other times and places: He becomes an old man lying on his bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility, which produces odorous substances from the blood.
On a motorcycle, he is taken by Greece to his homeland, on a hospital bed, he surfs on a pine tree in the Alps, and meets a Korean mafia.
It is completely immersed in the imaginary, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
A dream is a different state, describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories from those mental journeys are clearly clear for years and in unsubstantiated details.
Even brighter and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug addiction show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in the awake state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten summarizes, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
The new editorial director of Kallen is a transitional solution: Hubert Burda wants to hand his business over to his two children for a long time, he told SPIEGEL.
In the future, the company will be 100 percent owned by the family.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda has long seen his business in the hands of his children.
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are determined to enter the company, says a 69-year-old man named SPIEGEL.
The details were carefully dealt with.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is only then asked.
The question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to place 7,500 employees in front of their children if they are not capable enough.
It would kill both kids and business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had resigned from the presidency since January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
Kallen, 52, has been a board member at Burdy since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
After Jürgen Todenhöfer’s resignation, Direct Marketing, Foreign Affairs, Press and Finance was added to the Treasury.
For the first time, none of the family members are in charge of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves to “curse 10, 15 years,” Burda said.
Holdings should be 100 percent family-owned in the future, Burda says.
With regard to the Schickendanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses have no certainty before disappearance: "It has always affected companies that have been infected with the desire for capital that they speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
“He never dreamed of world power,” Burda says.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with Time, these deals are too big.
Comprehensive beauty care
Everything you can want in the area of beauty and well-being, you have at your fingertips.
This was suggested by El Corte Inglés, which has just launched the Callao shopping center (Madrid) of more than 1000 m2, which provides a wide range of body care services.
The wellness department is located on the eighth floor, where are located such prestigious companies as Hedonai dealing with laser depilation-; Spaxion, relaxation and aesthetic procedures; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or with gym or L'Occitane offering.

Various listenings
Christmas is approaching and this is the time when it is appropriate to find out what celebrities are wearing, and adapt to it even your festive wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the character, which is necessary to keep in mind.
Let's make a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. We do not recommend.
Endesa in Barcelona, with an electric car
The energy company Endesa together with the Barcelona City Council founded the 'LIVE Chancellor'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the capital of Catalonia.
The Office LIVE' (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will establish and guide a roadmap for the introduction of electric cars in the city and ensure agreements in the field of mobility, will manage, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this vehicle of the future.
3 'Electrical Cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city involved in the project to introduce electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will also join the project.
These are the three cities that the government has chosen as part of the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support activities in the field of research and technological development in the Catalan autonomous region.
This also includes activities related to energy and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa in the promotion of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively implements a number of additional projects, e.g. G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'climbing period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the country's main export sector, is awaiting a "clean period".
Zapatero summarizes the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector in the 2009 financial report.
“Without a competitive plan for the automotive sector, we would be left to the brink of abandonment today, the closure of some of our major manufacturing companies,” the Prime Minister said.
"Thanks to this plan and the desire of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm is expected in the future for this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he pointed out that the competitive plan, which is part of the Integral Automotive Plan (PIA), has allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiaries, which mobilised an investment of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed the governmental measures to support the request and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is being implemented in cooperation with the autonomous regions and automotive brands.
According to the president, the plan allowed to reduce the average emission level of new vehicles sold in the Spanish market by 6%, and ensured a "significant increase" in registrations, specifically in November by "40 percent".
20,000 square meters of classical vehicles
The first International Classic Vehicle Salon will open in Madrid, a space for meeting both professionals and amateurs from the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, on which more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but also products of all kinds related to the world of motorcycles in ClassicAuto Madrid.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real treats for collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be: Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renovation; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and renovation of cars; or Cochera Clásicos, specialized company Mercedes Benz.
Skill tests in the outdoors
In addition, the commercial activities of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: conducting concentrations, sports performances, fitness tests, presentations and bankruptcies.
Qualification tests will also be carried out for classic cars and motorcycles in a customized circuit outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Preserving Sports Style
Mazda intends to show that the eco-friendly environment has no negative impact on the sporting style.
And that’s why Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system – also known as Kai-Stop – which is a device that is currently available only with a 2.0 150 horsepower gasoline engine.
This second-generation Mazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics it has achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behavior, mechanics, system i-Stop...
All of these aspects are excellent at Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver’s seat, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely delicate.
Using a set of tools and consoles, we will conclude that Mazda is continuing the Japanese trend in the development of a futuristic design with many buttons and controllers and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style reminds us in part of the style that also presents the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the agility of German products and more specifically with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention a large luggage space and regular shapes.
The automatic stop-and-start system is currently only available with a two-liter petrol engine and 150 horsepower six-speed manual gearbox.
This engine is a real sweetness. It is very delicate, it is characterized by a reduced noise level, its power and lower consumption.
Although the most sought after Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive so many kilometers a year should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced consumption.
As for the equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the case of serial equipment, it is necessary to mention in particular the track tracking system (RVM), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, tensile and stability control, speed control, an internal mirror sensitive to the light, a climate-sensitive 17th, an on-board computer, a broom and a steamer, and a large screen.
And if the equipment wasn’t enough, this version was equipped with the Pack Premium, for an additional 1,500 euros: adaptive lights dual-tone and BOSE sound system with CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is characterized primarily by the quality of the materials used, its operation and the high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not drive more kilometers per year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is only with a petrol engine2.0 and 150 horsepower.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.770 for Luxury and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23.270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Première'
L.A. has a red carpet, delicate as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have shined more than ever in the new stylish and sexy models of 'Nine'. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'ladies'.
Slib FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, only used to browse mail, without the ability to browse a certain type of attachments or surf the web.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine ranked it as one of the products of the year.
It’s harder to see it outside, but that idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount paid for, for example, an iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one is exclusively for Twitter, the other is based on a permanently provided free data service, which, however, needs to be paid for Peek six times the amount.
FonPeek, introduced yesterday at Le Web, is the European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It is limited as well as its American counterpart, but brings a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
Passengers with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or impatiently look for a café with WiFi (or Fon connection) so they can view mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, a person would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read a thumbnail.
The European Commission is constantly demanding to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are accessible across Europe, which still has no side effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it’s interesting that it still has a name for Fon when it doesn’t have WiFi) achieves this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and considering different offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and payable when buying, not after months.
And that’s exactly what I expect to happen once in the case of FonPeek, it’s an option to buy with a permanent approach as the Peek has already introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from the point of view of the consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The colors that Michelle loves
Yellow is undoubtedly the first lady’s favorite color.
For Barack Obama’s inauguration as President of the United States, she chose a dress and a coat in this color, the same color she also chose when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with flashing effects-, in both cases it was a three-piece set - dress, bag and coat of the same fabric- decorated with a large design or a large decoration.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to go in the footsteps of the Assyrian princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothing is made makes both models significantly different.
On the occasion of Michelle's entry into office, she used a large lace, in Oslo, with a samlet with a print.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with a medium-high heel, now similar to the model, but in golden color.
He also wears a variety of hairstyles: this timethorn, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have maternity-related work problems.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger age who are planning to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and career of Spanish women', carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study involved 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market due to maternity.
The study emphasizes that at the beginning of partner coexistence there are many differences in opinions on the number of children depending on whether they are working or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with a partner earlier, have their first child earlier, and overall have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, postpone partnerships and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with a stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years since the start of coexistence with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have spent most of their lives achieving a stable job and therefore had to postpone their coexistence and their future.
This type of profession also has a strong impact on maternity, although it has a smaller impact on the start of coexistence with a partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, researcher at CSIC.
Another factor influencing the age of women at the time of marriage is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at age 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
“There is yet another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education marry and give birth to their first child even before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education prefer to get a stable job, rather than marriage and the birth of the first child.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of directors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I'm Worth It'.
The actress 'Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l', one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, adds herself to other famous L'Oréal Paris figures such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Even before she joined this club, actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Millionaire of the Cottage").
The men's part of this cosmetics brand is also represented by prominent figures: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most prominent representatives – designers and modelers, formerly and presently – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London, at the Royal Court axes of Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was selected as the best model of the year.
Manuela Vicenta
Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-rays of the writers he encountered in his literary life (and in some cases in ordinary life) in 'Eso Poker' (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente).
It does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but it seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vicent spares no relief or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader’s pleasure, even with repeated reading.
Here are some comments.
On the pages of this book, I discovered that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as I feel, but it cannot be called: the pleasure of an anti-acid, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.
About Samuel Beckett: "The Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between impotence and ignorance, with a blinding poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were a knife knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been passionate about this woman for thirteen years, isolation, delight, and purity, which is a spiritual privilege to reach heaven by the way of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand peaks in universal literature that must be overcome from the north side, from which the best hikers often fall apart."
William Faulkner: “He was a strange man.
He said of himself that he was the heir to the landlord from the county, and that he was once again the son of a black man with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a huge dream.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge the confused cry of this man from Munich to bring his voice into the night of the twentieth century in his literary form, running away from himself and calling for the future and loudly speaking."
About Dorothy Parker: "One fell down and prayed, 'My dear God, let me stop writing like a woman.'
On Joseph Conrad's tomb, Spencer's verse reads, "After the effort comes a dream, after the storm a quiet harbour, after the war a rest, after the full life of death."
About Virginia Wolf: “In his luggage he also took his depression.
His husband fully agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
“No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness.”
About Pío Baroja: "What else was it for Martin Santos to focus Joyce on Baroja?
What else was it for Bennett to let Baroj execute Faulkner's weapon?
What was the matter with Cel other than to become famous at the expense of that man’s glory?”
Cowardly aggression
Last week my 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood, in Fuenlabrada district, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by the collar and our dog, a crossover saved from a shelter weighing no more than six kilograms, without a single word of a word, and twice.
Our anger is all the more that we see nothing fun in such aggression against a small, defenseless animal that was on the lead.
And in addition, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she clashed with these individuals on the walk, began to worry about her own safety, because such a devil-obsessed man, who attacks an animal, is able to do the same thing to a woman, a child, a man, an old man, or a woman.
It happened at five o’clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The landscape has been splashing all day.
We have, of course, lodged a complaint with the nearest Commissioner, but we doubt that it was for something, and in order not to raise gruesome questions, we find that these cowardly killers were of Spanish nationality.
The anger has forced us to announce this fact.
We don’t understand what happens to today’s youth when they are enjoying the pain of a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We don’t understand where the right breeding, respect for animals and people has been shared.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both parties have informed today.
The aim of this initiative is to emphasize the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only means to prevent head injuries and even deaths in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin stated that this campaign is part of its traffic safety commitments, which "means more than designing and producing even safer products", and confirmed that it is attempting to fulfill this purpose in other ways, i.e. in the form of instructional and campaign information.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets when riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase in which more than 500 repaired motorcycles will be deployed to raise awareness among the general public.
In conclusion, Michelin pointed out that traffic safety "is a constant problem" of the company, which is the manufacturer of two-wheel tyres and whose main goal is to constantly increase the safety of its products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are on the rise
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to reminisce.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represented an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, moreover, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to figures of the patronage organization of Anfac producers and sellers Ga.
However, the positive figure is better to quarantine, as November 2008 is a considerably poor period for comparison and represented a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling within the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick-ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/cars.
Even the clouds that are most detrimental to demand have not disappeared, even though they were purchased by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by small and medium-sized companies and in 100% of cases it is financing through third parties.
Restrictions arising from the closure of the source of bank loans need to be added to other factors such as the cessation of operations or the continuation of a bad economic situation.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the support for the purchase of 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention those who are on a business card of small and medium-sized companies who are planning to buy a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with CO2 emissions of not more than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
It was just yesterday that they reminded again that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Sellers’ Association estimates that in 2010, development will be similar to last year and sales for passenger cars will fall by 19%, according to estimates.
The auxiliary system on the manual brake is already mandatory.
As in the case of the ABS anti-blocking system, this will be the case with ESP stability control,hand-brake assistive systems, all this will become a mandatory equipment for European vehicles.
In fact, they are already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while others have a deadline for eliminating the deficiency, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase pedestrian protection, working in a way that can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary manual brake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system detects when the driver is down.
But it can’t always keep this pressure up to the end.
According to a study by car parts manufacturer Bosch, one-third of the drivers who had an accident did not hit the brakes before the crash and half of them did not fully use the brake power.
Up to 1,100 accidents
This assistance, on the other hand, requires a maximum from the braking system, shortens the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related fatal accidents could be prevented annually.
Reducing this number will be even more significant-according to calculations would avoid one in four accidents with an impact on people-after the introduction of so-called intelligent handbrake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (with the help of a radar or camera) detects obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will operate as intensively as possible on the brakes and minimise the risk of damage.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April – probably April 8 – as Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer will be alerting the time, warns
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to make every point of the plan first agree with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will be presented first to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, may be issued at the beginning of 2010.
GM, on the other hand, ensures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken in these days.
No wonder the Swedish government has increased pressure on the U.S. producer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM enables contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of the Dutch sports carmaker Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian Converg group.
If it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to Baic in China.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is still valid if its sale fails.
Driving with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this splendid model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1,275 kg.
Based on the first of all, the automatic pull-out roof is made in canvas with manual control, thereby reducing the weight by 21 kg; further aluminum doors were used, such as the GT3, which means a further 15 kg, less; the removal of the air-conditioning parts by 13 kg.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
Also offered with a two-speed PDK gearbox, one vehicle with manually ranging six-speed gearbox, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many intricate gears, has been tested.
His behavior can only be qualified as untouchable.
Reducing the weight does not mean that the vehicle will not be pushed to the asphalt.
Rather the opposite: we have not tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time, which at the same time would carry such safety when moving in a gearbox, even at high speeds.
It is a small athlete capable of warming the muscles while driving for a short period of time until we order him a sprint, braking, and restoring the use of the engine.
Whatever we want, thanks to a steering system that is as communicative as it is accurate, whatever we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do it with surgical precision.
The sound of the engine according to the will
The sound of the V6 boxer, about 320 horsepower (about 10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be reinforced by 'sport' options and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recovery.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt roads we're going through with the Boxster Spyder were quite damaged, but the car handled the pulls well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and at some turns we encountered the dawn on the ice and gravel even in the advanced morning.
Definitely this ultralight car is one of the most fun on the market, as it’s a little more than just a Boxster S modification.
The car will be on sale in February 2010 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70.831.
"Bag Girl"
Karl Lagerfeld's girlfriend, the icon of the Coco Cocoon series and the occasional 'starlette' on the company's tours, the singer shows her face as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins in Israel
She won a brilliant victory in 82-91 during her stay at the complicated Maccabi Electra playground, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus she became the leader of her group after the big performance of Mirza Teletovice (a team of eight points in three).
The Society of Vitoria was able to replace a significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micah with a large dose of dedication and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end to win.
In addition, the high precision of the 16-point triangle circle contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The game started in front of the blues, who stood on the mark from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance already indicated that they attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alavan team decided to play the inner game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was accepted by sandblasting and applause upon returning to his original position to increase the advantage before the break began (34-43).
Teletovic had already started to be the best in his team with 13 points, although 'without six' in Splitter's rating already indicated that it would not be the best evening for the Brazilians.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the slightest and the Macabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their playground, and 'Elie's hand was able to win.
Eidson and Pnini have definitely contributed to the 'yellow' return to expulsion (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, wounded, but not dead at all, needed a few precise games to breathe, and then appeared Mirza Teletovic, who with three three almost consecutive and with the help of English and Ribase returned the score to a soothing number of horses (54-67).
The Alavscis had their skin in the last part, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) had already announced that they would not allow anyone to prepare them for the deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this and the splitter excluded for failing Ivanovic did not hurry and defended well, and although the Israelis were approaching the final minute (80–85), the game had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja significantly lost in Greece with Olympiacos and left him the lead of Group B in Euroleague in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy Society did not rely on the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship nor on its rival, perhaps one of the sickest in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three third points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, brightened the playground s12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity ofUnica, although the local arsenal in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both.
The Greek team began to work and proved its dominance in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaj team
Between the internal players and Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with three points, they increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible revenge
The third part was very offensive by Olympiacos, who, despite losing 19, proved to be dominant and even managed to make up the difference from the Malaga 66-48 game of Malaga, minute 27, which shocked the group lead.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the drawbacks, Unicaja, thanks to the lead and three points, Cook and Lewis's profits, left a certain hope of a 66-57 win, a minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because the Olympiacos, thanks to the reinforcement and prevalence in centimeters in their zone, proved to be unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to level the basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja lost and handed the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you collect for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, search engines with the largest number of classified ads in real estate, jobs and motor vehicles in Spain.
The tool How Much Should You Take? calculates the salary of users based on more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using the form available on Facebook, where you need to deposit a profession, years of experience, age and city where you are interested.
During the week that the app works, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally “feels badly paid,” explains Albert Rivera responsible for the Trovit product in his report.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the worst payouts.
The British programmer takes <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,226 gross annually and the French takes <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31,059, while the Spanish receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>24,000.
Similarly, the driver is paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>34,247 net annually in England, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,751 in France and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, in Spain the work of a waiter is the worst-paid with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by a seller with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought after jobs on the network in the last three months are a driver, a half-time job and a social worker.
Brazil has set a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed President must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, the Brazilian embassy’s chief businessman in Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that Mel knows he has to leave the embassy, where he has been hiding since September 21.
He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek refuge in another country.”
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: “I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said by phone.
After the election on November 29 (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to get asylum in Brazil.
The operation was eventually lost because Zelaya refused the political asylum condition, which was attempted by the de facto government of President Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty emerged again in the markets, which should not be surprising, as it is already a natural state in an environment where the negotiators are taking decisions about the future.
The drug used by central banks to stabilize the market was the direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity at a near-zero rate so that financial institutions could purchase assets to be disposed of.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have practically ended, and without questioning their unconventional liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a little bit of sand into the limelight, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors are therefore in doubt about the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures, and we will be involved in the return of reducing risky returns.
The exchange’s mobility and bond differences have regained points, although they are still very distant from the abnormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which once again affected public debt.
The pressure on quality is again being put on, and the United States, Japan and Germany have become the refuge of selected investors, expanding the differentiation of the eurozone countries towards Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this instability, but at the time came Standard & Poor's and threatened a new revision of the Spanish Kingdom's qualifications declining.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty is not useless to silence moral risk advocates who have once again tried to burden the conscience of those responsible for world economic policy because of the slowing down of the destructive consequences of restricting the loan to employment, if the day-to-day employment would actually fail.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between emirates for the restoration of power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen it before.
A government that covers the deficit, elections, and a new government is coming.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barros.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-performing foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro member countries to fail to meet their commitments.
What makes sense, however, is for Ecofin to force the Greek government to have transparency and the commitment of its own citizens to be jointly accountable when urgent measures are needed to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of a period of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses on supported positions would be within the scope of expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our disparities in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If the European disparities were to be reduced and ours further expanded, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The issue of Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most of the services of studies to pre-empt their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 escalation scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the japanese scenario on the scale of the economy.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "carefully, fellow drivers".

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first speaker to speak before the House’s subcommittee yesterday, where he is discussing Spain’s energy strategy over the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the speech of President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasecy, Galán made several comments to the press on the proposal he submitted to the Subcommittee at closed doors.
According to President Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 million by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion by 2030 if nuclear power plants are maintained that are currently in operation.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change and there will be a need to increase performance.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it is believed that a new 18,000 MW is needed, however, with other "subsidy energies".
Galán, who believes the women's draft of the Sustainable Economy Act, which has just been approved by the government, corresponds to the line that the company demanded, did not want to give up living as a royal decree to promote national coal consumption, which opposes a policy of combating climate change.
In his view, "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite "precise" measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
Whatever it is, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must begin to be taken now, because their maturity is ongoing and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' Aer Lingus at 10 airports
The subsidiary of the airport ground service company Ferrovial, the Swiss company Swissport, will play the role of the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, from which the economic deadlines have not yet expired, has a validity of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol on cooperation to establish the Centre for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructure
The association expects an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% belongs to Ferrovial.
One of the centre’s tasks will be to research energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession on a motorway in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy and water business.
The building in question is an estimated 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a construction and concession road business.
City Council wants to have tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP) for further development of the project in the business plan enshrined by Ernst & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the fee.
The tenders are expected to be submitted in May, with an estimated investment of 1,700 million Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the final phase of competitions three companies with a significant presence in European buildings.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the second, headquartered in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground construction.
Northern Direct is in the game against the Acciona Group with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group to cross the network is called LBRJV and is part of the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, here represented by ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (owned by the civil company Rauzer and the German Rauzer special group Bi.
The Australian infrastructure market promises big constructions and privatization, but brings with it a clear difficulty of entry in a different way than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy guided by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for Spanish giants in the sector, in addition to Asian references.
ACS acquired a market share through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted Leighton.
Million Assets
Acciona is committed to the geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier activities and in the sewerage trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that build and operate a refueling facility in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and to use joint energy to enter the areas of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground route, which is promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office, called the Northern Link, is intended to connect the western highway from Toowong with the circular route in Kelvin Grove (see map) over a 5-kilometre length of the tunnel.
The calendar set by the local government is scheduled for the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid transit would open in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is planned for 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic tariff system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers this deal Hochtief
Australia continues to bring a significant profit to Hochtief as it announced a contract with the government estimated at <0x24>154 million yesterday.
The participating ACS will operate the national broadband network infrastructure with a fiber optic cable through its local Leighton branch.
This situation will allow quick access to the Internet for 400,000 people and provide employment to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the construction project of the tower of King George on 27 floors in Brisbane, Australia. Construction work was only to begin and Hochtief closed sales for <0x24>129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, Laing O'Rourke will be involved in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC assigned a tunnel in Slovenia for <0x24>64 million
Through its Alpine branch, the FCC has been awarded a 2.1-kilometre tunnel construction for the Slovene highway worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million.
The company got the contract several days after the work on the extension of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
Work is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got an advertisement in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services for the last two years to Mrs. Rushmore for approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 million a year, the company informed the railway operator.
The contract includes the possibility of a 12-month extension each year. Mrs. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that presented themselves in the contest drafted by Renfe, of which four moved to the final, including TBWA, which was responsible for the creation of ad tracking t
From this moment on, Mrs. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of the campaign.
France Télécom fined <0x24>63 million for obstructing competition
The French Competition Regulatory Authority imposed a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the country’s Caribbean.
According to this institution, the operator has restricted the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and consumer loyalty programs on the edge of regulation.
With these sanctions, the former French monopoly and the still state company has collected more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles on its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the Competition Supervisory Authority considers that France Télécom has committed a similar infringement as in the past and that there has therefore been a recurrence.
Shop with apps
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened an online app store in order to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the start, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries such as Spain.
Playing in the Champions League brought 476.4 million to Madrid and Barce from the start
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its founding in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made <0x24>476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The list is hosted by Manchester United.
The list is hosted by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition has divided <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million among 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since the tournament was established in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out very well from this division.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money he earned for participation, and the only one along with AC Milan to win three times the main prize.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the disappeared European Cup in 1992 is fifth in the rankings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two of the teams that made the most money for participating in the previous Champions League.
And yet she lost both of them to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country to win the most money through the Champions, although it has won the most titles out of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribute
This seeming paradox is explained by the complex procedure of allocating the money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the agency, chaired by Michel Platini, plans to earn 1,090 million for the Champions League.
With this money, UEFA spends <0x24>413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary qualifying round (including Atlético Madrid) received <0x24>2.1 million.
In addition, the participants received only 3.8 million for their attendance, in addition to an additional 550,000 euros for each match in which they participated.
There is also a prize for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and a draw (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 for each team). Eight finalists get three million each; eight quarterfinalists 3.3 million.
Each of the last four will receive <0x24>4 million.
The champion earns <0x24>9 million, while the second finalist earns <0x24>5.2 million.
Thus, on fixed payments, the club earns at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments, for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is divided according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones and has four assigned places.
Last year's champion will receive 40% of allocated money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will be played this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>61 million for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday announced details of the offer to buy shares, with the help of which it wants to gain a top spot between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
This percentage is not bound to make a public tender for the acquisition (optional) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5025 per share that it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest on this postponement of 1% per year.
Yesterday Sos stocks ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa ranks the company by 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of the Sos.
The bid is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day period for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase was made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, the sauce changes the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to stay on the edge of possible bids to buy and settle the judicial fluctuations of his former leaders, the brothers of Jesus and Jaime Salazar, it was announced the appointment of Maria Luisa Jorda as Head of Internal Audit.
This decision makes her the first woman to occupy a high position in the food business.
It is a newly created place that will be subject directly to the chairman of the group.
And it is not excluded from the controversy, as the company is still immersed in a legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos by the Salazar brothers.
In fact, the possibility that Sos will reveal new funds in the coming months cannot be scarred.
With regard to Salazar’s credit, former members of the Council Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) said yesterday before the National Court that they had approved the transfer of <0x24>212 million without knowing where their destination was.
CNMV authorises the exclusion options of Paternina, which participated in Inversor Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday approved exclusion, with Inversor Mer participating, against Federica Paternino on October 9.
The Supervisory Authority explained that it authorised this operation because it understands that its conditions are in accordance with the applicable standards and considers that it is "sufficient" the content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
CNMV stated that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the company’s capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares accepted for trading on the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were cancelled, which could not be transferred in any way until the tender was closed, which he specified that the price was set by Federica Paternina according to the provisions of the applicable standards.
New Vehicle Assessment Tools
These days, storms and accidents don’t just make money from cars.
Every day, thousands of cars suffering from an insurance incident are taken to the service, where the expert has to estimate the damages and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of parts and the time of the workforce can be long and complex work.
Calculating manual repair costs from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and workforce can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
That’s why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of services and solutions for the estimation of insurance events and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information that manufacturers provide them to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American group Solera is the leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of appraisal and sector information development tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, Sales Director of Audatex, there are 63 manufacturers and importers in Spain, each of whom provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to grow, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been listed in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
This is a very hot job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphics processing is carried out, where it is possible to "squeeze" individual parts of tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
When it comes to minority cars, it can take three or four months. Currently Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but not, for example, Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the fleet in circulation, it exceeds 99%.
Audatex has eight centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The National Headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work with three computer screens at the same time.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are ranked, and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this vast flow of information enables businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common use focuses on repair and maintenance, but there are also tools for controlling spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of the car according to the country.
The only company that has a guide available to inform about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex is not offered in our country, but in the United States.
With the products offered by Audatex, it’s easy to get the support that industry professionals can use.
The company offers ten different tools, with the star product AudaPlus, a standard insurance event award solution designed for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes time for repair estimated by the manufacturer or lacquer.
This tool is valid according to the use for each evaluation.
The maximum price is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5.75 for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of estimates, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment it came out of the assembly line only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to exclude vehicles with an overall insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations by brand or model.
For example, it is possible to study how many model brands have been serviced due to an accident or how many serious insurance events have occurred over a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also designed for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a service provider and solution for the assessment of damage, accident or car maintenance.
Gt Guía Assessment is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3,100 experts and 53 insurers.
The turnover has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of the Paris office installation began.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of her brother is born in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
Global invoicing by the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach <0x24>557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company will make 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on a <0x24>1 billion stock exchange, and now its shares are estimated at a total value of <0x24>2,400 million.
It has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and is included in the Standard & Poor's index.
Internet auction of damaged vehicles
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an online base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation predicted an allocation of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million from 85% of the company’s capital, which would expand by the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is exclusively handled by professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, leases, services, sale of spare parts and professional dealers who must register before the start of operations.
Established in 1996 in Germany, this platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 are in Germany.
Among the main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The Web currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been excluded cannot be returned to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be allowed to operate, although they have been excluded, after preliminary steering.
The budget of the service in four steps
With Auda-Taller, Audatex guarantees that the user will get the budget in only four steps: identifying the vehicle, finding a spare part, creating a budget for budget planning.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of senior professionals who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including 666, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer with an internet connection is required for use.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphical display of the model will appear and then the necessary spare part will be selected.
The user may include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then print and pass on to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an award-winning tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include an estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working to make this view three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanic welcomes, because it allows you to, for example, choose a door and turn it to show the inside.
