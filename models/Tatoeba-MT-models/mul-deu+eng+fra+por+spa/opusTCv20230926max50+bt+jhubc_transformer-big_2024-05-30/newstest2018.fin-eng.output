Camille Auer wanted to correct her sex, was diagnosed with a mental illness, and now she's doing art on the subject - "A man should have a right to his own body"
There are dozens of patient reports from the roof of the Project room gallery at the Academy of Fine Arts.
Every one of them reads Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outsiders have written up their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided who he is on his behalf.
“I wanted to tell you my personal history of treatment so that the violence of the process could be seen,” Auer said.
In the process, he refers to the process of gender correction.
It is often a years-long research period that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with the transmission of "gender identity disorder" diagnostic studies carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Prior to that, he had actually used the estrogen he ordered over the internet and was nevertheless very far behind in his own repair process.
She experienced being a woman, but according to the Finnish law, a person must undergo a repair process in order to be able to correct sex also legally.
Translaki, i.e. the transgender law on gender affirmation (563/2002) requires transgender people to be forced into sterilization in order to obtain the right sex, for example, to the population registry and passport.
At the moment, a psychiatric diagnosis and certificate of reproductive inability are required for every gender corrective authority.
A person has the right to decide on his own body.
“This situation is intolerable and violates human rights,” Auer said.
Translation reform has been talked about in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight legal remarks, and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to exercise their right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared the amendment under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovisen.
Elections were held and the Finns came to power.
Now the change of law is stuck again.
These are internal political disputes, which are not even related to this law.
“The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about amending the law,” said Frank Johansson, Managing Director of Amnesty Finland.
Two large installations control the front part of the exhibition space.
The second consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the psychologist of the Transpolin Hospital at the University of Tampere at Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report based on these, which should define Auer's treatment and assistance.
The awareness of the reality to be explored seems to be subject to deterioration.
The concept of oneself to be explored appears to be fragmented in a border-level way and the volatile personality traits are accentuated.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
“It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness,” Auer says.
What was even more shocking was that Auer was not given a gender correction treatment.
According to the nursing staff, his resources were insufficient to initiate the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and met Transpol for a TV show.
Later on that television was born a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
“It’s crazy that any person defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but to remove breasts requires a diagnosis,” Auer says.
Your body is not your own if you experience that you are different from the number of sex you are defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer’s experience is not the only one of its kind.
The process of genital mutilation is much more difficult for mental reasons than for purely medical surgeries.
Through it, they meet dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and their right to their own sex experience.
“It’s crazy that people in need of support and help are denied treatment by claiming that their resources are insufficient,” Auer says.
Many applicants for the process have psychiatric symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible experiences of bullying.
With these withdrawals, the nursing staff can prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
“Preventing treatment and getting help can lead to an even worse situation than it was before the process started,” Auer says.
Auer’s own exhibition also deals with anxiety and suicidal thoughts.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: "I've had self-destructive thoughts throughout my adult life and it's something that people usually find difficult to digest."
Depression has been treated with medication and when Auer started using hormones, feeling relieved.
He had finally been able to express feelings that had existed since childhood and adolescence.
It is why the wide slit did not seem to fit your own body and why the breast muscles should be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people close to him who can see him.
Being a star is a basic requirement.
“You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound, and moving,” she says.
Today, Auer is already seeing her coming, she exists as a woman.
However, at the beginning of the process, random comments from closest parties could have hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when your loved ones are sexually abused.
“They should know and they know who I am, but they won’t agree or be able to internalize it,” he continues.
However, not all transgender people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
Without the use of hormones and a long research process, however, you can’t get official confirmation for your own sex.
“There is no medical basis for these studies,” Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, Parliament adopted a new procedure for legal recognition of gender in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to the legal sex.
A full-time applicant submits a written application for a new ID stating that he or she is experiencing a different gender.
After six months of consideration, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall give the applicant a new ID.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland and this requirement is also crystallized by Auer’s exhibition.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I would like to believe that art is still of importance and that it can bring about political change in a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Rights Organization has issued a travel warning to Missouri.
The National NAACP for African American Citizens' Rights (NAACP) has issued a travel warning about Missouri because of the state's discriminatory practices and the racist attacks that have taken place there.
"NAACP's Missouri Travel Information comes into force on 28 August 2017, and it urges African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and to observe extreme caution when travelling in a state where information has recently been received," said the statement.
In Missouri, a law that has recently entered into force makes it difficult to legalize the export of cases of discrimination. Moreover, the implementation of state laws is disproportionately directed to minorities. According to NAACP, these factors led to the issue of travel warnings.
“People’s civil rights are violated.
They will be stopped by skin color and maltreated or killed,” NaaCP president Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of as many cases in just a short time."
The Missouri Travel Information is the organization’s first warning about the U.S. state.
The organization cited racist comments against African-American students at Missouri University as well as the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dubious circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the state when his car was out of fuel. Missouri police arrested him, even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel report also referred to a report by the Missouri Justice Minister that said the police were 75% more likely to arrest a black driver than a white driver.
“The purpose of the travel announcement is to urge people to be vigilant and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to prepare, for example, by taking money to pay the guarantees or telling relatives that they plan to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, in Missouri, in 2015, there were a hundred hate crimes, the 16th most recorded in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it difficult for businesses to challenge the discrimination in their right to live and work relationships.
The ACLU, a constitutional civil rights organization, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after it passed immigration laws that oblige police to detain people for immigration offences. According to the organization, this is more based on racial profiling.
In general, travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other countries, but recently they have been published by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair to report on the additional pension of the CEO
Minister of Commerce Mika Lintilä (centre) has asked Finnair for a report on the additional pension fee received by CEO Pekka Vauramo, says Yle.
According to the minister, it is contrary to the state’s will.
The additional pension of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>130,000 received by Vauramo emerged this week as Helsinki’s Sanomat reported on the development of the remuneration of the leaders of the stock exchange companies.
The Finnish newspaper Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo’s additional pension in February.
Finnair said it would give up additional pensions in 2013.
The government has ruled that no additional pensions will be used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finland.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year’s Principle Decision on Ownership Management.
Punishment immediately coerced
Some time ago, it seemed that the relations between the United States and Russia were on the way from cold to warm.
The meeting of US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg seemed to be going well with each other.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
Russia reacted viciously to the new economic sanctions approved by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday.
According to Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, the Trump-signed Sanctions Act is a “complete trade war.”
Even if Russian reactions were to be carried out only by political rhetoric as highlights and overprofits, the tightening between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short month of Trump’s election.
In the United States, it was not easy to pass the sanctions law on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
Congress, however, passed the law by a considerable unanimity, but the approval of the law was said to have been considerably more difficult for the president.
Trump said the bill he signed was “significantly lacking.”
President Trump’s reluctance seems to have been caused by Russia in particular, even though the adoption of a law restricting his powers must have been reluctant.
As is well known, the United States is investigating Russia’s possible interference in the presidential election and the Trump campaign’s Russian ties.
The tightening between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short reign.
When the White House staff has shifted to tight and various scandalous turns have become almost up-to-date, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not done in the United States under the leadership of the president, but despite the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If Russia's relationship is a scam in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's nuclear area in the Baltic Sea also tightens relations.
The EU has clearly maintained the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
While the Union has remained at least the most unified in its Russian policy so far, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member country that has a lot of trade with Russia like Finland, the economic sanctions have been a real mess.
The effects of the U.S. new sanctions law are still unclear.
The EU fears that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects can be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovo nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exoneration of sanctions, for example, of LNG, which is important for the US economy.
Trade sanctions are a means of showing displeasure in world politics.
However, economic sanctions must be well-thought-out and careful.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than beneficial.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House is now on its way to the Statue of Liberty
Intervention is a sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as the rest: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, dropped Saddam Hussein’s statue on Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologists in the Trump administration, was well aware of what was going on in a heated debate with CNN’s Jim Acosta. The Freedom Party was the subject of Miller’s attack in a word-for-word fight that concerned the president’s proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller really didn't criticize the shit himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge flocks of cruise organizers and imitating figures from the Statue of Liberty.
The object of his attack was the significance of the statue, and especially the fact that in 1903 the poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its foot – 17 years after its completion.
As Miller put it, Acosta: “I don’t want to go more into history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom illuminating the world.
The poem was added later and does not belong to the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller himself was not wrong, but it’s not just about history, as he himself said.
Essential are the words of Lazarus, the only of its kind, in which the state not only invites immigrants but "the poorest": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses longing to breathe free, / The wretched refusal of your teming shore."
The poem is now more relevant than ever.
Miller did not practice literary criticism at all, but made it clear that “the poorest” are not welcome in Trump’s United States.
Controversy over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a wider political and cultural debate on the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus’ friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to a statue on his feet, knowing that the act was highly political.
The purpose of the treaty was to express the connections of French and American republicanism with a classical analogy, the female embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poetry, the feishahmo is no longer an abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiles.
Adding the poem to the mind was a formidable feminist coup d’etat and a devastating attack on the American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back to the original.
In 2010, Rush Limbaugh, a headliner who can now be seen as a sort of predictor of Trump, claimed that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but is an early forerunner of the new-conservatives, who takes the United States to the dark to a hidden world.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
"The controversy doesn't show the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The importance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the ship after a long and tempting journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for protection and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts him by giving hope and by welcoming him.
And that’s not what Miller and Trump want.
Their way does not appear, but the flames of hatred are their only source of strength.
General Athletics World Cup 2017: Neil Black commends Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots entered the UK national team
Neil Black, the executive director of the UK Public Sports Association, said the 16 Scottish national teams participating in the World Championships were “significant reinforcements.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships starting Friday in London.
According to Black, "there is something special happening in Scotland that the UK's public sport has to learn from."
“This is not welcome, and we will continue to investigate it for as long as we understand what the issue is,” Black says.
"I spoke with representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and they thought it was related to the activities of the institute.
The Scottish Public Sports Association believes that it is linked to the activities of the Association,
and the UK Public Sports Association believes that it is the backbone of their activities.
And an ordinary street-walker thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it’s something really great, no matter where it comes from.”
Many Scottish athletes compete for medals in London, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-meter race.
"It's going to be unpredictable.
His captain's speech was incredibly wonderful," Black said.
“The athletes took the opportunity proud of their achievements and were highly motivated regardless of where they could live and practice.
Yesterday’s words had a real feeling and passion for sports.”
Eilidh Doyle is the silver medalist of the National Union Championships in the 400 metres assist race, and these are his fifth World Championships. He believes it is "incredible" that there are 16 Scots in the national team.
The previous record was seven years in 1983 and 2015.
Midway runner Laura Muir has run five UK and two European records in the course of the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare is running 1,500 metres in London, and he should also be kept in mind: he has an excellent season behind him, which includes winning at the UK World Championships and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first world championship, when the only Scotsman in the squad besides him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "extremely proud" that so many Scots are involved, some of whom compete in the finals and medals.
“It’s a great honor to be captain, but even more importantly, it’s because the team members voted for the captain,” Doyle said.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who joined the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They are involved as well-deserved athletes competing for prizes.
Captain's speech?
I think it went well.
I was focused on how lucky we are when we have a home.
It is important to enjoy the support of the public and that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere is going to be unbelievably wonderful."
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don’t Set a Condition to Public Service if You Can’t Resist Criticism
Our country's father knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all his possible domestic politics, from his political principles.
Criticism must have been annoying.
But he did not silence his critics.
“If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as stupid and silent as sheep to be slaughtered,” Washington said in 1783.
That's how we get to Governor Larry Hogan in Maryland, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their contributors.
The U.S. Citizens' Rights League called for Hogan's trial earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge unfounded, and his attitude was also detrimental online.
"What matters? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an astoundingly popular Republican governor of the Democratic-run state.
He has been ranked second among the top 50 governors in his career.
Hogan is not sensitive to heat.
He has led the state in a stable manner and has adhered to the principles.
He has also skillfully used Facebook as the main channel of communication for his voters and posted a picture of his chemotherapy slipped head there.
Therefore, blocking users coming to the Governor’s Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor’s page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax rates.
Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the Governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, which he said was merely a moderation of comments.
However, stamping commentators into trolls, scumbags or haters is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed users who were blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk with the leaders of their choice. They were not trolls but teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors, for example.
They said that their comments were respectful, attentive and relevant.
The pastor borrowed the Bible in his comment; he wanted to appeal to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Rama from Maryland Bowie was not hostile, but asked about hate crimes.
“I kindly commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news,” he wrote in comments to the Washington Post.
“I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately considered to be a sort of organized group and are being ignored by a large group of concerned citizens.”
The governor's staff called the comments a "centered attack" and someone else might call them to promote what's considered important.
In the age of Facebook, communication is easy to manage by blocking a critic or deleting a critical comment.
Before the old man should have sent staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical headlines published, or to arrest and silence protesters.
It’s actually the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of hacking Facebook and other social media channels.
The Twitter users blocked by President Trump have challenged him in court.
The first major decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria District Court Judge James C. Cacheriks, the Loudoun County government violated the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution by blocking voters on Facebook.
And the U.S. Citizens’ Rights League went to discuss with Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be difficult.
At the time of Washington, low-cost postal payments had a similar effect as today’s internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers mocked Washington.
There were trolls back then.
The names Juricola, Valerio, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers in which they mocked Washington’s decisions.
The president's office was flooded with petitions criticizing Jay's agreement, the US-British Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement, as evidenced by the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately.
Samples have come from about half a dozen places, and in addition, online announcements from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from South and Varsinais Finland, but then also individual from Haapavede and Seinäjol, says specialist researcher Marja Isomursu Evira.
Green chips have died of the so-called trichomonosis of glossy disease.
It originates from a scientific animal called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to strike the whales, and especially the cockroaches.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also detected in chicks.
In 2009 it rained well.
At that time, the trichomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish green pepper stock, after which the species’ positions have recovered.
There have now been sick green peppers, but at least not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, Museummaster of the Central Museum of Natural Sciences (Luumus) at the University of Helsinki.
It is scary that the previous epidemic of green peppers will resume if nothing is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that anyone can do: stop the birds’ summer feeding immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to take advantage of home field at Renaissance Club
Former European first player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field over the next three days as the Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open in East Lothian.
Rafferty from Northern Ireland led a tournament at the nearby Archerfield Links last year before the last round, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has enjoyed a new place and serves as the ambassador of the tournament for the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will reach its full splendor,” Rafferty says.
"Players see the field at their best, it's in great condition.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is an enthusiastic messenger of the game, and he is proud of his achievements here.
The tournament is a great showcase for this field.”
Englishman Eales defends the championship for the first time, although he has won in his 32-year career both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"This feels like a really special occasion," said the Southport player.
“I couldn’t defend my win at the Extremadura Open because the tournament isn’t part of the tournament this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
“Last year’s memories come back to mind: winning the tournament was a wonderful thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember.”
Gary Orr returns to the real world on his own ground, taking part in the tour after completing 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“Playing at home is always more meaningful than usual,” says Orr in Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I enjoyed playing again and played a lot of hard.
I’m happy with my game so far.”
The three are followed by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament is attended by six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Possible indoor air problems of the casserole were clarified in the back
At least so far, there have been no internal air problems in the box office building of the Pori prikata messaging company, the prikata was reported on Thursday.
Internal air investigations will continue.
The investigations began when the man who suspended his men’s service for health reasons thought that his health was weakened due to poor indoor air.
Lieutenant-Colonel Mika Holman, Chief of Staff of the Pori Prikat, said there were no health problems with the other deputies.
It turned out that this was an individual case and that the other servants in that unit had no health problems.
Every statement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this in detail.
At the moment, we do not know that we would have any indoor air problems, Holma says.
Prikaat's announcement said that due to the arrival in July, the goods had to be transferred to the barracks, and therefore the dustiness could be increased temporarily.
That could have made the air seem so hot, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesian gold
Bardina Degei doesn't use sandwiches in the kitchen.
He also rarely uses a cat.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Pania region, located in the restless Indonesian province of Papua. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the batata – locally “note” – directly on his arrival.
Half an hour later, the batata burned on the curve was eaten with the bare, unwashed hands.
Dege’s home has no furniture. He sits on a mutant painted floor, where he usually also handles his daily steps, such as washing from a nearby mouth in the required saline water.
The office of the store is supplied by the scum in the roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her four wives, and she has not been assigned fields for treatment.
Multimarriage is common here.
Late work can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot.
“No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening,” Degei says.
This is a rare turmoil in the everyday highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. Before the annexed, a controversial referendum in which 1,026 villagers were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed the Dutch government, quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, which holds the region tightly under control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from accessing it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The journey starts at an hour and a half from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and continues with a five-hour turbulent drive by renting a car.
There is no public transport here.
About 19,000 inhabitants of the city are surrounded by bamboo trees, whose coral reeds have been dyed into bell-brown.
Only a few Indonesians have visited here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the natives of Papuan Mee Pago worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We didn't have that kind of clothes," Degei says. He means colorful, hand-woven with a velvet headband, a dark hammer and a bright-coloured purse.
"Before us, we only had magazines to cover our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, with the highest child mortality and numerical impairment in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia’s gold.
Paniai is a suburb of about the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000. Just about a hundred kilometers from Paniai is Grasberg, the world’s largest and most productive gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMora, based in Phoenix, United States.
In 2015, the mine produced <0x24>3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated <0x24>78 billion in wood reserves.
However, for the people of Papua, these riches bring misery, for they mean the oppressive presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and military units nearly <0x24>20 million between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers were paid up to <0x24>150,000.
The demands for a higher right to self-determination threaten this source of income, and they are silenced without mercy.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 Papuans since 1969 and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings at the heights of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s resulted in genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in peaceful protests in the area.
The Brisbane Archbishop’s 2016 report We Will Lose Everything contains reports of last year’s atrocities, such as executions without trial, torture – rape and e-hitting are particularly popular – and ruthless attacks on peacekeepers.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of casualties because there are cases weekly,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Screws have been tightened as Papua’s natural resources attract immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but their population is changing as Indonesia’s populous islands of Jaavan, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi move Muslims to the region in hopes of better treatment.
Jaawali warung dishes sell roasted chicken and gado-gado vegetables in a peanut butter.
The locals are hard to compete.
“Moderators have started selling chicken and vegetables on the market cheaper than locals,” says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Pania and moved to the provincial capital after work.
"Local women have lost their clients."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – promised in his 2014 campaign to address Papua’s injustices and human rights violations.
Papua is made up of 29 regions, and this former wooden bat won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on its way to Jakarta’s presidential palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel they have been cheated.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowia in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice,” You said.
It was only two months after Jokow's October insurgency.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs in Enarotal on December 7, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on motorcycles.
The scared children told the soldiers that they should use the timers.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebain, the man returned to the scene with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers arrested the children and abused them with gunshot wounds.
So one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of abuse.
A few hours later, the building of the state electoral board near the venue was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand Papuans – young men and women and children – gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They had hunting suits for the festivities, and they began to perform a traditional waita dance in the Papuan Mee Pago home, dancing in a circle and imitating a bird song.
Some of the protesters began to stone police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere was hot, the soldiers were ordered in an internal radio system: "If the crowds make resistance more than three times, shoot them dead." The information is based on an official document, which has not been released to local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, a resident of the Kego Koto district, was aware of the situation and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left rim," he told TIME magazine in a bright colored wooden house with a stool.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the rows of soldiers.
"In response, several shots were fired."
Alfius Youwia was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shots.
“I ran to him and made sure it was really him,” Johannes told TIME in a sad way. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua police inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were only “protecting” the police station because it was the target of the attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papacy police, said in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The death was reported in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, in Jayapura, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the Papua violence would be tackled.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that nothing like it will ever happen again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he will launch investigations into human rights violations outside the justice system.
However, he immediately cancelled his speech.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but it requires certain processes,” he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta 5.6.2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he did not intend to start investigations with Papua.
“Everything will be resolved in court,” he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity". The crimes relate to the deaths of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including Pania.
The families of the victims are disbelieving in the dark.
“I’ve been interviewed four times over the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way,” John says.
"I'm tired of this."
She says she’s still living in fear, even though it’s been years.
"Yes, I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panicans do not dare to discuss the event.
He tells us that the soldiers had abused him when he had helped to bury four of the victims.
“Soldiers are looking for me in their hands after the victims are buried,” he says.
The shootings are not over.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot down villagers in the neighbouring district of Pania in Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a clash between the villagers and the construction company manager, which started when the manager refused to take the man who had lost his consciousness to the hospital.
The man in need of hospital treatment was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had fallen into the water while fishing on a nearby river, and died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers showed their mind on the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to police, villagers stoned policemen who responded with warnings.
According to local authorities, the Indonesian semi-state police unit, however, opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
"We are afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Domunggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Deiyan's parliament has called for gunshots from police officers to be held accountable and for the removal of a moving police unit from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal families who live in the wetlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans through random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of OPM are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily detaining and detaining thousands of people in Pania in the name of "safeguarding national sovereignty".
Some of the detainees never return.
Among the Papuans, the Paniai is known as "a terrible, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is only a small amount of rice for sale in Enarotal, and this is too expensive for locals,
Just like bread.
People grow their own food: mainly batatas and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a woman’s job, and one woman’s responsibility can be four or five battalions.
Most of the proceeds are to the family, and the rest are sold on the market.
Ten beats only cost 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the disparities between local and translators have increased, and the number of translators has increased since the opening of new routes to Namarie Airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go local to better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Only a few Papuans have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village because there’s no work or money here,” said John Gobai, president of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Faraway Papua is left with little attention in the world.
In addition, the restrictions on international newscasting are still strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basil Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they were granted a rare description permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Assistant Director of Human Rights Watch in Asia, Jokowi has not kept his election promises, has not increased transparency and has not promoted development by removing news restrictions.
"Newspapers in Indonesia's restlessest eastern provinces from Papua and Western Papua have new risks: visa waivers and blacklisting," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that only Papua’s neighbours are under pressure from the Indonesian government.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua 'numerous and widespread violations', including the Pania attack.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with press freedom, so hiding evidence of human rights violations would be difficult."
The locals want the governments of the foreign powers to intervene.
When the official Dutch delegation, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, 2017, locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, according to an anonymous source who participated in the meeting.
Indonesia has a 2019 presidential election, but the Papuans say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowia.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who have been involved in the Pania shooting," said Gobai, president of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panicians: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in a shortage and poverty, practically without health care and education opportunities.
According to Gobain, the Panians, like the other Papuans, consider Jokow's votes to be "debted" and to be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Pania attack once again showed a comparative resistance: they buried one of the victims in a country opposite the police station and the military headquarters.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they won’t let the responsible forget their crimes.
"My family members were killed," Yacobus says in his head.
"What else could we do?"
Dereck Chisora says Robert Helenius's rematch cancelled: "Even his fans don't want to see"
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisoran were scheduled to play in the Hartwall Arena on May 27.
However, the game was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora explains the reason for a rematch flop completely on Helenius’ chests.
My game in Finland was floppy, but it wasn’t my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even her fans don't want to see her taking care of her, because she's miserable, Chisora quiets.
Helenius and Chisora first met in full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial penalty.
The ticket sale of the re-match went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Itta-Sanom in May that the match had been postponed to autumn.
There's nothing new in the comic.
However, the resignation will no longer harm Chisora.
The match would probably have had to be cancelled after Chisora got sick.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up with severe pain.
My tyrant was exploding.
At the hospital, I was told to cut me, Chisora tells me.
The UK says it is currently in about 45 percent condition.
He is not interested in the rematch with Helenius, but Dillian Whyte is the main goal.
Chisora suffered a loss for Whyte in December.
Coming to power to replicate Torch cloud painter in Dubai
On Friday, the world’s tallest residential building in Dubai, hundreds of residents were forced to flee a 79-story building 337 meters high.
This was already the second fire in two years in a building named Torch, shattered.
The building was emptied, and no one knows that it was damaged, and the cause of the fire was unknown immediately after the incident.
“We were sleeping and we woke up with a fire alarm and people screaming.
"We would run stairs down the 50th floor, which took ten minutes," George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai rescue authorities, the fire extinguishers were extinguished at 4 a.m. local time and left the building cooled.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The incident may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior surfaces of high-rise buildings around the world.
After the 2015 fire, the Torch building’s board of directors conducted a study that found that the most damage was caused to the rooftop and insulation panels.
In the UK, police believe that the insulation and curtain panels at London’s Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid progression of flames in the fire that killed 80 people in June.

In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers take illegal items on board, a survey reveals
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had consciously or unknowingly transported prohibited items into aircraft past the checkpoints of the U.S. Traffic Safety Agency (TSA).
Less than 1% said they only later learned that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey was conducted by more than a thousand passengers and was conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, which also revealed that young passengers are more likely to violate the rules.
19.7 per cent of consciously violating TSA rules were Y-Generation representatives and less than 15 per cent belonged to X-Generation.
Most often, the rules were violated by transporting food and liquids to the aircraft.
More than three per cent admitted consciously transporting items with a blade to the aircraft, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported consciously transporting illicit drugs to the aircraft.
Passengers from all over the United States participated in the survey, and the company that conducted the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally passed the security check and how many people had done so consciously.
It’s no surprise that most travelers are also more likely to pass a security check, whether consciously or unconsciously.
But as the surveying company notes, TSA’s instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids to take on the plane and how much.
It is no surprise, therefore, that most of the TSA’s confiscations are liquid.
For a while there was also the idea that books should not be taken to the plane.
Liquids are allowed for domestic flights, but not for international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, cited his decision to postpone Obama’s decision to reduce emissions.
The day after 15 states challenged Scott Pruitt, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to court, Pruitt revoke his previous decision to postpone the Obama administration’s decision to reduce emissions from smoke.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency led by him takes better account of the needs of the environmental decision makers in the states.
Pruitt did not even mention the case brought against his previous decision in the Federal Court of Appeal.
States Parties should begin to comply with the 2015 terrestrial ozone requirements level from 1.10.
Pruitt announced in June that he will postpone the implementation of the decisions one year ahead so that he has more time to familiarize himself with the plan, as the agency "does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was the Oklahoma State Attorney General before President Donald Trump appointed him as the director of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental rules.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions resisted by the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is Pruitt's latest return to the plan to alleviate the provisions.
Last month, the U.S. Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Mr Pruitt argued that his full revision of the Ozone Rules would only strengthen EPA's cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements according to the timetable.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to challenge it to the court to reach an agreement on timetables," Pruitt said.
“We do not believe in the regulatory process and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and its Finnish mandates for us."
However, the EPA's opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to exercise "his powers to delay the implementation of the decisions as well as other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are enacting a broader amendment to the Ozone Rules.
The legislative initiative adopted last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the EPA’s lawsuit this week, said the group will continue to press.
“The EPA’s change in protest as a result of our complaints is a significant win for those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smoke in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the suit included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Earth’s ozone is generated when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil processing plants and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This can lead to severe respiratory problems for sensitive groups of people, as well as to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists welcomed Pruitt’s surprising change of direction.
“It’s worrying how much pressure was required for the guy in charge of our breathing climate to use common sense,” says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biodiversity.
“We have to fight the Trump administration because it’s ideological objective is to act on the terms of the polluters and other groups of self-interest.”
Supercar manufacturer coming to the top of the car - "it happens in the style of Ferrari"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to keep up with its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in the style of Ferrari, CEO Sergio Marchionne said at a news conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year as the Italian supercar manufacturer unveils its new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All cases of East Savannah ash with the same virus type
Coastal salmon ash infection is the same type of virus as in previous cases of East Savon, THL reports.
On Thursday, the Virology Laboratory of the Institute for Health and Welfare confirmed that the fifth infection in East Savon is the same strain of the virus as previous infections.
THL has ensured that the ash infection confirmed on Friday, July 28, in a person on the coastal island has the same type of virus as in previous cases in Eastern Savoy.
On the basis of this information, all the infections detected in Eastern Savoy are related to the first, ash crust detected in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not developed any other types of ash tuberculosis.
However, it is possible that new infections from the fifth after the disease may occur until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not over yet, says Dr. Mirkaleena Erkkilä, in charge of basic health care.
There has been no evidence of new ashworm infections or their suspicions after the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important for everyone to take care of their own vaccination, Erkkilä recalls.
More on the topic: Three new ash infections were confirmed in Pirkanland - "Additional infections or epidemics very unlikely"
Finland prepares for legally smart action
Pontika's cooking was not even considered legal.
In the background the principle that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with wine.
Making a stone at home is legal next year, but it is not even considered to legalize a chickpea.
The rock is made by fermentation, the punch again by distillation.
The reason behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol along with wine, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to set the bridge for every man's right, commented the government councillor Ismo Tuominen on the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the ministry was preparing the reform of the alcoholic beverage, the distillation of the bridge was not considered legal.
It was also not brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberation of distillation, said MEP Outi Mäkelä (cook).
He is in the negotiating group of government parties, which took a stand on the reform of alcohol.
A permit for distillation of a bridge at home can not be granted even on application.
The commercial production will also remain licensing.
The introduction of alcoholic beverages to the home comes with a simple rule: alcohol is allowed to be made at home for exercise.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make smart at home.
The government wants to simplify the rules.
The new law eliminates the demands of flavourings and flavourings and allows for a sleek manufacturing, the Smoothness to be refined.
The preparation must still be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or flavourings produced by their fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, drinks can be prepared as much as they want, and alcohol can be given as a gift.
It is still not allowed to be sold.
Kiljut’s action is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominenen believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from the Office and other EU countries were liberated.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Finland.
The proposal for the Alcohol Act is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
Alcohol law comes to the hearing of the House as soon as the county season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It’s as if the government has already taken a stand.
Oscar Pistorius has been imprisoned in hospital by armed guards
The victim, Oscar Pistorius, was admitted to a South African hospital for suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius has already escaped from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is sentenced to prison in Atteridgeville.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pains, but he left the hospital in the afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for examination.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete was well.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkampi in February 2013.
Littered telephone conversations reveal Trump’s push to build Mexico’s border wall
Literary talks between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked to the Washington Post.
Trump called on Mexico’s President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public talks on the fact that he will not pay the proposed border wall.
U.S. President Nieto called over the fact that this had publicly bullied the wall project. “You can’t say that to the press,” Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a letter from Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which a tense exchange of words took place.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the U.S. would accept refugees on their way to Australia is "smiling", "sweet" and "typical", according to Trump, the deal negotiated during Obama's time would make him look "idiotic" because he had proposed banning refugees from relocating.
Trump told Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant call of the day.”
Georgian bloodshed: Activists staged again in hopes of racist justice
The Ford Mercury car passes the crowd in the small town of Monroe in rural Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers in the car and a white driver, four armed men crossing the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the band, a middle-aged man dressed in a track suit, takes a deep breath from his siblings and whispers through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" the man whispered.
"Get out of the car!"
Screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a replay that was presented on July 22, 2017.
However, the whisperings of the hurricane are real when the hirtshooter is worn on the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to re-establish the events of 1946, when Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested over these years – even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the re-arrangement.
“It is the burden of history, but above all it is the burden that weighs our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian Congressman.
To him, re-education is a shocking call to action, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been rectified.
"We want the culprits to be brought to justice. We want things finally to be resolved, and we want to recover from grief and make a deal, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make a deal until we get justice."
The investigator covers the body of the victim who died in the Georgian bloodshed on July 27, 1946.
According to NBC news, more than 50 men were suspected of smuggling from Monroe and the surrounding districts.
No one has been charged with murder.
Even though the culprits have been free for decades, according to activists, the motives for lynching have always been known to locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Georgian Blacks received the Supreme Court's decision to vote for the first time in the presidential election. The Supreme Court passed its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident during the election, in which black landowner Roger Malcom stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently affected Malcom's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, it was rumored in the city that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting this child.
According to the FBI, influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcom a <0x24>600 bail on July 25, 1946, against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It has been revealed that Harrison ordered and ordered murders," the FBI said in a statement.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities. The authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more centrally.
"It was a vote-right murder," he says.
“They were murdered because they wanted to tell black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were to vote.”
Cassandra Greene has been directing the rehabilitation of the Georgian bloodshed for nearly a decade.
The presentation is extremely realistic and captivating; it is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe is already lost in the United States of today.
It’s hard to watch, but it’s even harder not to see what Greene says.
“We don’t want to talk about slippery slopes because we would have to face our own dark side,” the director says.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or don't want to hear what I've had to experience."
Exercises for this year’s performance began in June, and on the first day about 30 actors – a dozen blacks and a dozen whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been representing the local leader of the Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always equally difficult and resistant.
“It feels dirty because I’m not myself,” Marbaugh says.
"However, it is important that this aspect of history be kept in mind so that it will never be repeated again."
On the other side of the room are Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show starts with a scene where Malcom screams and whispers Hester, and he's angry that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear? I said you left my country, n---u!"
Rascona or Hester responds.
Then we're going to hit.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) sneaks in laughter.
Greene laughed at me.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally get too strong?" he asks.
"No," Greene whispered.
"I just don't think the whites used the word n--u at the time."
"Yes," another black-eyed actor confirms.
"It's a slang. You need to use a longer version."
The subject of the presentation is unpleasant, but the power of the room is the spirit of the guy.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the show, they want to honor the memory of those who died.
Destiny starts from the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are plain.
No one's laughing.
The retreat ends quickly and violently.
Screaming, shooting, and silence.
A woman dressed in a black graveyard stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday’s Strange Fruit.
His voice is shattered with every other word.
Fifty-five meters away, the spectator wipes his eyes with sweat and tears.
Almost half of the audience are black and half white.
Among them is a couple who have come to watch a show from Ithaca, New York, but most are local.
They've been on Brooks' guidance at the victims' graves in Georgia's wetlands.
The murders have turned from the story to the truth, and the feeling on the scene is heavy.
After the song's performance, Greene invites a crowd to check the bodies.
Kids crawl to look at the blood and immovable bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutters as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the public.
The actors who performed the sparkling performances remove their references and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw greets Marbaugh, the man who was introduced to the local leader of the Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona beats two actors and then bursts into tears after a hard performance.
"It's okay," the woman in the show consoled.
"We know you're not him.
You did it for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and the actors will meet for a joint dinner.
A white couple from Altan discusses the show with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it hard to find words when she describes the emotions aroused by the performance.
“It’s hard to listen to terrible words and watch terrible deeds that people say and do that look the same as you – just because they look the same as you,” he says.
"My performance made me realize that slapping is still happening," he added. "They are just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning for next year’s show.
“Reflecting is a powerful experience because it depicts the horrors we experience, but it’s also a teaching experience,” Brooks says.
“The message is that this can happen again if we don’t take our lessons from it.
Those who don’t know their history are condemned to repeat it.”
Growing vegetables in stores is booming: by removing this amount of "extra parts" it will really save
Is it permissible to remove flowers from the store before weighing?
How about taking out a big hat from the pineapple - how much does it weigh?
The answers strongly share opinions: for one, it is an indication of the most exported nutmeg, while others do not want to pay for the parts of the vegetables that they do not use and that still go to waste at home.
The phenomenon is identified in stores.
For example, in the K-Citymarket vegetable department in Ruoholah, Helsinki, there are boxes of paper, as many ripen, for example, the leaves of the flower pot.
From the box, the magazines are traded into biowaste.
According to the news published in the Economic News, peeling with vegetables is surprising to traders.
But how much of removing the extra parts of vegetables before weighing really saves money?
How important is it really to read a book?
We Women will test how the price changes when you take the leaves or stems from pineapple, latva-artisoka, delicate seedlings, peach and floral.
Flower pot: The price of a flower pot that costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.10 came to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.80 when all the leaves were cut off.
Pineapple: The price of the whole pineapple, which cost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.30, fell to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.95 when its stock dropped.
Latvian artifact: The price of 2.60 euros was 2.40 euros when the short-term stock was cut off.
Delicacies: Two delicacies cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Parsalaal: Medium-sized parsalaal cost 1 euro and without carrying 80 cents.
Outcome: If the leaves and stocks go off, save at best a few dozen cents for one vegetable.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20 percent.
Of these purchases, a total of <0x24>1.20 would have been saved!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona - Brazilian star signed a five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French football club PSG, according to AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million to FC Barcelona, a footballer in the Spanish league.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million transfer is the highest in football history.
The previous record was at Manchester United, which paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million to Paul Pogba last summer.
The Spanish league suspended the transfer earlier on Thursday, when it rejected Neymar's first payment company.
According to the rules of the league, the buyer cannot pay the prize directly to the seller, but the player must buy his contract out himself, which happens by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be presented to the new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa examines the details
In addition, Barcelona said in its announcement that it provided information on the payment by the European Football Association Uefalle, so that the association could determine any disciplinary measures that might arise from the case.
Among other things, Spanish league president Javier Tebas has suspected PSG's use of money to violate Uefa's financially fair game rules.
The Uefa can punish a penalty, which will make more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million in losses over three years.
According to Uefa, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically violate its economic constraints.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG has had an impact on the economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players at significant sums, UEFA said.
PSG is owned by state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The group is chaired by former tennis player Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.

21-year-old Austin was fired from a mystery attack - a stamp was stored in an airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing regular work on a plane at the South Florida International Airport with a couple of workmates when suddenly a lightning from the rainy sky hit the plane.
The force of the Salama threw the plane near the wing of Dunn's land.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns around his body.
My dad called me and said my brother had an electric shock and he's in the hospital.
I asked her if she was alive, says Austin's sister Autumn.
Austin spent two weeks in hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and brain bleeding.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
There's no such thing to be expected.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the representative of the airport, the safety warning system was in place at the time of the case and the transport company itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
British training group Pearson announced on Friday that it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut shares by 72 per cent when launching a new Structural Plan in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, the job reductions will be carried out mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019. The company has already reduced 4,000 jobs in the context of previous construction arrangements.
Pearson announced that it would again cut costs by <0xC2><0xA3>300 million in May as part of its third savings program, which aims to revive declining business as a result of rapid digitization.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann. The company said it considered its current year's outlook to be the same. Its turnover grew by <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Attack in Kabul: NATO soldier dies in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military-operated Afghan capital in Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others, according to authorities.
According to NATO, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh area of Kabul.
The blast is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month, killing 30 people in a mosque blast in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bombing at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said Thursday evening's blast occurred when a NATO-Afghan military joint battalion was attacked "by carrying a person with a self-propelled explosive device".
The statement said that the condition of all the injured was stable and they were treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondence exchangers, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of ISIS in Qarabagh are significant concerns for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% were in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide bombing in Kabul, where predominantly Shia Muslims live.
The Taliban said it was behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in central Kabul, the country's most destructive militant group attack since U.S.-led forces invaded the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump considers whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to the letter exchangers, the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly weakened people's confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA rounds its decision to postpone the implementation of the sabotage rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cited its decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama administration’s emission-reducing decisions a day after 15 states challenged the agency’s lawsuits.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called "ozone definitions" in 2015 late Wednesday, according to the Agency, indicating its commitment to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to meet the needs of the states," Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency’s intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year to October 2018. According to the definitions, dust pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced according to stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 mostly Democratic-run states, including the District of Columbia, and said the suspension was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to alleviate the Obama environmental rules, according to Trump, the measures are part of a broader program for economic growth.
Trump’s measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists, who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to the EPA's website, breathing ozone-containing air "can weaken lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the leader of ISIS had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
It was suspected that the bomb was due to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the operation was suspended before a security checkup.
The police did not say why the company was suspended.
The second plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colorless gas emitting device and take it to a full public place, for example in public transport.
Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorists’ plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plots, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will also be continued.
Managing Director of Liquids: Renewable fuels did well
Oil distributor Liquide’s earnings before taxes fell, but hit forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievosen, the company achieved good results in oil products, the sales of renewable products rose to a record level and the growth in the marketing & services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable business profits were improved by the U.S. Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievos, the profits of renewable products remained good this year due to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, although the tax relief ended.
Implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will complete the strategic investments we previously announced in 2017, Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatchenko discuss possible meeting at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be at the collision course for the most interesting punch match in the near future of the 66.7-kilometer series, met for the second time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel premises in Los Angeles until WBC's invincible lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked the corridor to greet Lomatschenko, WBO's top steamer champion.
On Saturday, Garcia won the Showtime by a unanimous decision of former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner, after which Garcia and Lomatchenko were among the top five in the comparison list of different weight classes.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, "How are you doing, Master?
Good luck to the show!"
Lomatchenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday.
When the duo posed for photographers, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that the men's match would be "perfect in terms of size".
"I'm a former vampire," Garcia recalled.
"I went to the top of the series [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm 63.5-kilo.
I want to go back to the light.
He's got to go up to the lightweight series [61.2 kg]. Then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
They fulfill their wishes.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"Science needs this game."
Climate asked if the match should be organised on the pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomatchenko, according to which Lomatchenko debuted in the lightweight series later this year and will also play in the next summer at Garcia (37–0.Kökreetsa.Kökreetta.At Campbellia Liorje and Liorge Likkua.
"The match could be on the pay channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that she was ready to play on the channel that offers the best prize package.
“We are the most interesting names.
No one else gets as much attention.
It's okay for me as soon as we get to the deal."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomatchenko as an "incredible player" and that he might go to see the game on Saturday.
Lomatchenko interrupted Garcia's flight and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow. I'm sorry, Mike... but you needed it to be pushed."
Garcia said she was focused first on showing off the force, and then on punching.
The men said they felt that the match between them wanted to take place more and more strongly.
“This is the game that is expected.
No other match will attract as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this," Garcia said.
Lomatchenko said he expected to be able to take on the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It will be a great match.”
Average salary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,300, training what suffers - the situation of investment withdrawal was "village and free"
The quality of investment has talked a lot lately.
Last time, Sanomat in Helsinki told about Ritva, 68, to whom the investment advisers of the banking business spoke when selling a whole bunch of investment products.
The rules on investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The tightenings are based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the skills of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is based mainly on self-regulation.
The law does not define the skills requirements.
The Financial Sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service complete their own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of degrees for a company named APV-Investition Studs Oy, which in the degree thesis group consists of experts from both the Financing Supervisory (Fiva) and universities as well as industry operators.
The degrees are 12-15 credits, and their exams are produced by Aalto EE i.e. Aalto University Executive Education Oy.
Its website states that, in general, both tests are "very broad in terms of requirements".
The content of the degrees includes 10-15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV-investitustudnots Ltd., says that the percentage of passing tests is roughly around 70 estimates.
Most of the staff of the largest banks have completed either the APV1 or APV2 degrees, as these are mandatory under the rules of the companies themselves.
Then there are smaller banking businesses, not to mention names, whose staff influences the completion of mapping degrees, says Savikko.
According to him, such banking transactions are “variable”.
According to Saviko, the APV1 degree has been completed by 13,000 to 14,000 people since 2000, and about 3,000 people have passed the APV2 degrees recommended for more demanding investment advisors.
Some banking companies consider it an advantage to obtain a degree.
A number of other sectors have significantly more stringent skills requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Recommendation requires the completion of APV degrees, because that is when knowledge related to the investment sector is ensured.
According to the Statistical Centre, financial and investment advisors are paying on average several thousand euros per month, including commissions, grants and earnings fees.
The average monthly salary is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,300.
On average, men who work for jobs earn an average of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,900 a month and women, respectively, more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,500.
On average, a tenth of the most successful earns about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,100.
A tenth of the most skilled men earns more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9,000 a month or more, and a tenth of the most skilled women earn <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by an authorised company.
The worker and task level has so far relied on self-regulation.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out by it was subject to individual cases where the investment advisor’s expertise and competence were not sufficient on the basis of the advisor’s activities.
As a seller of investment products, it is also possible, in principle, to act even if professional skills and qualifications are at a high level.
Basically, in this respect, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other sectors have significantly more stringent skills requirements, says Savikko.
According to Saviko, this will be tightened by the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II) from the beginning of next year.
This requires that each company be responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services is sufficiently skilled.
Financial supervision, on the other hand, has the power to determine what needs to be done.
Marko Hovi, Fiva’s market supervisor, says that one of the clear changes to the current is the legislation on the requirements for the know-how and experience of investment advisers and seller of investment products.
According to Hovin, the new requirements apply both to the own staff of investment firms and to colleagues who sell products on behalf of a company.
Hovi says that, according to a proposal from the government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will be given the authority to determine knowledge and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided by these outlooks in the coming autumn.
The company must also continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and complementary training.
All this needs to be documented, and the company has the obligation to prove that this has also been done.
Hovi clarifies that, in practice, the company must, for example, map staff performance at an individual level.
This will certainly come at different levels of requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to Hovin, there is also a new requirement to work with someone who is more experienced in the deadline if the knowledge or experience is not sufficiently high.
That is, if a company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain amount of time.
According to Hovin, with the change, the rules are tightening and concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened in early 2018.
Image: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "piss" a giant plane over the U.S.
The flight route on the plane was limited to the United States by Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out on Thursday with the 787 Dreamliner, which Boeing tested the durability of the aircraft’s Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane departing Seattle flew 18 hours and 1 minute on a journey of 15,700 kilometers, which is longer than any regular commercial route in use in the world.
The flight remained within the U.S. borders throughout the trip.
It flew through a total of 17 states.
Iines Kaikkonen skidded with the help of a swimming pool in Iines Kaikkonen - Iines Kaikkonen
Iines Kaikkonen progressed at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach schools will run in Liette and Lempuka this and next week.
Even though it rains occasionally and then shines again, the young swimmers are not a moxie, says swim school puller Taina Itkonen.
In swimming schools this week, a total of 13 children will be mapped, next week a decade.
The number of children in the next week was affected by the fact that the school and the school are already starting, Itkonen estimates.
The Imatra Beach School is organised in cooperation with the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, Liettee’s swimming beach was a pleasant atmosphere.
The sun was shining and the young swimmers had to train on the surface to stay with the swimmers, someone even without the air.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines from Kaikok, 5, first thought of going deeper into the water.
Taina Itkonen, however, encouraged her to push her towards the beach.
It's going great!
Iines Kaikkonen said he went swimming a lot this summer.
Swimming pool is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkosen, Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You can also be satisfied with today’s achievements, swimming leafy.
Jami Kallio, 4, once again wanted to go to the waterfront.
His daughter Anna Villberg, 6, who followed swimming from the beach, Ilona Villberg considers beach swimming school a good start to swimming.
Even though the weather has been what it hurts, Anna likes to come here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swimming schoolchildren packed up.
The boys had enough of a snail found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread the towels on the slopes, sprinkled the fruits and brightened the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but there was no rush.
One that doesn't belong in the summer.
An Unknown Soldier Sells Toothbrushes - "Here's a Combining Story"
You can see it in every way.
A few days ago, Siniprodukte, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product range.
So, printed bags and laundry liners, and a "wc brush on the edge."
An unknown soldier refers to the film and leffa marketing he will receive this fall.
Yet there is something special in the combination, and the products have been debunked on social media: When will the Unknown health benefits come?
You have to call the company and ask what the question is.
What does Deputy Chief Executive Officer Aino Me<0xC4><0x91>etta say?
We are a film partner.
We are supporting this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, M<0xC3><0xA5><0xC3><0xA5>tta says.
According to him, the products will be specialised in motion pictures, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn't this something a little funny - often when you think that products and related stories have something in common?
Yes, this is a kind of combining story that we are a Finnish actor and these are Finnish products, says M<0xC3><0xA5>ätta.
According to him, the company supports the same Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown soldier.
And cleaning is not a stranger to military culture, M<0xC4><0x81><0xC4><0x9F>ta notes.
Other business partners in the film Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall vichyts, which are found in Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela, have been introduced to the market.
Unknown products have already been cancelled by Finnish blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are also available.
Kinnunen notes that there is still time for the film’s first night, so the sequel is still on promise.
For example, Valio, Processor, Liquide and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes, have not yet disclosed their war products from unknown partners.
New results of age tests for Swedish asylum seekers have been published
The latest results of the medical age tests of asylum seekers in Sweden have been published. The results of the tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of the tests were found to be over the age of 18. However, not everyone considers the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine started testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Agency was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of the applicants who claimed to be minors, and for failing to determine the age of the applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Agency for Immigration has so far carried out 6,880 tests, and the Agency for Forensic Medicine has now published 2,481 test results. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July in 2017.
In 2002, 80 per cent of the applicants were found to be over the age of 18, and in 25 cases, the Agency for Forensic Medicine determined that the applicant was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under the age of 18".
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the applicant’s age.
Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency says the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent. There are no significant differences in the statistics of the previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were found to be over the age of 18, this does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, stating that in 442 cases, there were "signs that an 18-year-old or older should be investigated."
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it was found that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he was 18 years of age this year.
In the medical age assessment method used in the tests, X-rays of the wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the knee bone are taken. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Carolin Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans. It is possible to assess whether a person has become a normal fracture sooner or later.
“I have had reason to think about it, and I think that the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are not able to determine the age, we should not pretend to be able to do it,” he told Metro.
However, the forensic agency Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of identifying a child as an adult is small.
The risk is the highest in a situation where the test will soon reach 18 years. Then the risk is about 10 percent."
Ilonen crashes 30 places in Scotland
In the third round, Mikko Ilosen spent 30 points on the scoreboard down the European Golf Tour in Scotland.
Ilonen left from 11th place on Saturday, but was found to be 41th place at the end of the round.
In a difficult bowl, Izos was accompanied by three bows with one double bow.
It was difficult for others.
Englishman Ian Poulter rose to share the top spot in a one- under-pair round, although he said there was enough work in holding the rain shield.
The time was rough, but with the rookie and finally the day was good, Poulter inches.
He shares the lead with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
Governor of West Virginia to Change Party <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening that he was changing his party at a Trump campaign event.
“The Democrats simply rejected me,” Justice said.
"Today I can tell you, after many prayers and in-depth reflection... Today I will tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience rested on a glimpse of popularity.
"Tomorrow I will be a member of the Republican Party registered," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you, it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised that a major announcement would be made at the campaign event in West Virginia.
In West Virginia, Trump won 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, according to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in the state.
He acquired a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His assets are worth about <0x24>1.59 billion.
On Thursday night, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement stating that "Governor Justice's party swap is once again a new blow to a democratic party that prefers to build barriers rather than a better America."
"The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, the announcement of Justice is the latest return to a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message in the CNC," said RBS in a press release.
Salat seeded damage - Thursday coming up to summer very late day
There will also be more holidays in South Korea this weekend.
During the past week, there have been havocs especially in the central and northern parts of the country, as well as in the region of Varsinais-Finland.
Between Wednesday and Thursday night, the Salamanders set off several fires.
According to meteorologists, Thursday may be a very busy summer day.
The floodwaters have finally found Finland as well.
During the past week, it has salooned especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Finland.
The flash hit the electric center of the line, causing a small fire.
The rescue agency received a report of the fire at about half-hours on Wednesday.
The power station was located in a sauna area at the edge of the line.
Rescue agency dismantled the roof and wall to find firefighters and extinguished the fire.
Eleven apartments were left without electricity, but injuries were avoided.
At the same time, the lightning ignited the outer buildings at Harjulanti before midnight.
By the time the rescue facility arrived, the building was already in its full stage of the fire, and the rescue facility could only prevent the spread of the fire.
The outer building, about fifty square meters, burned to the ground.
At the end of the day, a lightning strikes his own home.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a stunning salamanic attack.
The rescue agency was on the spot to check the case, but this time the lightning did not cause a previous fire - only a few melting cranes.
In traffic, the ukkon caused problems on the train between Seinäjok and Vaasa, when a traffic control system was damaged by the Salamansk.
Information on the case was received on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was resolved just before 5 p.m.
Since then, train traffic has been allowed to continue normally also on the slope of the slope.
Salat has sown destruction in various parts of Finland.
However, salads have been relatively low this summer.
This summer's weather has been very hot! according to Jari Tuovinen, a meteorologist at the Institute of Meteorology.
On Wednesday and Thursday, the thunderstorms have been mostly moderate in strength, but due to the low amount of lightning in the summer, many feel even strong.
This may sound like a really hard dip, but that’s what it has been compared to the dip this summer, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, landslides scrambled 1,700 times, and on Thursday there was potential even for the hardest day of the summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 landslides in the plateau.
If the Salamander continues to the beginning, then more than two thousand Salamanders can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record low was experienced in 2015, when the number of flashes of the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, the number of flashes this year had risen to 18,386 secrets.
It is important not to break the "record" two years ago this year.
However, the firefighter can expect to continue.
According to imports, the air above Finland will also remain warm and humid during the weekend, which is a suitable birth environment for birds.
The main focus of the floods will be on Saturdays from the northernmost parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 secret days can be obtained both on Saturdays and Sundays.
The central part of the country is expected to be more coherent.
In such cases, according to Tuovi<0xC5><0xA1>e, it is rarely used.
Coe commends Russia’s “open” apology to doping channel
World sports club Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described openly, which Russia made on Thursday due to the doping scandal, but Coe added that it was not yet time to end Russia’s ban on participation.
Russian general sports chief Dmitri Shljahtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Cup on Thursday that Russia's ban is appropriate and that he intends to fight doping with determination.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were taken to the gold or silver medals in the competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of a continuation of the ban. Russia was excluded from public sports competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Office provided evidence of state-backed doping in Russia in the WADA report.
"I think his response today was very straightforward; it was a very open presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Public Sports Federation recognized the country’s past difficult times and announced that it would do everything it could to reorganize its activities.”
Coe also said he was "satisfied" with Russia's approval of the terms of the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the Working Group's recommendation that now is not the right time to end Russia's ban," Coe said.
“We need to do something in the next few months to normalize the situation.
“The main principle has always been that we want to keep athletes clean apart from the corrupted system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes are competing with the status of a neutral athlete at the World Cup in London on Friday and have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
The head of the IAAF working group, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many demands before its status can be restored.
"Testing is still insufficient, and trainers who have been banned will continue to operate freely," he told reporters Friday following a presentation he made to the IAAF Council in London.
Producer Disappointed by the Weak Success of Tom of Finland
“Tom of Finland has not been as successful as the authors hoped,” Yle says.
To be honest, I am disappointed, admitting that the film was produced by Helsinki Film CEO Annika Sucksdorff Yle in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June it had reached a fair 100,000 viewership, which is the film’s budget, about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million, compared to little.
There has been no lottery wins, but now it is important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been better at home, they would have already gotten their money.
Now we have to wait for small buckets of foreign spreads, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the economic rules of football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from transferring Spain from Barcelona to France’s Paris Saint-Germain, which is the most expensive transfer of football players of all time.
Its possible penalties for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by the UEFA regulator of European football, which can prevent the teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the fair game’s economic rules, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar’s move has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million for the Brazilian deal, and Neymar's annual salary with the new company is <0x24>10 million.
The transfer of Neymar to France has a variety of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty paying Neymar's transfer fee and connecting him to his star card, as it follows funding Qatar's oil-enriched governing race.
The teams can use large sums to acquire players, but they must be balanced with real income sources so that the soccer-related business is not losing.
The economic rules of the fair game were drawn up on the initiative of French President Michel Platin, who was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success through debt was fraud and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of the fair game economic rules was shifted from the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time at Chelsea in 2003 was significantly difficult. Abramovich bought the promising team, spent huge amounts on player procurement and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of the fair-play economic rules will last until 2018, with a maximum of EUR 30 million in losses.
Although Platini was forced to abandon the post of UEFA president in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, also wants to stop the unauthorized use of money by the clubs.
"The rules of the fair game are still in use, and we will apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, head of the fair game's economic rules at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Even though PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a one-time compensation, it can allocate the amount in accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer amount can be recorded in the yearly course of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million over the next five years.
The first penalties were allocated in 2014 to PSG and to Manchester City, funded by Abu Dhabi, according to the fair-play economic rules.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million, which was subsequently reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and was ordered to limit the club to 21 players in the Champions League group for the 2014–2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors groups that may attempt to circumvent its economic regulations by increasing their revenues through companies associated with the owners of the track.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA will not consider the aid as a result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatari Tourism Authority’s support for PSG was overwhelming.
It has also been revealed that some of Neymar’s earnings at PSG could be funded by fees available to the Qatari FIFA 2022 World Cup.
However, PSG and the Arrangement Committee have refused to make Neymar the ambassador of the World Cup, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to the previous sanctions imposed by PSG, UEFA is following the rules more closely than usual.
Sources said on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated the transfer of Neymar with PSG.
Sources gave the interview to the Associated Press on the condition that their identity will not be disclosed because they do not have the authority to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the most recent published financial statements, PSG’s turnover between 2015 and 2016 was EUR 542.4 million and a profit of more than EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and increase sales of follow-up products and games.
The company estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % under the Neymar Agreement.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of the best player in the world, tried to make it difficult for Neymar to move, allegedly violating the economic rules of the fair game.
"This is a clear economic doping case both in terms of secrecy and the state," Javier Tebas, president of the Spanish league, told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the Qatari ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is also reluctant to state funding for the football team, which is owned by the American sports team.
"The incident is a result of ownership that has completely changed the football operating environment over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It is very difficult to follow the economic rules of the fair game. There are so many interests related to the fact that the famous player represents the state."
Now it's in a hurry: Finland's World Cup athletes coach trapped in Helsinki
Arttu Pajulahde and Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, although she should be coaching at the World Cup in London.
Kristina Mäkela may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the length jump and Mäkelä on Saturday in the triangle.
However, the two-man coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not obtained a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the matter at the British embassy without results.
The coach has an invitation to the organizers of the World Cup as a document, but it is also not eligible for a visa.
Is this the first symptom of Brexit, or what, said coach Jorma Kemppainen.
He has always handled the visa issues himself successfully in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for many years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone at the stadium looks at the footsteps, Arttu Pajulahti said about his coach's possible absence.
World Cup medal for FinlandLondon demands a miracle
The World Championships in general sports will begin in London on Friday and will last a fair week ending on Sunday, August 13.
General sports, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the species that Finnish bankers are passionate about from year to year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of athletes, success is measured in medals.
There are other gauges, of course.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from prizes to other, where the experience of acquiring a mature athlete’s performance to the level that the adult World Cup medal is truly possible.
There are no such young athletes in the Finnish small World Cup team, and yet there are no concareers.
The World Cup is a miracle for Finland.
Fortunately, the curiosity and surprise of sport is that even miracles can happen.
It attracts bank athletes to the TV area and glue them to follow the competitions, although the London medals are decided due to the time difference only in the evening.
In the previous World Cup 2015, Finland won one bronze medal.
It was brought to you by voter Tero Pitkumäki.
Believers are still waiting for a medal from Long Island, although the other is telling him and other casters’ recent results, as well as Long Island’s striving to stay on top of last summer’s awards.
Anyway, in these competitions, Pitkmäki remains a great Finnish sports hero in history.
For other Finnish athletes of the competition, access to the final competition or making their own record is a sufficiently good performance.
Hope and belief in the realistic medals of the Finnish public sport in the coming years will give good success in the international awards for young people this summer.
Improving the talents of young people and financial support for their work is more important than keeping a small elite team of professional athletes.
Success does not come in a moment, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both training and banking athletes.
Finns are also able to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully the London Games will remain in history as the contests of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, and not, for example, because of fear of terrorism or violent attacks.
Before Lake Rukaj for the second time in Copper's big air - "But it does hurt"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has been ranked second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
Copper Mountain is the best big air world cup in Lake Rukaj.
The women's competition was won by Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
He attempted his last jump in the cavalry 1080 for the first time in the races, and it was very close to succeeding.
It feels good and a good fit is now, but it’s a pity that the last jump didn’t go well.
I’m going to try it again in the competitions from now on, Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps for the species.
Viking Line launches new fast-track ship in Helsinki
The Viking's new fast-track FSTR is very late on schedule.
The fastboat had to depart from Helsinki to Tallinn at 6 p.m.
The ship was loaded in eight countries.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
I've waited at least 1 1/2 hours for you to get on the ship.
Now the carriage is moving a bit, the Estonian Johannes Rebane, awaiting the arrival of the ship in the port of Helsinki, said at 7:30 p.m.
Rebane thought the new ship had been technically flawed.
Rebane said the equipment company had brought water bottles waiting for the ship to enter its cars.
Viking head of the media, Christa Grönlund, told ISIS that there was a technical flaw.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Greenlund says the ship will also be delayed for a couple of hours after Tallinn’s return.
The ship had to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 20:15.

From the point of view, transport continues along Route 13 to the port of Mustola.
Little Circle of Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story encompasses both the days of the 80s and the grunge of the 90s (at that time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great sketch series for MTV) and his own time – in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, and others moved to a major career.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the continuous memory that we have experienced in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it already feels alive in its time.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (it was told, among other things, by the voice of H. Jon Benjamin as the backdrop story of the green stew).
The essence of the joke is that middle-aged actors are playing hippie teens approaching adulthood. Its emphasis makes some jokes about the impossibility of achieving the past.
The Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodies, for example, the '90s stalker leaflets, such as the horror film The Hand That Makes the Root.
At one point, one of the characters digs out Apple Powerbook, inline scrollers and "change the bad year of 1991".
Many stories are the same as before.
Goodbye Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer, but hasn't crossed Katiesta (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) as George H. W. Bush (who plays Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, side paths are the best.
It's especially fun to see Paul Rudd, who has a soul patch under his lip, Matt Dillon's "soul patch" for Singles. Andy, the camp's hero, is starting to be an old mom.
The moments of random insanity may take this series to flight as a kind of recursive series of Seven Up! until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends head for the first night of the film Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: The Americans' Cold War spirit, the Atomic Blonde movie, and even the GLOW-series' button screenplay, where it faces the West.
The comedy series, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, is directed by Rhys Thomas, and is a Romanian police drama of the 1980s, in which a Bucuresti couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The main characters, Gregorina and Iosefina, are Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici. Their turns have been translated into English by Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a great idea.
But there is not much more.
The series has some good visual jokes (the police spend time watching chess on TV the same way Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective gets too caught up in the imitation of the ugly socialist drama – for example, there is a killer hidden behind the Reagan mask, which is why the series often starts to feel like ugly propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough or abundant.
The series could work better as an agitprop satire, even when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the hall eating hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist public is that Western culture can make all the consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not mistaken: we have our own close-up history as well as their history as well.
Toni Tauru, a former UFC player, rises in a round in Macau on Saturday
Toni Tauru wants to keep the game up.
Toni Tauru gets a hard shot in Macau, as Brazilian Leandro Issa played in the UFC last year.
The Brazilian also has a black belt and a world championship.
I’m going to fight myself against my parents.
That’s a funny story, says 32-year-old Tauru.
He was supposed to be in Indonesia on Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three matches were scheduled for the Chinese autonomous region of Macau.
Tauru hasn't encountered any of these before.
This was the first time my appointment was cancelled.
It annoyed, because preparing and training took a lot of time.
However, the player is pleased that there is a new time for the game.
Waiting for a week doesn’t have much to do with preparation.
Transplantation does not affect the condition, as it does not occur immediately in a week.
You can get even worse if you’re exercising too much.
Tauru has faced several opponents in his previous fight, whose strengths are standing.
This time, the situation is different.
Daisa Kouvola is described as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive player.
I bet he'll come up with a hard one and try to take it to the carpet.
He's won the World Cup, so he's a heavyweight.
The previous match in the match did not go as planned.
Filipino Kevin Belingon hit Tauura hard at the corner of his eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I’ve never played so well, especially standing: he didn’t get any hits.
When I went downstairs, he hit me in the corner of my eye.
It's been hurting for a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the freelancers perform once a year, some grow into the circle more densely.
For example, the next opponent Issa played for the last time in September.
Last year, the club had three matches.
There is now a second battle this year.
Sometimes the pace has become heavy.
I’ve been training in the last few years and I’ve been in good shape all the time.
However, I've only been questioning for a while.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming meeting, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was training in Espoo and I got the joy of doing it back.
We had a really good workout with a friend from Sweden.
The training was a great help, as on Saturday the kouvolalayan will have to prepare for the physical battle.
I've been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice standing.
Being able to play is the main act of a 32-year-old.
You have to be smart.
If there's an opportunity, I'll take it myself.
Lower exports should not be given free of charge, as they are the most consumed.
Macao has already won the previous China-taken Tour.
It's Chinese Las Vegas.
I think there's a big and great night ahead.
The Bank of England has an interest rate of 0.25%.
The central bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates steady when economic growth has been effortless and inflation sluggish has stopped speculation about interest rates.
The central bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow, with the bank shifting interest rates due to increasing pressure on the level of income for families.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s monetary policy committee voted 6-2 to keep the interest rate at 0.25 per cent. The increase in the crown received even less support this month as economic growth has been effortless.
In its quarterly inflation rate, the Bank dropped its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 per cent and its 2018 forecast to 1.6 per cent. It also warned that the level of income for households will face even more pressures as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate at close to three per cent.
However, the Bank said interest rates are needed in the coming years to curb Brexit-driven inflation, and the Bank said that loan costs could have to increase more than expected on the financial market.
In addition, the members of the board decided to cancel part of the massive economic package, which began to be implemented a year ago in the wake of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to offer banks more than <0xC2><0xA3>15 million, or a total of <0xC2><0xA3>115 million, through the program.
The report of the Bank's interest rate decision states: "The Monetary Policy Committee predicts that the slow development of gross domestic product will continue in the coming years as the decline in real household income reduces consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated that in order to mitigate inflation, "some degree of tightening of monetary policy" needs market expectations "a little wider".
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that the possible increases are "stupid" and "rational".
In May, the Bank predicted a growth of 1.9 per cent for this year and a growth of 1.7 per cent for next year.
It now maintained its 2018 growth forecast of 1.8 percent.
The dollar and the euro fell as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound fell by 0.5 per cent and was <0x24>1.31. Compared to the euro, it fell by 0.4 per cent and was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.11.
The decision to maintain interest rates was taken after the expected low growth figures stemmed from increased expectations of interest increases, with GDP increasing by 0,3 % in the second quarter and by 0,2 % in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but to grow slightly at the end of the year.
Its recent inflation rate gave little hope to households suffering from accelerating inflation and small wage increases, and according to the Bank, the situation will deteriorate even before it gets better.
The bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" revenues from falling in the coming years, but it expects wage development to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be reinforced by strong growth in demand for British products as a result of weak pounds, which will cancel some of the impact of the decline in private consumption.
The decision was made a year after interest rates were reduced to 0.25 per cent after a shocking EU referendum result that dropped the pound.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to begin to appear in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Before the central bank’s most recent decision, interest rates had started to be demanded more and more loudly as inflation sparked pressure on households, with three decision makers demanding a rate increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation rose to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation will tighten again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, its 2% target exceedance was due to the "total" weak pound.
“Given the recent decline in swap interest rates, competition in the mortgage market would appear to intensify further as lenders are hotly seeking customers and wanting to end the year strongly,” says Andrew Montlake, Coreco Mortgage Brokers’ chief executive.
"Markets look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Renewal agreements are increasingly popular, their rates are low and there are also non-expensive options available."
NHS Prescribes 10,000 Controversial HIV Drugs
From September onwards, patients can be prescribed a "reversible" HIV test drug. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute concerning the financing of the drug in the UK's public health system (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Before intercourse with the drug, it has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86 percent in subjects at high risk.
The NHS agreed to finance the trial after the court held the Supreme Court’s last year judgment, according to which the NHS is able to pay for PrEP, even though it claims that local authorities should finance it.
Britain’s NHS chief Simon Stevens called the decision “a significant new intervention,” and the National AIDS Organization described it as “a crucial moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to receive applications for the trial, which will be extended to other clinics in October. The trial will reach its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is an HIV medicine to be taken before intercourse, which reduces the risk of infection.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in the risk groups.
Before sexual intercourse, the drug to be taken means that during sexual intercourse, the body has enough drugs to prevent HIV infection.
The medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender men, as well as people with an HIV-positive partner who is not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics select candidates from men, women, transgender and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People who live in England and have applied for general medical treatment can also apply for a test at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and the British NHS signed a procurement agreement this week following an international tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of the PrEP drug by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its allocation, withdrawal and treatment.
“This significant new intervention should complement and enhance existing, diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV,” Stevens says.
“This is yet another significant achievement in over 30 years of fighting to address the greatest health challenge of mankind.”
“This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” said Deborah Gold, the head of the National AIDS Organization.
“If PrEP is targeted correctly to those who need it and to those at risk, it can have a reversible effect on the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, those who are part of the risk group will receive a drug through an NHS-funded trial, which they can decide on their own without the need to negotiate with a partner. It has an enhancing effect, which will improve the lives of many people.
This was a welcome news.”
“The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and that no one in the risk group remains outside it,” said Terrence Higgins Foundation Director Ian Green.
“The PrEP drug to be used in the trial has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people at risk from HIV infection.”
“The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that has been extended in vain for several months as a result of the government’s slowdown,” Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the shadow government, said in a statement.
“We have evidence that the drug can have a reversible effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment helps us to better understand the real benefits of the PrEP drug.
Now it is important that experiments be launched as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has succeeded in stopping it."
Quality of life: the middle layer and smart interior solutions have made a small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Former banker Joanne Leigh moved from Knightsbridge's residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna’s stylish house of the era. The success of the renovation tells us that Joanne has not yet packed her baggage and has changed.
"Before this, I lived with my ex in a much larger apartment in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
“I’m looking for something similar in my price range.
I went here to the apartment desk and noticed that the rooms were as tall as in my apartment at the time.
I immediately fell in love and made an offer the same day.”
Since then, the 90-square-square apartment has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a duo where the bedroom could only be accessed from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor so that the height of the room could be exploited.
"I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands,” he says.
He hired a Duck & Shed design office in Erfan Azad’s Notting Hill. Erfan was assigned to take advantage of the space of nearly four meters high rooms and create an apartment that would be not only a place of repair and sale, but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for two oversized spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate layer where it could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
“The steel structures are quite complex.
The premises had to be arranged overlapping so that they did not need to be squeezed.
The structures had to be adjusted in such a way that the height is exactly appropriate both above and below them."
Erfan was able to place the space on top of two full-sized rooms with fascinating details.
On the middle floor, the copper cross window of Retrouvius opens into a stylish living room.
Exquisite furnishings, silvery effects and Serge Mouille vintage lights create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, sense of space and light.
Mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor look farther than it really is.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window that opens the view to the other room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne’s meals and glassware.
Stylishness is added by the fact that the kitchen gets hidden when not in use.
Kitchens equipped with artificial water are not a new solution,
but Joanne's kitchen is unique that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of design," Erfan says about the steel-resistant MDF door.
"It is balanced, that is, it slips very easily when lifting in place."
With a good use of space and the design of storage space, Joanne got an additional 16 squares, a second bedroom and an even better basic solution.
“When selling an apartment, the area solves – or the value of the property,” Erfan says.
"In the basic case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area."
In Joanne’s apartment, the area was added using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
“The resident is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotion of the apartment is partly based on them,” Erfan says.
“No one sticks to the electrical wiring that runs on the walls.
They are important, but not the same.”
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good design and extra beds can make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of your apartment.
Pregnant princess Sofia shines in her summer holidays
Princess Sofia's choice of residence hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in B<0xC3><0xA5>stad for the last time before her birth.
For the dinner of A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a bright blue outfit.
Sophia was smiling on the occasion.
Princess Sofia has visited this week in B<0xC3><0xA5>stad, Sweden.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia represented A Sustainable Tomorrow in a magnificent blue body-shaped suit that wore a magnificently pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue residential complex.
This is the last event in which Sofia represents before her birth.
Its calculated time is September.
For the dinner of the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel-yellow outfit that landed wonderfully.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish briefcase.
The pastel blue dress is great for the princess.
Sofia has been on a mission in B<0xC3><0xA5>stad, Sweden this week.
Sofia supplemented the living room with a small bow.
Sofia was directly radiant in her fresh summer holidays.
Sofia was excited about the event even talking to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said laughing and pointed to her final period.
He grows us with sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a house appeared on Lahde Square, where Thai food was sold.
The bakers did not dare to taste, but walked past.
In the kitchen, Panya Suamsri-Penttilä sold food, among the familiar ones of Panja.
He did not speak Finnish, and the Finns did not speak Thai at that time.
Because the people did not dare to go to eat, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the Bahá'í people to eat Thai food, the spring turtle at a time.
The country, he said.
I'm hanging out of the woods.
I went more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai restaurant in Lahti.
There were two small tables, I think the customer seats were less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a fan.
When you’re hungry and places are limited, you can’t leave an empty chair between yourself and the stranger.
We got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat next to the table with a dictionary learning Thai.
Two years went on the side of the mall, but then the restaurant had to change, because I heard the spices you made yourself smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was opened at the end of the shopping mall.
There's room.
Now we lawyers are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most pressing times we have to humbly ask the guests if there is room next door.
Panja knows his clients.
You will be told where you went and who you saw.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how the life stages of the customers vary and the food chain changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring rolls.
He remembers me slim and fat, and he remembers how I was when I was young.
It’s nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my own place next to the kitchen door and exchange belongings to the dishes with Panja.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our tastes, he has opened our thoughts and hearts.
Nowadays, many people speak Thai to him - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panjaya.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always been friendly.
He's tough.
He goes to the restaurant with mushrooms and blacks.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated its two-decade anniversary.
We, the customers, got a strawberry cake for dessert.
Without warning or attention, this important day went by, at work.
Discovery of an underground base reveals 173 ISIS terrorists who were ready to attack in Europe
Since the beginning of the year, the security authorities have received a list that is important for counter-terrorism work.
The list contains more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 individuals and the document contains not only their personal data, but also pictures of each.
More than 130 of the people on the list are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also included.
They are from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Evening-Sanomat told me about the list and a few weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have been refined.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi military special forces found a list of terrorists’ personal data and photos while investigating the terrorist organization’s underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence agencies assessed the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
Background was the fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by the terrorists in the Middle East when ISIS collapsed.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all persons, but also their date of birth, their invented alphabets and information about the person’s homeland.
The list also identifies terrorist specialties.
For example, the 27-year-old Sami J. on the list reads the battle name Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He is said to have left Germany in 2012, first travelling to Egypt, then through Libya and later through Turkey to join the ISIS ranks.
Next to her picture is a specialty suicide bomber.
There is no more accurate information about the man's fate.
In total, some 6,000 fighters from Europe have left the ranks of ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
Man slipped under the surface at Tokoinranna in Helsinki
According to the rescue agency interviews, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
It can also save the life of a drowning person.
On Thursday, a man was rescued in Helsinki’s Tokoinrand.
According to Ville Estlander, a firefighter at the Helsinki Rescue Agency, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The rescue submarine found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue agency received a notification after 4:00 p.m.
The person was delivered to the first treatment.
Estlander says it was about a 50-year-old man.
Based on the interviews, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranna is over.
Estlander thanked the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
This was the task of the Border Guard.
The locals also guided the divers excellently.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water along with the Border Guard and police.
Two passenger cars collided in Eura - in cars nine people, three seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the car, the rest of whom suffered milder injuries, the firefighter said.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the crossroads of three roads at four hours a day.
The collar occurred when another car turned the warning triangle in front of the other car, the firefighter said.
According to the rescue agency, the crossing area has a speed limit of 80 km/h.
Brothers fight for over <0x24>500 million in real estate
Two of the brothers dispute Victoria’s largest real estate empire, worth more than <0x24>500 million, and they are part of the Italian family who founded a family business 40 years ago.
Former Carlton football player and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Tooraki district just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has brought to the Supreme Court the dispute between the brothers about real estate and business property.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the divorce is bitterly disputed.
Together, the brothers and their mother, Anna, own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, and the family started accumulating property when they bought a store on Collingwood’s Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store, which expanded to 160 movements.
The chain was sold for <0x24>85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centers.
According to the agreement with the deceased father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul owns about a third of the company's fortunes.
According to legal documents, the share of the property means that Colin owns the properties for about <0x24>316 million and Paul for about <0x24>176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the division of property and money.
“I think Colin left the best properties in his proposal for himself,” Paul wrote in his first voluntary testimony to the court in 2015.
The case was dealt with for the first time in the Supreme Court on Friday after several mediation firms.
The brothers are also now arguing about who controls an existing business. Paul claims that Colin has shut him out of business.
Colin says the claim is not true, he's accusing Paul of mishandling some of the properties.
Colin writes in one of his first voluntary testimonies that he would like to find a solution.
"According to our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing to me," Colin said in a statement.
The cost of the case is constantly increasing. Alternative opinions, emails, and reports have hundreds of pages. The case is explored by consulting firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the country’s best and most experienced lawyers, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded dairy bars and delicacies in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a trade from Brunswick.
They were used as collateral for the family's purchase of the property from Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first jewelry store.
Colin says he founded the store "in the last years of the school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to move the property to their sons appropriately.
"Luigi often said that he did not want the brothers to end in court," Anna wrote in her statement.
The family's other two sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the business of the De Lutis Group. According to Colin, Mark received <0x24>10 million and Luke <0x24>26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "cattered by the economic conditions of their origin."
Colin has been low-profile, although he is a former board member of the Australian Football League and television star Eddie McGuire’s best friend, according to his 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lut and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied. He said in his text message that he could not comment on the matter correctly, because it is being dealt with in court.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to challenge me to court and bring our family by name to justice,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin continued, saying he continued to hope that the matter would be resolved.
On Friday, hope seemed to be gone.
"Our cases will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to restrict the president’s use of the media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
The first one.
According to Poltico, the White House’s new chief of staff plans to restrict President Trump’s use of the media and monitoring of the news so that the boss doesn’t get into trouble so often.
Reporter Josh Dawsey said:
“When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with executives on his first working day, he took the key issue he intends to solve: he intends to restrict President Donald Trump’s access to information.
Kelly told White House employees that all information – both printed and heard in the press – must be conveyed through her, because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.”
Kelly’s words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump’s use of the media and have failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television – and as president he still watches a lot of television.
“If Presidential candidate Trump was nervous about the misinformation, it would be helpful for him to show that the sympathetic media treated matters more equally,” Sam Nunberg, who worked as an advisor on the Trump campaign, told Politico in February.
At the time, Politico journalist Tara Palmeri wrote that, “according to the former campaign employee of the company, it is essential that Trump’s Twitter usage is controlled by a steady stream of congratulations to his personal media stream.”
All right.
But it’s ridiculous to say that Trump’s use of Twitter would never have been in control.
Maybe these campaigners know something that we others don’t know—perhaps Trump’s tweets would have been even worse without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump has left unsealed.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems at least a few times, their work has not been futile.
However, no one has been able to coherently prevent Trump from causing the uprising.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to drive their case by providing Trump with information that supports their views. That information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisors deliberately provide the president with questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher said of one case:
“Trump’s current and former employees say he can be extremely angry at the news outlets where he is criticized – especially if they tell him about malicious data leaks. Then he has to know where the data comes from.
That happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a copy of the news of GotNews.com, founded by the internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, accusing Katie Walshi of several White House information leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, and had previously spread false accusations and subsequently denied them, and he did not provide any concrete evidence.
"Trump had begun to read the story about Walsh, though."
Goldmacher added that then-Chef of Staff Reince Priebus and White House secretary of staff Rob Porter had “tryed to introduce a document management system for Trump.”
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same three months later.
He may turn out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump still has his own impulsive self and his assistants are still running his own business.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's task very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French football club PSG, according to AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million to FC Barcelona, a footballer in the Spanish league.
Neymar's deal with Barcelona was therefore broken, and he was free to move to PSG.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million transfer is the highest in football history.
The previous record was at Manchester United, which paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million to Paul Pogba last summer.
PSG is owned by state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The group is chaired by former tennis player Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen explored alcoholism and flying game hypnosis: "I'm fine with my life"
From the TV series Rusu time and Pure white blankets, the famous success writer Raija Oranen just celebrated her 69th anniversary.
Hypnosis helped Raja Orasta.
In addition to writing, five children love their grandmothers so much that Raija and her husband, Jyrki, abandoned the Spanish sun and the apartment in Fuengirola after 18 winters.
At first they sold their house, but now in the spring they also left the apartment for rent.
In light and in the sun, away from the old circles, Raijan sometimes took depression and alcoholism, which he has survived.
The exterior is 20 kilos lighter.
Weight dropped when serotonin drugs were discontinued, they were mood swings.
Alcoholism helped me sometimes with hypnosis, which also led to flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I'm better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who have worked in the tourism sector, have been working together for more than 40 years.
I got married, and it was to get married in two weeks, Ray laughs.
That's the kind of drama queen she's always been, quitting her life from that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
With only a good 44 pieces of Pure white sheets, Oranen remembers the TV series that touched and moved Finland during the Lama era.
I finally decided to become the clothing industry of a family company in France when I read a 50-year interview with Liisa Seppälä on the plane.
I was the babysitter’s daughter myself, my mother also had a dress business and sometimes I act as a mannequin, Oranen recalls.
From him, the story and the story of the series changed the Finnish attitude towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelaise’s research and claim revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer in active time, she has many scripts under work - hundreds of ideas.
The Tournaments Returned Over the Past to the “Millionaires’ Street”
The wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again wholesalers with self-centered tourists who managed to get past the time the municipality needed and return to the next-door plot.
The Rottolians parked their 20 trailers near a street called a millionaire jungle in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the fortress that was being hampered by the municipality, bringing with them children, horses and an army of wagons.
The Rottolians managed to cross the traffic jam that had been left unprotected because of the track.
Angered residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of "complete inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident tells us of Bentley Heath, who arrived on Monday night, where they had stoned passers-by.
“The customer has to be forced to act because he feels completely incapable of solving the problem.
The Tournaments were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them tonight, and probably even more tonight.”
The resident said the Birmingham municipality had solved the problem by banning access to parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay a municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the Rover returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than ever before, and they have even dropped a horse into the park."
According to the municipality of Solihull, the municipality is aware of the illegal camping in the vicinity of Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal measures with Solihull police to deter the campers as soon as possible.
For the collection of evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report to the police any disturbing or criminal activity.
It will help to create an overall picture of the situation for the purposes of legal proceedings."
Infuriated People Surrounded Portugal’s Destruction Car
In Portugal, men who were forced to go to a beach full of people have been interrogated in court today.
As a result of the compulsory bill, two people died yesterday.
Two men who flew the plane could be charged with death.
In Portugal, the longest possible sentence is 16 years in prison.
The men’s small plane was hit yesterday due to a technical failure on the coast of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of whom fled into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit the man who was in the back of the plane.
Immediately after that, the plane rose up and when it landed again, it hit the head of the child, told the Philippi Janeira Jornal de Noticias.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents weren't hurt.
On the beach, the people surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash in anger.
The girl’s father and other people went to the plane and started to hit it, Celia Rocha Correio da Manha said.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a wonder that no more people have died.
The two men on the plane were not injured in a forced carriage.
The Finnish star who tragically lost his leg won the World Cup gold again: "Without an accident I wouldn't be a world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated the Finnish time of the World Cup gold banked in slaloms in the competition held at Big White in Canada early Wednesday morning.
Big Hamari also won the World Cup in cross-country competitions.
All three World Cup titles have already accumulated.
Amazing World Cups!
Twice the gold was treated, with a pretty good heartbeat drawn, the Grand Hamar reached on the phone rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skipper thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Grand Hamar, the number of contestants in the species is growing all the time.
The whole paralysis industry has grown and evolved a lot lately.
Differences are diminishing, and there are a lot of new players involved.
I'm always wondering if a black horse should be backed up.
Every race seems to be a different winner.
Suur-Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had fallen enthusiastically from a young age with his friends, and the accident did not take the desire to get on the track.
Sometimes I think about what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it is useless to treat somewhere.
The cards are played, which is shared, the Great Hamar emphasizes.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and the loss of time a fortune, and Grand Hamar will not do so.
But he turned to karma for the benefit of difficulty.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned out to be a victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Prior to the accident, 23-year-old Grand Hamar’s largest ferry fleet was already depleted.
Towards the summit of Duun, the real factory did not start until after the accident.
When I was young, I trained with my friends, and we always lost our enthusiasm for the X-Games.
But they were distant dreams, which somehow faded over time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow from the start of X-Games.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a really long life if I stayed here to get interrupted and upset.
I decided to pull the sharks in the neck and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
Laskija was very pleased with the choice of wheelchair maker Leo-Pekka Star as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner was awarded in the sporting event held in January.
According to Grand Hamer, Star victory is an important signal for paratroopers.
It was a really big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will also open your eyes to the world of paratroopers.
When is the time to launch the World Champion Matti Grand-Hamar’s Sportsman of the Year campaign?
We'll see it in time.
I'm trying my best to succeed.
The Great Hamar has not yet conquered all the summits he longs for.
Next year there will be a big goal.
A year later, the Paralympic Games will take place in South Korea.
That’s where we go to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees roasting bread in refugee camps in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of ISIS from the country are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration does not see any change in the Syrian conflict.
The communication chain Burson-Marsteller examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth for nine years.
This year’s A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18-24, of whom half were women and half were men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42% of respondents may think that they are returning to their home country and 4% could not say.
According to the study, the most impact on the return of young people is the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in a permanent home invasion, while a quarter consider ISIS to be the most important factor in leaving the country.
Only less than one-tenth of them are the key factors in deciding whether to improve the economic situation or to leave Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action does not solve the conflict alone.
The Syrian youth were asked what was the most important factor in resolving the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more important than President Bashar al-Assad’s resignation from power.
A fair quarter considers al-Assad’s presidency an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Almost half feel that political and military solutions are needed to bring an end to the current Syrian conflict.
Only a fair quarter believes in solving the conflict by means of mere military action.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see ISIS power weakened over the past year, as a fifth experiences its power again strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and in general against terrorism, is that the media would convey to people information that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost the same number raised military measures as well as training reform as a primary means.
One-tenth of the fairness believes that the most important thing is to create jobs that are better paid for young people.
When asked about the Trump administration’s impact on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Almost one in four believe the Syrian conflict will worsen during the Trump era.
Opinions are divided on whether the participation of Russia and Iran has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the net in order - his databases are used for example by Wikipedia and Google
The company MariaDB is developing the "world's fastest growing" open source database.
The main product of MariaDB founded by coding entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius costs users nothing, and it can be developed online by any leading programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, the vast mass of data remains in order and quickly accessible.
For example, if you use LinkedIn, Twitter, or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
“All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are linked there,” Widenius explains.
Widenius, the technology manager at MariaDB, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who works remotely with beautiful hands cares that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world’s most popular open source database, MySQL, together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, Sun acquired MySQL for <0x24>1 billion, and a year later, software giant Oracle mined Sun for <0x24>7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
“They didn’t want to work for Oracle, which didn’t make a certain promise about the future of MySQL,” Widenius recalls.
He had already established a company at this stage, which began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life to die.
I hired Sunil’s top twenty developers to ensure that the continuity of the code is ensured by the same friends who created it.
Because MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
All I had to do was change my name.
The MariaDB Foundation was founded to monitor the freedom of code development.
"These verifications were not made during MySQL," Widenius shrugged.
Although many have heard about Widenius and the MySQL billion trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
“In recent years, our growth rate has been around 50 percent per year,” says Kenneth Paqvalén, CEO of MariaDB.
The growth-focused MariaDB does not yet make a profit, and Paqvalén is a slogan for the company’s characteristics.
In addition, he reveals that in the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive orders in the amount of EUR 20 million.
Because the database is free, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also assists in the exchange of databases, which can be a career of more than a year if the customer has used a closed database.
The switch from MySQL to MariaDB is instantaneously successful because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, are MariaDB’s paying customers.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, provide MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically distributes Linux operating systems to new users in distribution packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have connections to the largest pools.
“Our customers include the world’s largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks and even someone’s central bank,” says Paqvalén.
Database markets still dominate giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in their closed databases.
Oracle’s MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
While the research company Gartner says that the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, players like MariaDB are still worthless, albeit fast-growing synthesizers.
In the <0x24>50 billion database market, open source databases are not even above the billion.
However, the weight of open source code cannot be measured only in cash, as most users do not pay anything for this software.
Research company Gartner predicts that by 2018, companies are already developing more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been exchanged for open or at least started.
Large companies do not get new customers because most will choose the next open source.
This has led to the fact that license fees for commercial databases have jumped into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to with a smaller number of customers,” Widenius thinks.
Because the exchange of a closed database is difficult, the majority of customer companies have swallowed up the price at a glance.
“There are a lot of customers to whom switching is really difficult because their old apps and others are locked in a closed database,” Widenius says.
He still believes that the size of the customers is coming to an end.
As license fees increase every year, the customer moves sooner or later to an open source database.
The price is 10-20% from the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they want.
In addition, many companies are faced with major system changes when they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many switch to database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 million in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees globally and is now planning to hire more.
One reason for EIB funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example in the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually for databases.
“Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax revenues more efficiently,” says Paqvalén.
Widenius is concerned about how money is being wasted in Finland for even closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that open source is an ideology, but I think it’s a better way to make code.
The community helps and does something that it does not invent or is able to do.
Widenius, 55, is one of the most well-known promoters of open source, along with Linus Torvalds, another Finnish Linux developer.
Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models on an open source basis.
I still like 4-5 talks every year around the world on this topic.
Italy strengthens its attitude towards NGO rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs who rescue refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their activities unless they are committed to complying with the new rules on their activities.
“If NGOs do not commit to a new policy, it is difficult to see how they can continue to operate,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with La Stampa newspaper in Turin.
The warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated the ship of the German aid organisation Jugend Rettet, whose crew is suspected of cooperating with human traffickers, which promoted illegal immigration.
A year-long aid organization refused to comment on the detailed allegations made by Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartos.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only assess the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Iuventa launch of the Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken on board the ship by boats directly from human traffickers who were re-used.
One such case is alleged to have occurred only a few kilometres away from the Libyan coast, as shown in the prosecutor's document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of threatening the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area, and is believed to be motivated by the desire to help.
According to the operating instructions, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who oversees the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue activities have so far agreed to follow the guidelines: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
It said on Thursday it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable as they do not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organization's rescue operations.
Among those who refused to follow the guidelines are the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders.
Minnit, in turn, noted that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he considers is evidence that actions to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to produce results.
"In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that he planned to continue discussions this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects, as well as with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of being killed in open-air in Enontekiö, suspect found on the ground - case to prosecutor
The suspected crime occurred in Enontekien Kuttasa last December.
Police say a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing a 26-year-old Scotsman.
It was previously reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police said the suspect had fled to the country with two dogs after his actions.
The man was found cold from the ground, and he did not resist when he took hold.
The case must be filed in less than a week.
The case may be filed in the Lap District Court in August.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blooded Friends: Robert Hardy is Dead
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced by his family on Thursday.
Born in 1925, Hardy began her acting career at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also starred in films and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for the role of Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and for his role as a veterinarian in the TV series All Hairy Friends based on the book by James Herriot.
The BBC's most popular series was filmed through seven.
Michelle Carter has been sentenced to prison for instigating suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for texting and phone calls that she was believed to have incited her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months in prison and five years on probation.
Carter was sentenced to death in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at a hearing on Thursday.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for a change in the judgment and was allowed to wait for the application to be processed freely.
He was threatened with a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy were suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, wearing red pants and a cream-coloured pocket, listened to the judgment in her hands at the cross of a weeping gaze on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
“He decided Conrad’s life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act,” the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown remorse."
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was due to "concerning circumstances that Carter deeply regrets".
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, felt that Carter "did not have a significant effect on his actions at the age or maturity level, nor even on mental health problems."
The prosecutor read Conrad’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement in which she said, “It won’t take a day for me to mourn the death of my dear son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I can cope with all of this, and I try my best to comfort her sister in this pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister Camdy Roy told the court that she was "only" thinking that she would never see her brother's wedding and not be his aunt's children.
"It's painful to lose the person who has been in my life every day since I was born. That pain never swells," Camdy said.
The case appears to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car poisoning in 2014.
The incident attracted royal attention when it turned out that Carter had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Shoot yourself, jump from the roof, knit yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter took notice of Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter should not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the opinions of experts.
Only a few have defended Carteria. One of the defendants is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion paper, stating, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not jail."
NATO Secretary General: Russia's worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated sharply, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the Ukraine conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia’s eastern Ukraine region, NATO’s relations with Russia have deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid aggravation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, U.S. President Donald Trump said that the U.S.-Russian conflict was even dangerously bad.
Trump called on the country to thank the Congress for its bad turns, which approved new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi to make changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to car manufacturers’ impact
The day before Audi announced, BMW offered to update more than 350,000 car software.
The BMW CEO said the company believes "there are more sensible options than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including BMW's home town Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler said on Tuesday it was making changes to more than three million Mercedek engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies talked about the call back.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve their carbon emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are thought to cause cancer and asthma.
Installation costs for emission-neutral devices are rising, making it difficult for cars to price competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of being part of major car companies and avoiding problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes. Volkswagen installed scams in cars that reduced emissions in tests according to the regulations. In normal driving, the emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of Audi’s engine development department in charge of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could circumvent European emission requirements. The charge was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi’s investigation can significantly undermine Volkswagen’s position: a luxury car manufacturer’s share of Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuela’s Vote Begins Wicked Investigation, Major Protests
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the actual number of voters.
This is the unprecedented opinion of a company that has no role in the election result, Tibisay Lucenan, chairman of the National Electoral Commission, told reporters.
Maduro to End Crisis
Venezuela voted for a deputy in a controversial vote on Sunday to amend the country’s constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organised its amendment against the protests.
The opposition to Maduro has deferred its own protests so that they are underway at the time of its appointment.
According to the newspaper El Pais, national security forces began taking control of the country's parliament building on Wednesday night.
The teams are intended to ensure the safety of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence Lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Laventel had been reduced due to drought and disease-carrying insects, and researchers and farmers are eagerly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Laventel is directly at risk in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, which has led to a sharp decrease in the rainfall in spring and especially in autumn," says CRIEPPAM, a specialist in agriculture in Provence.
"This will shorten the lifespan of the lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small cages to the area that spread microbacteria."
It's hard.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly sought-after ingredient in fragrances and cosmetics.
“Instead of long stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or completely missing,” Chaisse says.
"In other words, the parts that contain essential oil are even less."
The solution is sought by improving irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying with a mixture of protective scissors and water. In addition, dryness is developed for more durable varieties.
Reporter's Murder Reveals Growing Threat in Mexico
The weekly edition of the Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the paper deals with the latest cases related to organized crime, corrupt officials and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists are encouraged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which one is safer: to leave the children at home or to take them to the delivery where the 2009 crane attack took place.
Security experts have written three words to the board in the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the journalists for names for each group. No evidence is needed, the findings and knowledge are sufficient.
The table contains names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being employed by governments or drug cartels, criminals who make the news of Mexico's chaos life-threatening.
Violence is uninterrupted, and more and more journalists are the subject of attacks. According to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been killed since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 acts under the protection of the federal government, as part of a series of attacks and threats.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, journalist and source of inspiration.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
She is deeply missed, even though she is present everywhere. The front of the Riodoce building covers a huge picture with Valdez showing the middle finger. The picture reads: "Justice". Thirty-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in t-shirts, with the t-shirts worn by the wigs, and the Valzimier worn by the wigs.
The meeting is held less than two months after Valdez’s death, and journalists discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
In 2010, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office was set up specifically for the treatment of journalist cases, but according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two charges have been filed so far.
Journalists' murders are rarely brought to justice, as are the thousands of murders per year related to drug trafficking and organised crime.
The Riodo journalists intend to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, despite their sadness and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security summit is of little use because the killers are unknown and there is no hope of justice.
“This meeting is a waste of time,” he says.
“We can’t trust anyone as long as we don’t know the cause of the incident.”
Valdez had left Riodoce in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had been driving his red Toyota just a couple blocks away when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The amount is supposedly related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove off Valdez's car and drove it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was killed by his wife and two adult children.
The rumors move quickly and freely roam in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is a mouse hurdle.
Sinaloa has been Mexico's bloodiest battlefield since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January, and competing groups want to fill the void.
On the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are shot dead every day, and the cemetery has the decorative two-storey cemetery buildings that are larger than many homes.
The coastal state is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez' murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a competing group that goes to war against Guzman's sons.
Guzman’s sons may have been shocked: suspicious gang members bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine arrived at the point of sale.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murders are seen as a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer be afraid for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up Riodoce with five colleagues. The paper's shares were sold at that time for <0x24>50.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with a drug problem,” Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine became aware of its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising volumes grew.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories in the newspaper that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her news coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez was awarded the International Press Freedom Award to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage to follow Mexico’s history of drug trafficking.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said, receiving the award from the Journalists' Committee on Protection.
The drug trade is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompevieto TV last October.
“The journalist must accept a task that falls to him – or act as a fool.
I don’t want anyone to ask me where I was when death was bathed in here—why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
The Riodoce staff need Valdez – a wizard who curses like a harbor worker. They need a friend who has always been hailed and advised. They need a teacher who knows how to cope.
They trusted in their routines.
He always used pancakes.
He went to the bar opposite El Guayabo and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines came to his destiny.
The death of a colleague has also led them to think about how they can best do their job and survive.
“Criminals don’t like it when we talk about their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug trafficking scams.
They were left out of the case,” Bojorquez said.
It meant, at best, strong self-esteem and self-defense.
Confidence in your instincts.
If you feel like you're not all there, you have to stay away.
The problem is that, according to Riodoc journalist Andres Villarreal, "the impression can be deceiving, and so happened in the case of Javier".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak offices and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought to the room where Riodoce security training was held. A few days earlier it had become apparent that only government-sold espionage programs had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two policemen had applied for protection in the shade of a tree from a 40-degree helm.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce’s premises, located in a four-story building in the middle class area of Culiacan.
Some of the journalists calculated half of their play whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not consider reliable.
It had been months since the journalists had visited drug traffickers in a mountainous countryside.
This week's issue of Riodoce's delivery consisted of three main draws.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government’s spending was focused on the governor’s hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan’s most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the prosecutor’s office, was kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information on who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling institutional revolutionary party (PRI). PRI has governed Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
The governors involved have recently been charged with corruption in cases that have received a lot of publicity.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid the army's fury.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they had received reliable information from the Valdez column about the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says Villarreal, 46, who has been given the nickname "El Flaco" because of his body structure.
"Now all connections to our data sources are gone."
Valdez’s workplace has been transformed into a warehouse where journalists are kept with scissors and posters, and the magazine’s employees have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become activists for freedom of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few colds with him the next morning in front of the local prosecutor’s office for a demonstration, which again caused the murder of a new reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after Valdez's murder.
After the murder, a burnt body was found, which was Adame based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities.
Journalists have started to protest louder throughout the country. Protests on the pedestrian corridors and buildings will appear texts "SOS Press".
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he tries to get international support for Valdez's investigation.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has subsequently requested that he be removed from government affairs because he is concerned that hate cannot be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists were surrounded by organised crime, the authorities permitting crime, and a society that does not care.
In his last book, Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs are killing journalists, but they are also killed on the orders of politicians and security forces in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Article 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were by police and authorities.
“In Mexico, people are being silenced by killing,” Ramirez says.
The murder has a disastrous effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern Tamaulipas border state six years ago.
With his body was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my writing."
He had a computer keyboard and headphones next to his cut head.
Some of the newspapers have decided to stop working, such as El Norte newspaper in northern Chihuahua border state, following the assassination of Miroslav Break.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredo El Manana, although its leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to drug cartels on its homepage: “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
It's a tough decision.
It is difficult to find a job in the countryside, and it is always necessary to be careful.
At times, criminals search for a journalist in their hands, as apparently did photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in an apartment with four women in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was supposed to be a poet at the time, admits that writing about drugs is scary.
“I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he says.
Some time ago, on Friday afternoon, Riodo’s reporters sat in front of the delivery with a beer on foot, when the magazine’s latest issue had been completed.
19 people were killed in a shooting between competing gangs and security forces at the beach resort of Mazatlan.
The war was accelerating, as promised by the cartel’s messages found in the area.
Reporters posted the news on Riodo's website via their smartphones.
The front page had to be redesigned the next day.
The sirens floated in the vicinity – another shooting.
Bojorquez looked at the security guards of the shipment:
If they were afraid, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the tradition of the newspaper's murdered founder under this massive portrait, where the man shows the middle finger to the entire Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says that you can't even think about quitting. "How could I quit the magazine when our trainee asked to go to the street to do something the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Mannisen's Olympic project started with a huge backbone - "Tough place"
In April, the celebrations of Hannu Mannis, who turned 39, were short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began catastrophicly when Manninen became ill with the flu.
This was the beginning of a long period of illness that lasted almost five weeks.
In May, she was almost completely ill.
At first there was a flu and finally a childhood disease such as ear infection, which I had to eat antibiotic cure.
I was able to do only 10% of the planned exercises.
I don't remember the last time I was hurting for so long.
It was a tough place when I didn’t get to take advantage of the exercise, Manninen tells Itta-Sanom.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion was granted an internship licence only in the second week of June, as seen in the KIHU’s Race and Top Sports Research Center on June 12th.
In the test, the athlete skis with skates on a carpet, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete’s fingertips.
Last fall, I played 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I'm only 28 minutes left.
It came against the wall, Manninen said.
Towards a better direction
After the initial rights, Manninen says he will stay healthy.
I’ve done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises with which I’ve tried to normalize the body’s metabolic process.
There’s a really good five-week period behind us.
There were also two and a half weeks of flight hours.
I also want to go to the cottage with my family.
Last season Manninen only participated in four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup home games.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening competition when Manninen rose to 18th at the top speed.
Guidelines drawn by
Manninen and head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm of training compared to last year.
After the first race, Ruka will have a weekend of three World Cups.
In December, at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau, is expected to be in attendance.
At the end of January, the plans would still be included in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that the name will be found on the Olympic team's list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would already be the sixth Winter Olympics for Mannis.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City in 2002, the gold team race celebrated a numelic underline.
Dinosaurs protect themselves from their enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary bat.
Now researchers have revealed the first findings of a Canadian miner's discovery of a cornea-sized creature that had been so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that researchers were able to even determine that its oral skin was reddish-brown and had a "problematic past".
According to the journal Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the best of its kind in the world.
The newly discovered fossil is a nodosaurus, which was found 110–112 million years ago during the Middle Ages.
Researchers consider this astonishingly well-preserved fossil to be a really significant discovery.
According to National Geographic, armored vegetation is the best-preserved fossil of all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn’t seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to study his findings more closely.
The fossil found on the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
There, fraud was excavated for six years from a 1,100-kilogram block.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
"If you close your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says Caleb Brown, a scientist working as a researcher at the Tyrrell Royal Museum.
It remains in the history of science for the dinosaurs Mona Lisana, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Skin research found that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, although it had a tank and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor masked it from predators, and it was also protected from a darker and lighter coloring that still occurs in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to interfere with its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old nodosaurus rose to the titles in May and is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrell.
According to Mark Mitchell, a museum technician named Mark Mitchell from Borealope, Mitchell was part of a team that took more than 7,000 hours to discover a dinosaur.
The Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine the shape and shape of its body’s lungs and tanks.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by common coloring, where the body is darker on and lighter on.
The observation was still a surprise, as the Boreal apple is significantly larger than the present animals with the same coloring.
It can be concluded that the meat-eating dinosaurs captured it to the point that evolution favored hiding as a means of survival rather than fighting.
For example, today's animals have a similar coloring, which is considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
“The capture of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the constellation were,” Brown says.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the nodosaurus lining reveals that its skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its intestine to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell into the river when it died and sailed into the sea, where it sank behind its back on the seabed.
Alberta was as warm as Florida at the time, and rivers and seas were likely to extend far beyond what is now.
“This nodosaurus is really significant because its oral skin has survived and it has also survived in its original three-dimensional form,” Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early conjunction period.
It does not require much imagination to figure it out: if you sigh a little, you can almost believe it was sleeping.”
The allied era was the age of the teropods, the giant bipedal dinosaurs that eat meat.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, millions of years ago the Boreal Peninsula, its mighty predecessors may have captured this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in the journal Current Biology. They believe that the Boreal apple rinsed into the sea after its death and mummified into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world’s best-preserved armored dinosaur from its leather and armor to its heel.
The Nodosaurus were on average five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two half-a-meter-high peaks rose from their bases.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetable eater passed through present-day Western Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its tanker has kept small details in a marine grave.
Its fossilized residues have been so well preserved that its skin remains in the tank’s shell-shaped discs along its neck.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such a stay is "as rare as a lottery win.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
Its calopansari's shell-shaped discs still contain fossilized leather.
Its right front leg is on its side, five legs upwards.
I can also calculate the footprints of the foot.”
How did an activist learn to answer the question: to whom do the streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from his home in St. Louis and sat in his airbnb apartment on his bed browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his reader:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information in his feed, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from <0x40>TheePharoah.
The name of the user belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted in real-time about Michael Brown's death after a white police officer shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user also posted a picture of Brown’s dead body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
“This is incredible,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter the same night, people were told to gather at Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police straps and screaming people, as well as Brown’s father, a man who claimed to be himself, who was wearing a blanket read: “Ferguson’s police just killed my unarmed son!”
Ferrell followed a real-time video of police standing in front of the protesters with a dog whispering.
He says he also saw a video in which another policeman twisted his gun and shouted, "I will kill all of you...the animals."
“This is not normal,” Ferrell recalls.
“It wasn’t a murder that we’re already used to and that could be called typical.
At that time, I felt cold colors.
I was angry and I was crying.”
He booked the return home for the next day.
The plane landed at eleven o'clock in the evening, and Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from his father and decided that they would leave for Ferguson the next morning.
From what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years, the documentary film "Whose Streets?" was released in theaters on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story about survival and expression, love and loss, and strength and blindness from the perspective of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson's flower dress and a crown compatible with it with his daughter, they went back to a conversation about "what it's like to live in black and in what conditions." They had spoken about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers what she said to her daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't have been without my daughter," Ferrell said later.
"The events of this day are... the culmination of the events of the past.
My daughter has the right to know it and to grow up in it.
He must be prepared for activism and organization, but he must also know the different layers and conditions of the experience of life as a blackout, and he must know what we need to do to be freed, to be freed.
Although fortunately, I have been able to protect her from racist bullies, she is still the same as the other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from the reality.”
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, opposite the police station, which became a camp for activists as they waited for information about the case and finally learned that police would not be prosecuted.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunch into bags and distributed it to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take on activism in a new way.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the organization of minority nursing students. At that time, she focused on food law and health services.
“I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, the documentary’s assistant director in the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "simply wanted to tell" what was going on.
Ferrell was suspicious and asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
On the basis of suspicion, they were countless times when people, usually white, appeared in the local community, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and cynicism.
“We’ve heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not have a common voice,” Folayan said in an interview recently. “We wanted to do things differently.”
Folayan had already contacted Assistant Director Damon Davis, known for his activism among convicted prisoners.
Davis's involvement led Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals. The film crew followed the events of Brown's shooting in the years that followed.
“This is not a document where someone is talking to us or talking for us, but we are talking,” Davis said.
“The most important thing for me was how local people are portrayed in the movie because I’m portrayed the same way.”
According to Folayan, it was not intended to focus on Ferrell's experience, because it was intended to show that the movement was "not a charismatic leader, but a community".
Therefore, the documentary sees surprising private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
“I felt a bit naked,” Ferrell laughs, telling me what it felt like to see the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the humane depiction of blacks requires a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats and brings back the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was created on social media (<0x23>BlackLivesMatter) after police shot Trayvon Martin, a black teenager, in 2012.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement up," says Ferrell. "It's because we have to constantly fight on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement is really maintained by black women, among whom there are a lot of queer women."
However, he stressed that Ferrell was not chosen to the document "self-intentionally" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy on the move," Folayan says.
"It's no coincidence, however, that he was at the forefront. Black queer women live on a lot of things at the point of surgery, and they have a lot in play.
His energy is transmitted from the white fabric.”
The news groups have long since left Ferguson, but the community and the police are still tense.
Ferrell has two and a half years left on parole, and he was convicted of blocking highways in a protest.
His description of the social-political atmosphere of his corners is brief and core: "Sekasotku."
Yet he still trusts in the assault he learned from outside the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
“We are committed to fighting for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our neck.”
Probability: Artist Creates Portraits of Chelsea Manning’s DNA
At the Fridman Gallery in New York, there is a showroom with faces - white, black and brown faces, between which you can see the likelihood in more detail.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning’s pocket and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he executed for 35 years and was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic e-mails to WikiLeaks.
The Dewey-Hagborg A Becoming Ressemblance exhibition was opened on August 2, 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and arts in his work. Manning is a transgender and career-oriented dissident, whose sentence on the day of imprisonment was lightened by Barack Obama.
Dewey-Hagborg algorithmically analyzed Manning's DNA and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data, which are a sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical, approach to DNA's variability, complexity, and interpretations, and the underlying cause and consequences.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly told women that he has been identified since the breakup, and was found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013, including spy rape, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning, who was sentenced to prison: a bright, black-and-white selfie, where the troubled Manning sits in the driver’s seat in the car, with a platinum-white wig at his head, which became his badge.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was behind the popular Stranger Visions project, which he implemented in 2012.
There, he created portraits based on criminal data, obtained DNA data from, for example, tobacco smokes and turkeys, and created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey-Hagborg told reporters.
He was unable to visit Manning and could not be photographed in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if he was interested in making a portrait of Manning’s DNA.
The artist and his captured mummy suddenly became letters exchangers, who wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even together produced a series of Suppressed Images, which was illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, depicting a future in which the president would have eased Chelsea's verdict and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shortened Manning’s sentence just a few days after the cartoon was published, which was a lucky coincidence after seven years in prison.
It’s also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now, as Donald Trump goes into his own war against information smugglers and transgender soldiers and invents new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful tribals he was actually supposed to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that “everything has a purpose.”
On the wall of the gallery there is an artist's statement and under it a large title inscription by Manning, where the point of the surname i is the heart. In his statement, the artist calls for the end of "the automatic division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture are based".
On the opposite wall there is a section of Manning's DNA: a long sequence of C, G and A letters written with a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotide, as an artist’s scientific definition includes – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least from our biology.
“I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are genetically equivalent and that gene information is very personal and open to interpretation,” says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also features his 2007 video edition of Spurious Memories.
"DNA tells countless stories, 30 of which are on display."
The last work of the exhibition is in his own room: a page from the comic book by Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
That's where Manning's character rises out of prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
"If they get you quiet, they've won," the picture says.
"Never shut up."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
Unlike what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he is greeted with his own gene-based faces as a group of protesters in the middle of the exhibition room.
It is intentional, like all the others in this exhibition: for example, Manning’s DNA section is written with a pencil at a height equal to its length (157.5 cm).
“They used to be on the wall, but I wanted to make them feel like a crowd,” says Dewey-Hagborg.
“I wanted to portray Chelsea’s mass movement, which was also behind his release.”
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University Employee Suspicious of Murder
Police say they have launched a national search to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is suspected of murdering a man in a Chicago luxury apartment.
Cook County court documents reveal that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathe, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being shot several times.
According to a local statement released by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police alerted the Grand Plaza apartment building to find the victim, who had several stab wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the cartridge is being investigated for murder, with police actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been working as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
University Deputy Director for Social Relations, Alan K. Cubbage, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now administratively free and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
“This is a criminal case that is being investigated by the authorities, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation,” Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a parent as an assistant in financial management at the University of Oxford.
In an email from the University and Somerville College informant, the statement reads, “We have been in touch with the police in the UK and are ready to help the investigative authorities in the United States in every possible way.”
In addition, the statement said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of information at the Chicago police station, said he was urging the suspects to seriously surrender to the authorities.
“The police have a sense of where they are, and we are constantly refining our search,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are assisting in the search for the suspects.
He told the police that he had received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described it as awful at the scene.
According to Guglielmin, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza management team published the following statement to residents: "The police are currently investigating the course of the events and the victim's background, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
Man Threatens to Blast Islamic Libraries and ‘Kill Muslims’ in London
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," the defendant told police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced for threatening to explode an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent newspaper, David Moffatt was convicted of violent harassment.
According to police, the bookstore staff alerted them to the scene on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had “threatened to explode the bookstore and kill Muslims.”
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was arrested when he called the police about a threat.
Threat was not associated with bookstore events.
Authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same suit as the book store suspect, a police spokesman said.
“I’m not an anti-Muslim, I’m a Catholic,” Moffatt told the police during interrogations.
As a punishment, the man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay <0xC2><0xA3>620, which is about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>690, and <0xC2><0xA3>85, which is about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>95, compensation to the victims.
According to Scotland Yard, a number of hate crimes are left unreported.
"We will complete the actions under the WADA map in the near future" – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the actions under the WADA map of the World Anti-Doping Agency, which will restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency.
"Some of the measures under the map have already been implemented, and RUSADA has been given the right to design and test in cooperation with the UKAD of the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA map has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap, which sets out the conditions for the restoration of RUSAD’s powers.
According to the report, it does not contain anything of concern to Russia.
“Everything has been announced, and everything is being done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future,” Mutko added.
However, one of the points of the map requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the results of WADA's study by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which McLaren is investigating the state's alleged role in Russian sport doping.
Mutko said: “The investigation is underway because our anti-doping system has conceded a failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programs, and we can’t allow for something that didn’t exist.”
In the words of Mutko, it was all about the opinion of Vitaly Smirnov, the chairman of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Earlier on the same day, Smirnov, speaking to the Russian sports media RSport, admitted that there were problems with the Russian anti-doping regimes. "We have said several times that there are controversial positions and regulations in the report.
We will not accept the report on conditional terms," he added.
WADA ordered RUSAD to end doping control in Russia in November 2015, after the extent of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, it was authorised last June to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, Olivier Niggli, the head of WADA, visited RUSADA’s headquarters in Moscow. After the visit, he noted that the organization is “on the right track” towards the restoration of powers.
British Association skeptical of Finnish love for innovation: "There is no evidence" of the health benefits of maternity packages
The British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packaging.
Among other things, the BBC and the Guardian say that the Lullaby Trust, which fights for covert deaths, prohibits the use of its own brochures in UK-distributed motherboards.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
Packaging is also distributed in some parts of the UK.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity pack reduces the risk of constipation.
Clutching means the unexplained sudden death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert of the UK health authorities in the field of safe sleep for children.
We will no longer allow to pack our official leaflets into them because it would allow you to understand that we recommend this product, the organization informed.
Finland has one of the world’s lowest child mortality rates, with only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to Lullaby Trust, a good reading in Finland is the result of many different reasons, such as the small number of teenage abuses.
The fact that there is a box given to each family may be one factor.
However, this cannot be said for certain, said Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packs are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and concealment deaths.
Maternity packaging is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package includes a variety of accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The package itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust, in turn, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a place to sleep.
According to Lullaby Trust, the packaging may be the best option for a sleeping place if there are no beds or beds available.
The organization recommends that the pack be used only for days and that it be discontinued when the child is able to turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pets away from the packaging and ensuring that they do not rinse or dirt.
The Horse Escapes from the Japanese Zoo
A Japanese zoo crew is looking for a turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff with its speed and has been able to do so within two weeks.
The girl fled the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the horse left the zoo through the entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo, said.
The 35-year-old karna is feminine, 55-kilo and about a meter long.
Yamane describes the escape as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the barn can walk freely in the area of the barn.
The zoo has not received eye-catching tattoos from the turtle.
Konna's previous escape took place the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along a path 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These Startups Help Your Business Avoid Uber Errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
The responses were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
While he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some of the employees treated them suspiciously.
"The surveys were simply not consistent and not objective," Errett says. Madison Reed focuses on the online store as a hair care company. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to rely on outside help.
More and more new types of HR startups have come to the market, helping other companies to figure out how their employees are.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target them to specific teams and population groups, as well as provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with the senior management.
"Your health can be monitored with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where will Fitbit be delayed?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Redwood City's Glint startup. Glint provides companies with analytics software to scale employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint’s software for three years, and he says he’s got a deeper insight into his employees’ thoughts and feelings.
The program can make quick surveys and votes for certain teams. In addition, it can create a map, which one can see at a glance, which departments the employees are most dissatisfied with and which of the managers have received the lowest ratings. Based on these surveys, Errett may have problems with the
Companies have understood that they have to follow the workplace culture so that they do not become the next Uber. The transportation company has been stifling since the former employee wrote about the culture in his blog, where employees are being bullied and talking about problems.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance is a global business that, according to Let’s Talk Payments, could grow to over <0x24>118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps businesses detect and prevent misuse. Interest in the company grew earlier this year as Uber’s reputation collapsed.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows businesses to make customized queries, collect answers confidentially in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by text message.
And if there is reason to suspect the manager of the inaccuracies, the complaints will go directly to the company’s government.
“The public opinion has ruled out the authorities,” said Convercent’s founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
He reminds that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be expensive even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start to boycott the company, and it can also lose employees and be challenged to the court.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the operating principles and procedures and are easily connected to its headquarters.
Previously, the practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out the phone number or email address that he was able to make a notification to the headquarters. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
“It was often a scary and unpleasant experience,” said Ruby Tuesday’s attorney general, James Vitrano, who said the complaints made by employees were difficult to monitor.
In the past, problems were hidden from managers working in another city or state, and problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can now be detected and managed more quickly.
“I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the employee’s reality,” says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"By the same token, we protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement even more seriously after the collapse of the audit firm Arthur Andersen as a result of unethical activity in the context of the Enron scandal.
It was only through social media that the companies realized that they could no longer prevent their scumbags from being publicly clarified.
“Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics,” Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is charged on a regular basis.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by equity investors, with both Glint and Convercent supported by equity investors.
In February, Convercent raised <0x24>10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising a total of <0x24>47 million in capital.
Glint received <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of <0x24>60 million.
Investments are not a surprise given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to a number of studies, employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In a competitive market like the Hiila Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
“Employees are more committed to the company’s success if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding,” said Nina McQueen, LinkedIn’s director of employee rewards and well-being.
Investors get profits when companies are successful. Companies are successful when employees are committed.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employees’ commitment, so it’s no wonder they’re interested in investors.
According to experts in the workplace culture, knowledge about employee engagement is important,
but it is useless if there is no action on this basis.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it may be considered a sign of change.
And if the change doesn’t come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
“If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be ready to have 4,000 discussions,” says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, a consulting company that has seen companies rely too much on mere information.
"If the company does not take action, the employees start to wonder if they have been heard.
and whether their opinions matter.
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting monthly staff surveys and is able to cope with the problem on the same day as reported in Glint.
When Errett had collected feedback from frustrated employees on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to make changes to teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees even better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve the durability of staff in the long-term industry, known for the high volatility of employees.
“If the company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose its employees,” Vitrano says.
“If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
“Without customers, there are no businesses.”
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of hiding his naked neighbor, according to the news agency TT.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of the shower when she noticed a mobile phone swinging outside her window at the end of the door.
According to the woman, the cell phone camera was photographed in the apartment.
The woman, who was stunned by the incident, had run into another room to dress up.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had first been pulled up, but soon afterwards had been recalculated to the window again.
The 20-year-old suspect has admitted to having photographed a woman.
He said he only painted a woman’s face.
The video on the phone had been removed, and the police had not been able to return it to evidence.
In the hearings, the man has confessed to the crime, but denied committing it.
The man described was justified by saying that he loves his neighbor as "very crazy."
According to TT news agency, the man will be charged with the case.
Teachers demand more rest in the autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, in the export industry, but the difference should be reduced, Olli Luukkainen, OAJ chairman, said on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public holidays underscores the difference, he notes.
We do not have the opportunity to enter into agreements where the review would in no way involve holiday cuts.
In the municipal sector, agreements will be concluded only after private sector securities have been signed and increases are cleared.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ’s working conditions have been agreed in January.
Percentage targets Luukainen hasn't been revealed yet.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, a public-skilled negotiating organisation.
Luukkainen: Vacancy cut increases earnings development gaps
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts indicate that the purchasing power of public sector employees is declining, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukka, a periodic holiday cut further sharpens the gaps in earnings development.
In Finland, it is necessary to define how many students per teacher can be
In addition, OAJ notes that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the most disadvantaged are constantly increasing.
According to the organization, learning outcomes are declining, and disparities between students and regions are steadily increasing.
Bruins' Players' Day was a long time ago when NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
A group of UCLA American football players have left to talk on the other side of the campus's new training grounds.
Some of them have cleared their shirts, and their backs glow with sweat after the first day of training camp.
For many of them, this few minutes of conversation is a midday break.
After three hours of training, the students will return to their home to read the final exams, and the next morning they will meet at the Wasserman Football Centre at 7:30 a.m.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's shift to Tuesday.
The University Sports Roofing Organisation reduced the number of daily workouts from one to two. The change was intended to reduce the number of players’ work, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final tests will be held.
That’s why UCLA’s first three exercises started at more than seven nights, and it was difficult for players to find a place.
Limiting training sessions to one day means that there are more training days than before. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in six months of Mora's training with the Westwood coaching season, when the training sessions are held at the same time.
Exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before the 20th of August, when the actual preparations for the opening of the season will begin: UCLA will meet with Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says he supports the NCAA’s change of rules, although it has made players’ schedules even tighter.
“We’ve been loading them a lot for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think it's going to be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises outside the camp. It is not easy given the direct view from the training field to the nearby parking area and Luskin Center, a high-level hotel already bombed behind the paintball squad with flying soccer.
Bruins players are due to relocate to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
“We have security arrangements,” Mora says.
"The problem is that people can book a room and film exercises from there for the video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
Exercises taken from the video cost a lot.
But we have guards in there and in the parking lot.
We're doing our best.
I'm not gonna bother my head too much.
We have a plan."
Freedom in Rwanda
Presidential elections in Central African Rwanda will be held on Friday, the winner of which is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially aiming for his third season, but in practice he has been influential in the country's leadership since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group RPF stopped the organized extremist genocide.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagamea has been criticized, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of speech.
He has also been accused, for example, of misrepresenting poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to make an effort because the constitution, which was limited to two terms by the Presidency, was amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuine leader.
During his time, social reforms have been undertaken in Rwanda and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting the country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has also promised his people more freedom after the country has risen to its feet.
Now could be a good time to start.
Facebook Fights Fake News by Enhancing Fact Check
Facebook intends to send potential fake news to increasingly independent fact-checkers and present the results under the original article, the world’s largest social network announced on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using up-to-date machine learning to identify falsehoods. Any falsehoods will be sent to fact-checkers and the results can be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being the largest spread of lies, and many believe that the lies influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has been raised in a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed with lies before the May presidential election and Germany, which is preparing for the September election, supports a plan to blackmail social media if they do not remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement in Germany that it is attempting to verify the facts in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“People want to see what stories don’t pass through the tracks of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so they can decide more clearly what they’re reading and sharing,” Sara Su, Facebook’s product manager for the news feed, wrote on the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the article-related feature and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Cartoon: The Story of a Castle
Little Castle in Kent County is now known for Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of stormy history, and now this charming castle in the Bewl River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, an old-fashioned moppiy-haired writer.
“It’s great for me to study the text written by a deceased over 300 years ago,” Rhodes said.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand."
Rhodes's book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Eduardian era. Each story has been illustrated by a different artist, promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book based on archives. In 2014, he appeared in Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose inspiration was documents from the British National Library. The project was timely.
"When I saw the letter in tears, I noticed a thumbprint. The letter had been written by a dual agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 17th century," Rhodes says.
“It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smelled like smoke, because at that time lighting was used as fire.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
“I love the archives!”
The author of the old documents was able to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Council of Arts of England, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he did not malt immediately to be in the castle for a little longer than had been desired.
He spent days exploring Victorian "new" castles, archives, treasures and rarities, such as wall-hanging hyenas and centuries-old bottles.
He wandered through the ruins and ruins of the old castle and discussed with forest guards, gardeners and sometimes even imaginary artists.
In the evening, he “took a whiskey and started writing.”
Scotney's close history is rather unknown, as the castle moved entirely to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of her last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the foundation’s staff was just beginning to go through the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives were held for hundreds of years by the same method: by taking all the extras to the roof.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the times of the English Empire, and maps of who owned anything. "You could imagine that landscaping is boring," says Rhodes. "But here the families fought even from one pond.
I thought we shouldn’t have already.”
Some of the stories of the book progress from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It relates to a man who soon after the completion of the castle relates to the English farmhouse in 1381.
“Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that the castle was in ruins in 1380,” says Rhodes.
"The English peasantry began in the same area, and it came to mind that the uprising could start from the mob.
Maybe these events are related to each other?”
Other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of a priest who was hidden by Darrell’s family for seven years during the purge of England’s religion.
The Smuggler tells the story of the 17th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the ark with stones (it was noted years later when his funeral was opened).
Darrels are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The family's men seem to have been pretty cowards. They were constantly in debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family would solve their debt problem by marrying rich old women, and I see them as nice friends who were able to lead the heirloom."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Life Mountain, a nursery that operated at the beginning of the 20th century, of which only a dirty plot is left.
The Castle of Scotney has a special place in his heart.
“It was sad to leave,” he said.
"I didn't want to go back to this evil coffin."
Russia's worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated sharply, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the Ukraine conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia’s eastern Ukraine region, NATO’s relations with Russia have deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid aggravation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, U.S. President Donald Trump said that the U.S.-Russian conflict was even dangerously bad.
Trump called on the country to thank the Congress for its bad turns, which approved new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko ends rematch against Anthony Joshua
Long-term World Heavyweight Champion Vladimir Klitshko will end his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Klitshko played as a professional 69 times, winning 64 games.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000–02 and 2006–15.
Klitshko lost his career in the last two games.
Tyson Fury hit him in the spots in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a hurricane match in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshkin were expected to meet in a rematch in Las Vegas in November.
However, Klitshko did not find any motivation for the party.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley trial, Klitshko said in his statement.
As an amateur and professional wrestler, I achieved everything I imagined, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful punch ball.
I'm very grateful for that.
Check out Klitshko’s explanations for his decision in the video.
Klitshko’s manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to terminate was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Mr Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettier since 2009.
The couple has one child, daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitshko’s older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008–12, the brothers ruled the World Cup titles of different leagues at the same time.
Finnish weather wreck: "Get out of the filly"
Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer outdoor season.
Minna Nikkas has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken the woman from the philippines.
Even at the London World Cup, there are unstable conditions.
Nina Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
The circumstances have been a stronghold this summer against Minna Nikka.
"I wouldn't blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I didn't get even the little helmets to move properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I’ve competed and practiced here knowing how many times and I’ve never experienced such a varied wind in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
During this period, it has been really difficult to standardize the jump, even when there have been so volatile winds in the exercises, Nikkanen said in the competitions Kaleva.
The weather was also in London on Thursday.
It's too challenging to get the technology out there - whether it's cold-blooded or something.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken off the hook.
It makes no sense to consume energy in bad conditions.
He got to the World Cup thanks to 455.
There are 445 out there.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
You have to be mild and wait for a better wind.
The goal is to exceed the 460 on Friday.
Why don’t you train abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer, I was in Italy and Germany.
I've got a lot of jumps and standardized technology.
I guess I should have done the same now.
Normally, you've been able to practice in the hall, now the hall is closed.
What would be the perfect race?
25 degrees warm.
There's a little wind, as long as it's standard.
An experienced ex-employee silenced politicians Over: "We have no room for division now and for many years"
Despite the favorable atmosphere of the economy, Juha Sipilä’s government must keep ice in its grip and warn against the alignment of the state budget with debt, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared budgets in the Ministry of Finance for decades.
According to him, there is no division.
Yle interviewed Virta, who retired in 2015, on Wednesday morning.
The construction of the state budget for next year is just beginning.
Recently, the proposals of the politicians have been put forward, among other things, to raise the guarantee, to reduce the car tax and to support electric bicycles, Virtanen considers as electoral speeches.
They mostly tell us that the elections are beginning to be close because when ten per cent of the state budget is financed with additional debt, we have no allocation now and for many years.
I think it's even cheating to talk about dividends when debt is taken, Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debts are owed to children.
Virtas has a long experience in the preparation of state budgets: he started in 1978 in the Ministry of Finance as the secretary of budgets and subsequently worked as the assistant head of the Department of Budgets and as the head of budgets.
Last before his retirement, he served as Chancellor of the Ministry of Labour and Commerce.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen noted that the current forecast of 3% economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a peak that will be starting to go downhill as early as next year, and Finland expects a 1% growth for decades.
Washington to change the rules of permanent residence permit
President Donald Trump has announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, the Green Card, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and restrict family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The bill is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who speak English and are able to live for themselves and who have the skills that benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Danish Queen's Wife Doesn't Want to Be Buried In The Same Place With Queen
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
In the picture Prince Henry and Queen Margaret pictured in April.
Queen Margaret, 77, and her husband Prince Henrik, 83, will not be buried next door, the Danish court said.
Traditionally, the royal couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has announced today that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the dissatisfaction of the prince with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, court spokesman Lene Belleby commented in the paper.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried next to the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated equally with her husband.
According to Hovin, the queen has long been aware of her husband’s hopes for the burial site and understands the decision.
Horrible moment on the road: the car was coming on the highway
Tom had a left-handed child and two young children.
They were not injured in the accident, but do not receive insurance money if the other party is not targeted.
The raid took place at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archive photo of the construction work of Kehä III.
Vantaa's Tommi tells us that his family survived a miracle on Tuesday in a car accident.
Tommi, Riina and two young children of the couple on the motorway near Keimolanport in the direction of Vantaala Hämeenlinna.
When Kehä III joined Hämeenlinnav<0xC3><0xA5>l<0xC3><0xA5>l<0xC3><0xA5>n<0xC3><0xA5>l, he was driving a white car that was driving the family car down the street, Tommi says.
Without the evasion, the car would have come on, according to Tom.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it went out of my hands, Tommi says.
The family's car crashed at a high speed into the defensive.
The parents and two children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is a little less than 3 years old, the other is less than a year old.
It was a good luck when nothing happened to us.
None of the passengers drove even towards us, even though there was a lot of traffic in the area.
The accident occurred at about 5:20 p.m.
According to Tom, no one stopped with them, and the family called the emergency center.
They got out of the car on their own.
The staff of the ambulance and the rescue facility arrived, and the condition of the family was checked.
The car went to the rescue department.
Tommi says he and the other side have a small income, and they got a family grant to buy the car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of the other car, the family, according to Tomm, will not get any money from the insurance.
That is why the family expects sightings from eyewitnesses of the car, which is why the family drove to the shelter.
We need a car every day.
It’s hard to take kids smart and go to work without it,” Tommi says.
Tommy saw the car was a white, old car.
It was probably in the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the start of the car registration number was SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I don't know how we're going financially, we'll have to calculate every cent today.
Tomi hopes that those who have seen the incident or know something about it will be contacted by the police.
The East New Zealand Police Agency and the Central New Zealand Rescue Agency confirm that they had an operation on the scene on Tuesday night.
The title and the story were corrected at 9:15 p.m.: Unlike the story originally told, the second car, according to Tomm, did not come to track the opponents, but was to drive from the accelerator to the village of the family car.
The show directed by Lotta Jäppisen deals with human relationships by means of humor - Self-Declaration will be seen at the What? theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings her first performance to the What? theater.
The self-revealer is a play about past human relationships and insufficiency.
Director Lotta Jäppisen said it would still be a good idea.
The subject is addressed in a way of humor.
Sad feelings don’t go away, he says.
According to Jäppisen, the round-theater project was carried out with a small budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the presentation is challenging to think about what a person reveals about himself when acquaintance with a new person.
Maybe he's pulling a role or is he approaching another jacket open?
The unspeakable presentation mixes fact and fiction
He has both directed and dramatized the show.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and does not contain any syllabus.
The director believes that while the show sparks the thoughts of young people, it speaks to all ages.
Jäppinen stresses that the Self-Declarer does not directly tell about his own or the working group’s human relationships.
Facts and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my world of value will be transmitted by the show.
I do not think that human relationships are bad, but I also do not think that human relationships, especially couples, are a condition for happiness.
Learning from Divorced Parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Explainer draws a current picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
He said many people have learned a lot from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don’t have to stay in a bad relationship.
The show will feature Minea L<0xC3><0xA5>ng, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes the spokeswoman Ella Snellman.
The music is also composed by Jäppisen and Roka.
Love in the theater ignited in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying as director of a theatrical statement at the Academy of Arts of the University of Turun.
There's two years behind, and the other one in front.
The enthusiasm for theatre began during the Kouvolan years.
Music classes have grown as an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and have performed, among other things, at the University Theatre in Helsinki and, lastly, at the Linnatheater in Turus.
Driving is becoming more and more interested.
The self-proclaimer got his first night last week in Helsinki on the Narrin stage.
A 45-minute performance in the future also saw at least in the study city of Jäppisen in Turus.
Self-declaration at Kouvola What? Theatre at 4.8.19 and 5.8.14 and 19.
Finnish Olympic winner recovered from a year-long karmic motocross accident - neck strap broken
Few athletes in Finland have the same unparalleled natural force as Janne Lahtela.
The pair’s ace travelled the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years and pursued his dream of an Olympic oval.
The dream came true in 2002, but the business of Lakhtela continued.
He was not only a tireless trainer, but also a tester of new species.
There are not many forms of exercise on earth that the chemistry animal would not have tried at least once.
It's excited to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela says.
Eventually, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela suffered a motocross accident.
As a result, his necklace and both hands were broken.
I wasn't at work.
I've had my wounds at home for a year, says Lahtela.
The ferry was bad luck.
He also admits that age may have contributed to poverty.
Driving at a fast pace can sound awkward.
But I didn't look for boundaries.
It's just as hard as a species, so you don't have to spend too much time with a 40-year-old like that!
After the accident, Lakhtela was in a special situation.
Her busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind him was a long-running freestyle coach for the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela began her laundry immediately after the end of her career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be here.
I didn’t really do anything, Lahti says.
During his training period, Lahtela often challenged his guards in slopes and physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired that my own thoughts didn’t make sense.
Not even about the species.
It was good to be in his place.
I really enjoyed it because I was only able to do it once.
The mandatory break inspired Lakhtela to become Finland’s main coach.
Without stopping, he fears that it would be over.
It’s easier to find places that have passed away than eggs!
Without the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as the coach of the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby for the riders.
I switched motocross to frisbee golf!
It just got off the shelf right away.
At its worst, I was seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lakhtela has always been a super-intensive coach, she does not require that her trainers be the same as her.
I don't force everyone in the same fashion.
In our species culture, there is room to be its own and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been consistent, says Lahtela.
Sex robots are coming and we need to be worried.
It’s here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robot industry – just as it had begun to feel that 2017 could no longer be a strange one.
Yes, I do.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
“We need to start taking sex robots seriously,” said Noel Sharkey, a founding member of the foundation and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the color of the robot’s eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
“Sex robots are being hacked, but they’re already being sold quite a lot, and we’re going to see more of them,” Sharkey said in a statement.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable doll robots with warm-feeling silicone skin and artificially created features that resemble human use.
Users can also customize the robot to their own preferences from eye color to nipples shape and to the type and color of fingernails.
What’s even more troubling is that robots have a “personality” that makes Stepford’s women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, a RealBotix robot can customize its features to the user’s preferences, even if it’s embarrassing.
True Companion’s Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah is insane, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality is as fully adapted to the user’s personality as possible,” the company’s website says.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, chatting, or “in the wind.”
The proliferation of sex robots has a number of worrying features, replacing real human relationships, but even more dangerous are women’s subjugation and direct rape fantasies, as the user approaches, for example, a shameful and repulsive programmed robot.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot to vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator. Why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalization and development reveals something darker and deeper in our culture: a decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is an option among others.
Of course, most men do not acquire a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
Marginal phenomena, however, tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many start acting strangely or offensively only after the market gives it permission.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to spread at the same time as women’s rights are threatened around the world and a president sits in the White House, who has cheered on women being harassed.
The Handmaid's Tale is not the most disturbing of its powerful imagery, such as images of dead bodies and excavated eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now there seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Sex robots are being tried to make as many real women (in the proportions of porn stars) as technically possible.
The developers of robots want their skin to feel real and their movements to imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their “personalities” are far from reality.
The robot can't leave a relationship or situation.
They do not have their own will or history—nothing that refers to independence or that violates the fantasy of complete submission.
They're nice servants.
Slavery.
Police suspect: two terrorist attacks were planned in Australia, the group was led by ISIS chief
The head of ISIS led a group of Australian men suspected of carrying a bomb on Etihad Airways' plane.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the leader of ISIS had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
It was suspected that the bomb was due to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the operation was suspended before a security checkup.
The police did not say why the company was suspended.
The second plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colorless gas emitting device and take it to a full public place, for example in public transport.
Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorists’ plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plots, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will also be continued.
The good side of Trump?
Make Mitt Romney look like a good-looking man.
During the Trump era, it has already been repeated until the end of the day that the voters’ strong voter turnout has also broken up families on a daily basis.
On Christmas and Thanksgiving, the advisory panels of American newspapers guided how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want our information library to rest.
Trump’s ability to unite families has been undermined.
I'm going to tell you about this because my cousin went to the village with me in New York this week, he's a leftist spiritual poet living in Chicago, who has long been a button opposite the Republicans of our family.
He pointed out that the common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins — including the Republican-friendly sister he’s been arguing with for decades — are suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
It is a good thing at the table, but in a broader sense, there are significant risks involved.
Trump has given the left a new leap, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to horrify his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even worse chance that Trump will normalize far-right Republicans, who suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember, in a whirlwind, Mitt Romney's silent version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% tax on income (and we've at least seen his tax return). Compared to Trump, they look like very mild violations.
When the Trump era is over, the next Republican presidential nominee needs to be clear, and it feels like a significant improvement right away.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our child to the Central Park carousel, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best thing you can get in New York for <0x24>3 without caffeine.
The horses of the carol are huge, the characters in the middle – the roaring clowns and the animals looking back in horror – are horrendous, and the music behind the scenes is strangely fascinating.
Over time, many of New York’s characters become disillusioned: the views from the tall buildings begin to get bored, the city’s silhouette becomes too familiar, and the reality of the city does not match its dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I have not fully come across the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a big traffic circle in northern London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-minded pub, but it is not counted.
The Central Park Carousel, on the other hand, is still a strange magical experience – even to the extent that two two-year-olds, one-year-olds and two-four-year-olds enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel full points if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, I was asked this week in the warehouse to rate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before placing my credit card on the reading machine.
The same thing in the cafeteria at my corner, but there I also get the opportunity to combine a 15 percent service fee with the estimate when I go to the coffee shop myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and pressures the customer server to put their personality into the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The merchant of the warehouse smiled in a sorry condition when I gave my credit card five stars to the experience.
Shefki Kuqi gets fired from Inter - "There was no trust of the management"
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuqi's follow-up from coaching assignments.
Fabrizio Piccare, who previously served as an assistant coach, is responsible for the training.
The other training team will continue with its current tasks.
The Italian Piccareta has previously served as an assistant coach in Sunderland, England.
In January, 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined the Inter training group, completed the UEFA Pro licence last year.
FC Inter, Chairman of the Board Stefan H<0xC3><0xA5>kans, regrets what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the confidence of the management of the track, so there was no other option now, H<0xC3><0xA5>kans commented in the track's statement.
The Piccareta Agreement will remain in force until the end of the period.
He will be in charge with the other training team in the home match against HIFK tomorrow.
According to the evening-Samomi reports, the team has melted throughout Thursdays.
Kuqi told players on Thursday morning that his assistant coaches, Piccaret and John Allen, have been removed.
Kuqi and Piccareta took a strong stint in the Inter match against PS Chemistry last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a photo of her 80s youth - would you identify a serious violin student?
Violinist Linda Lampenius posted a youth photo on Instagram.
A number of stunts have been added to the picture to determine that the music is in the picture of a 16-year-old student at the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself admires a serious young woman looking at the camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he was telling me.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of the past and also talked about painful topics.
A few years ago, he posted a picture of himself on Instagram.
In the second picture she is seen 20 years ago, in the second she poses now, as the mother of two children.
In his photographic text, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a human and refers to the eating disorders he suffered from when he was younger.
Just like 20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I’ve learned to love myself and how I look, Lampenius wrote.
Following the text he had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, uncertainty, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lambenius has spoken openly about his eating habits of previous years.
He was in the hospital at the age of 14 due to anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also became ill with his bulimia, which was eventually revealed only in 2006.
The healing began for a short time.
In addition to therapy and comparison, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, she received hospital treatment for the wrists on her wrists, which she received after she fell in a cell, according to the prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the prosecutors complained of the original murder sentence.
He killed Steenkamp’s Valentine’s Day in the early hours of 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door of his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have thought of his girlfriend as a night intruder hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again, as they consider Pistorius' six-year sentence too light.
The Attorney General will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal will likely be dealt with as early as this year.
If the complaint is accepted, the sentence of Pistorius can be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Campaign in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were detained in Greece, the country's foreign ministry said on bTV.
The police arrested a group of people camped in Sithonia on the morning of 1 August, with two Bulgarians among them.
They were released on the same day, but the case continues.
According to bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it had freed the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping areas and are already giving significant fines to all those who are camping in areas other than those reserved for the purpose.
The inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry said that the court may impose a fine.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may alleviate irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like your digestive system's nightmares.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritated bowel syndrome is an incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the UK. It causes stomach cramps, swelling, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People suffering from irritable bowel syndrome are usually encouraged to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen the digestive system.
According to Marco Colonna, the study’s director, immune cells guard against the mouth and make sure that harmful microbes are not hidden in the food.
Cells that cause inflammation balance cells that strengthen tolerability. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, the result may be an irritable bowel syndrome.
In experiments, it was found that immune cells that strengthen tolerance are present in mice with a particular bacteria in their intestines.
This bacterium needs tryptophan in order for immune cells to begin to appear. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
“We found a connection between the bacteria Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal intestinal microbiome,” says Professor Colonna.
“The more the mice had tryptophan in their diet, the more they had such immune cells.”
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerability and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
Researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, who studied immune-enhancing cells, found that although one group of mice had such cells, they were not present in mice of the same species, which were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the microbiome of the gut of mice, i.e. the normal gastrointestinal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When mice’s intestinal DNA was examined, six species of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice grown in a sterile environment that had no intestinal microbiome and did not develop immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
Researchers wanted to find out how the bacteria affect the immune system. They grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and transferred small amounts of fluid – without bacteria – to immature isolated immune cells from mice.
Immune cells have evolved into cells to strengthen tolerance.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice’s diet, the number of cells that reinforced tolerance increased by about 50%. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same cells that strengthen tolerance as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan from the bacteria Lactobacillus reuteri can cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic errors related to tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
“We certainly want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surfaces of the veins,” says Cervantes-Barragan.
“High levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their propagation.”
Jose Mourinho says Manchester United got a "neron" after signing a deal with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "neron" in his rows after signing a deal with Nemanja Matic. The midfielder made his debut in Manchester United's rows against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
With a <0xC2><0xA3>40 million transfer from Chelsea, Matic started with a 2–1 win in Dublin, United’s last game ahead of the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday, making an impression as a defensive midfielder Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
Matic, however, was not in the best condition yet, as he did not participate in the Asian T-shirts tour before the start of the season. He managed on the field for only 45 minutes – a change that must come before the start of the league season, according to Mourinho.
“He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking make him a nerd — he has the natural ability to think about football,” Mourinho says.
"We'll help her be ready rather than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began to race for the start of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the team has already done a "delightful job" by acquiring three of his four top players.
“Three out of four – thank you for that,” he added.
“I’ll be happier if I get all four, but they did a great job.”
Volleyball players have been battling Germany for two teams
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Cup to Germany in a direct draw of 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The level of German gambling is high.
Their game was equal in every sector, Finnish head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two rounds, Finland held its opponent tight, but in the third, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
“When we were played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to kick in,” Kangasniemi said.
The most effective in Finland was Piia Korhonen, who scored 14 points.
Finland, who lost three of the four matches, will face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Grand Jury already sends challenges to Trump Jr’s Russia meeting
A large jury in the United States has sent challenges to Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller’s convocation of a large jury has already sent challenges to the meeting of the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya from Donald Trump Jr. and the Kremlin.
The case is reported by Reuters, which at the same time confirms the Wall Street Journal's earlier announcement on Thursday of the gathering of a large jury.
A large jury has sent challenges to the meeting between Trump Jr. and Kremlin-led Veselnitskaya during the June 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to Reuters.
Donald Trump Sr.’s then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his current White House adviser, Jared Kushner, were also present.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has summoned a large jury in Washington means tightening the pace of the Russian investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a large jury to help investigate Russia’s involvement in the U.S. presidential election and whether Trump’s campaign or his neighbours were cooperating with Russia.
The grand jury expands Mueller's rights to collect evidence, send challenges and force people to testify voluntarily.
One of the great judges is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence that the prosecutor's investigation has uncovered and decides whether to bring charges in this case.
British inventor microchip himself to get home and into his car with a hand cushion
The British inventor is the first in the country to microsurgery himself so that he can open the outside door of his home, get into his office, and start his car with a hand shovel.
The microchip is between the 33-year-old Steven Northam’s thumb and front finger. Now he’s offering service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam’s BioTeq technology.
Northam collaborates with Geoff Watson, a sleep doctor at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, to ensure that the microchip installation meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchip for cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company also turns the locks of houses and cars into compatible with a microchip. The handling of one lock costs 300 pounds.
Northam is married, and has one child. She has installed a microchip technology both at home and in her BMW Z4, which starts when she puts her hand on the steering wheel.
Exhibition of the White House Costs Thousands of Dollars to Taxpayers
The White House’s recent decision to fly a naval helicopter to the southern grassland of the White House, an event featuring American production, cost taxpayers <0x24>24,000, according to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is named Marine One when the President is on board. It was a veto at an event held in the White House on 17 July 2017, which presented American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and a group of White House officials were introduced to the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter made in Connecticut, the samples included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
The military office of the White House had requested the helicopter to be placed on the ground just about 36 hours before it landed on the southern grassland for an "exceptional" event. This is evident from the documents of the Navy's HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
"I just wanted to make sure you're aware of this, because it's an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email the day before the event to his chief, a naval assistant flight commander.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn at 7:17 a.m. and the event would begin at 3 p.m. The helicopter would only leave after the lawn was emptied at 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
In addition, the message stated that if the helicopter’s departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be needed due to the limitations of service times.
The original crew was in a helicopter at the time of the incident, and the unit's security personnel were with the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by TIME magazine whether another crew was eventually needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 investigated whether the incident violated the law.
"One of our questions was whether this Hatch Act was violated. We were told that it was not violated," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the deputy commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But the official events also have political tones.
At the event, the president spoke in favour of a health care reform and a slower state regulation that was under consideration at the time in the Senate.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their travels.
But their use only for photographs is uncommon.
Trump's actions caught attention in February when Air Force One rolled the president's campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor's presidential plane on Twitter.
“The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which featured products made from American materials by American workers from all 50 states,” White House press secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
The HMX-1 crew conducts regular training flights in the Washington area and trains in the southern grassland to bring the president to the White House with an accuracy of centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 training landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights made in America were part of the crew’s monthly training allowance.
The unit also flew 11 hours on that day in “non-presidential support missions”.
According to the White House, the event did not incur any other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky’s spokesman said the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter presentation on the White House’s southern lawn.
HMX-1 does not have any records of flights in connection with the duties of the President, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the event.
According to the Department of Defense’s 2017 hourly compensation, the VH-3D helicopter’s compensation rate is <0x24>24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from Quantico's base to and from the White House in Virginia lasted a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are significantly lower.
“Calculating the costs incurred by taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading,” Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes personnel, maintenance and many other so-called insufficient costs to be taken into account in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 study by the RAND research company, compensation levels do not include staff costs, but they take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter in the event.
“The idea is to introduce American production,” Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and employing probably hundreds or thousands of people through it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopters and other defense equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It’s very important to point out that.”
It’s unclear if Trump was in a helicopter during the incident, but at least he was sitting in the fire truck driver’s seat.
In the White House, Trump was joking to the press about his own Sikorsky ship.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Salama hit the Vaasan road - trains must be replaced by buses
Passenger transport between the Wall Lake and Vaasa has been interrupted due to a technical failure, the Ratali Transport Centre said.
Trains will be replaced by buses.
An error in the traffic control system caused a bug.
The rail transport centre did not yet have an estimate of the duration of the repair.
Venezuela's Prosecutor demands the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country
Venezuela’s prosecutor has appealed a court ruling that would prevent the country from appointing a new representative.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that a representative elected in the vote on Sunday is due to be nominated on Friday.
In the controversial vote, the country was elected by a representative who could, among other things, change the country’s constitution.
Prosecutor-General Luisa Ortega said that the blocking decision has been requested on suspicion of voter turnout.
Ortega has also started an election poll on the ballot.
He appointed two judges after the British company that held the referendum said the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about a million more than the actual number of voters.
Only Maduro's allies were on condition of membership, and Maduro's son and wife are among the 545 elected members.
In addition to amending the constitution, the representative can dismantle the Congress led by the opposition and amend the laws.
Maduro is described as a dictator
Maduro’s actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers Maduro's constitutional amendment as a means of strengthening his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, in turn, have declared that they do not recognize the new representation.
Maduro claims that the new representative office is the solution to the country’s political and economic crisis.
The riots in Venezuela have been going on for months.
Many people have been injured and over a hundred have died.
Venezuela has fallen in the economic crisis due to a drop in oil prices.
Nowadays, many people do not have to afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to express its opinion on Friday, when a new representative office is scheduled to begin.
Finnish Russian man sentenced to four years in prison in the United States
A U.S. court in Minneapolis on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senahi to about four years in prison for involvement in global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a U.S. claim.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was returning home.
Finland surrendered Senah to the US judicial authorities in February 2016 despite Russian objections, according to the news agency AFP.
He was found guilty in March of computer fraud, which had earned millions of dollars in profits.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be expelled from the country after the execution of the prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry has slapped Finland after the detention and said that the man should not be handed over to the United States.
In a statement, Finland and the United States were denied that the detention was carried out in Finland without the knowledge of Russia in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus used to fish usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the data by further routing the Internet traffic, which enabled click scammers and spam spreads.
According to Kenneth Blanco, director of the Department of Justice’s Criminal Justice Department, the case shows that the United States is capable of prosecuting other cybercriminals.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco said in a statement.
Modified at 8:58 p.m.: Corrected literacy of the name of the convicted person.
Narcos' third-season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of shape, so Cali's cartel rises mostly on Netflix's hit series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is certainly not over.
The live streaming service has already confirmed that the series will be seen in the third and fourth production seasons. The trailer of the third season has been released, and it presents the new boots of the series.
In the third production season, the US drug police DEA turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world’s richest drug trafficking organization.
The organization, led by four ghosts, acts "like a Fortune 500 company", except that there is a little more corruption and violence by the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns to Javier Peñana, who recruits American and Colombian police officers to fight against drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Kari Kola performs exceptional light artwork in Paris
The light artist Kari Kola (Kuav) will perform an exceptional light artwork in honour of the first Day of Light set by the United Nations in Paris next May 16.
Kola is making a light artwork in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the UNESCO headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe monument in front of it.
In my work, I want to emphasize not only light but also darkness.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make my experiences more concretely visible, says light artist Kari Kola of his work.
I am well received from the invitation to participate in the first International Day of Light and bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola participated in the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when she will light up the UNESCO headquarters to celebrate the holiday.
I feel very privileged to have my art re-performed at UNESCO headquarters, says Kari Kola.
The work may be expanded significantly further.
We will announce this later in the coming autumn, Kola will continue.
The International Day of Light aims to highlight the importance of light to humanity and to raise people’s awareness of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light is celebrated at UNESCO’s headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men fight in a shopping mall park in Espoo
Two men were born in a dispute at the Ison Omena Park Hall in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute started when the other party accidentally drove in a prohibited driving direction.
There was a dispute between the drivers.
The driver who drove on the forbidden driving route would whisper to the driver of another car, as a result of which the car went on the move by colliding with the hitter's car.
After that, he hit the engine of the car that had collided.
The man admitted in the preliminary speech that he had caused damage and had done something wrong.
Timo Sonin's post titled: "After that came a waterfall"
On Thursday, Foreign Minister Timo Soini (vv.) published a blog post titled with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences.
In my time, the party grew from zero to the government party of thirty-seven people.
After that came the waterfall, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The text of the sound contains references to 17th-century France.
King Ludwig XV, or Madame de Pompadour, of this lover, is known to have used a waterfall comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, the historical books have left the phrases "our traces of water scarcity" or "after me of water scarcity".
UN: Afghanistan's democracy depends on women's political role
The elections will only be representative if all members of society, including women, can vote in them, the head of the UN delegation in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Interim head of the UN Embassy, Nicholas Haysom, said that there are hundreds of women in the provincial council elections, three women seek to become vice-presidents, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be stressed too much," Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan Provincial Council and Presidential Elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has posed threats to elections at the same time as international forces are moving into advisory roles.
This year’s elections will be the first time that power will be peacefully transferred from a democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women’s contribution will strengthen Afghanistan’s democracy.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

In the capital city area the weather is rainy and fairly windy.
In the afternoon cloudy, cloudy weather will prevail.
The evening is clearer and more concise.
In the southern and central parts of the country, heavy rains can also occur in the south.
In the evening in the south there is a luncheon and clearer, someone's rainy season may still come.
Afternoon temperatures are around fifteen in the rain, with more uniform rainfall on the south coast close to twenty degrees.
In the north, cloudy weather will change and local afternoon clouds will prevail.
During Friday and Saturday, low pressure controls the weather in the southern and central parts of the country, and precipitation is common.
In the north, the rains are low.
In the southern and central parts of the country on Saturday, there is rain in many places, including depression.
The rains also extend to Kainuuta.
In the northern part of the day, it will be mostly cloudy, but mostly dry.

A threat to the culture of the region by tourists
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The anger of the locals is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and fleee" tourism: we are only a few hours away from it, and we are wandering through a large number of sights.
Venice is crowded with tourists making quick day trips to the city.
The narrow streets are difficult to move and the fine squares are so crowded with visitors that the inhabitants of Venice will no longer be among them.
They are forced to move further and further away from the historic centre, as hotels have been replaced by houses.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about tourism issues in Venice.
The authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon of poor quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, time is given two or three hours.
You will follow the guided tour from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark’s Square, and turn back, describes Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini’s prevailing and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of the cities.
St. Mark's Trail is also one of the most popular sights in the historic center of Venice.
On the outskirts of Turin is the Church of St. Mark.
The anger of the locals is also mainly against cruise ships.
More than 50,000 people live in the historic center of Venice.
In 1951 there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians showed their minds against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroying the environment and driving people away.
Approximately 2,000 people leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be no more than tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says the demonstration organised by Carlo Belframe.
The equation is difficult, as the ships bring to Venice the income that it desperately needs and create the need for jobs in many different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it is planned that cruisers will go further than the historic center.
According to Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the administrative region of Veneto, where Venice is also located, had more power to decide on its own matters - if not full autonomy.
Every year, about 20 to 30 million tourists visit Venice.
You're driving to Kuopio?
Bad kilometre loads on the highway
On the highway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, the road to the north has been loaded with kilometres from work on Thursday afternoon to return transport.
The area is undergoing road surface work, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
The roads have a speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour instead of a normal 120 kilometres per hour.
Even in the 50-kilometre limit area, however, traffic had progressed on Thursday afternoon at a practical pace of walking.
The work progressed on Thursday afternoon on the side of Lake Siilinj<0xC3><0xA6>r in the Revelations-Pats, the Golden Cave.
I'll be fine without that kind of attention.
The 23-year-old runner had to notice the public's curses.
Amalie Iuel has published stunning pictures of herself in the Grand Canyon, among others.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in her current home country in Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400-metre race in March, bypassing the time of the race at 51.81.
A month later, he improved his 400-metre paternal run at the time of the Norwegian record of 55.38.
Iuel, who used social media almost immediately after his records, noticed that celebrity and publicity had their shadow sides.
Men from all over the world began sending photos of their genitals to Iuel apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iueli was forced to close his Snapchat account from outside.
I got a lot of "small pictures" from unknown people, so I had to change my account to private, Iuel told VG magazine.
Iuel did not want VG to identify exactly what kind of pictures he got in the interview.
You can guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'll be fine without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
Her mother is Danish, her father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel’s family moved to Norway when Amalien was 2 years old.
When the Amalekites were 12, the family moved to Namibia first because of their father’s work, then to Pakistan.
After that, it was Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
In Norway, we are much more open to discussion than in the United States.
In the United States, coaches don’t ask anything, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has a lot more time to deal with the athlete in person, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres in the patrol.
Legkakamma brought snowboarder Janne Korve to the forefront of her entire career - now included in the World Cup: "It's nice when you can't get anywhere"
It’s been a good time to count now that nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland’s most successful snowboarders, has been able to really enjoy his beloved species again this season.
Last summer, the continuation of my career was on the rise.
The injury to the leg had forced Korve on the surgical table in January, and the leg did not want to get any better.
His hand was also hit in the camping.
In the summer, I didn’t know what to do, whether the boarding was going on or not.
Sponsorships were interrupted and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that's how it's said that things tend to be arranged.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to pull back into the chest.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew it at least once when I was in the snow.
I was like, shit, yes, this is so fun again, let's pull it through a couple more.
The body was only able to count properly in September-October, but after a long fall, just painless training has been a big deal.
There are only a few that have been rounded.
It doesn't matter.
Competition has never been the most important aspect of sailing.
I've never run for one race.
I think it's frustrating to star at four years of singles, and then you're hot for that week.
I can't think of that, Corpi says.
Today Korpi competes in the semi-finals of the Spanish Sierra Nevada World Cup.
Although the individual races do not like him on the sailing side, he always goes on racing with the tough side.
According to Korve, the appreciation of the International Ski Federation has increased over the last few years, although some of the sailors have chosen the Norwegian X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is great.
However, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on the circumstances and the level of the competition.
Korpi is the oldest athlete of the 12-man team in Sierra Nevada.
17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to follow the younger friends' journeys.
I remember when I was at that stage, that everything was new and was so sick and excited about everything.
It also brings a new flow to itself, thinks the Corps.
I'm still in the trail somehow, but otherwise I'm not, that's the amount of flow in friends!
Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career against the backdrop of a boarding career.
The son of the director, Pekka Korve, is passionate about rugby: the sailor has his own rugby horses for which he makes training programs.
When I'm on a trip all the time, it's no longer possible to be at the Mass.
But I look at the nutrition results at least every day and usually something starting, Korpi says.
According to Korve, treatment management and training is a potential career plan when the boarding career is completed in time.
I don't think I'm planning to go that far, but at least that's a likely option.
I feel like I'm studying it with this snowboard.
I'm trying to stay nervous and evolve, maybe in the summer I'm driving something out of the way.
If it is my future profession, then it is not difficult to start it when it is already in the species.
Ravi events include an Elitloppet ravi tour organised by director Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The pair has rented a cruise ticket to the Elitloppet race in Stockholm at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone well, and people have been excited.
We are now at the point where at least there is no bankruptcy.
A few months is still time, hopefully the ship will be filled, Korpi says with enthusiasm.
Waiting for the nursing home project Kite has surprised everyone
Attendo Ester is the name of a new 41-seat nursery to be built for Kite.
The 1,700-square-foot building will be completed next summer on the other side of the neighbouring health centre.
On the contrary, a common question of wonder is what customers will be enough for the new treatment unit, because now during the war, many private care homes are able to miss customers.
Anne Flink Attendolta, Head of Care Services, commented that in the future, Kitee will have increased demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All sorts of services are needed, and when there are options, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Attendo bought private care homes from Kitee last year in Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The deal was about business, but the property is known to be a five-year lease.
Flink says there is no acute need to move functions out of these premises.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continuation of operations of the McVitie's factory in Scotland
The trade union seeks confirmation from McVitie's chief executives for a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish Department of the General Trade Union of the UK GMB, the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea cakes and other products manufacturing plant employs more than 500 people.
The Pladis company, which owns the McVitie's brand, has said that it has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in its plant in recent years.
The company added that employees and representatives of the trade union will be "probably the first" if there is a change in activity.
In a letter addressed to the head of the factory, GMB urges the company "to respond to concerns that no funding has been allocated for the modernization of production lines".
GMB trade union Drew Duffy is very concerned that the factory manager is not getting clear information about the business needs of Tollcross and future investment plans.
"The families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has focused heavily on the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow. The factory is a major employer in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and income, as well as Brexit, rising cost of living, and a continuous reduction in production, East Glasgow urgently needs successful McVitie’s production.”
According to Pladis, the factory manager had only received a trade union letter the previous day and the company will respond directly to the letter because it appreciates the continued interaction with employees and representatives of the trade union.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
We discussed with our employees, among other things, that, like other highly competitive and unsafe companies in the market, we continuously evaluate all of our business activities and locations in order to maintain our competitiveness."
In recent years, the company has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in its production lines and in improving its operations.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility and will certainly tell the first employees and trade union representatives if we intend to make changes to the factory's operations."
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may be interested in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's pursuit after paying <0xC2><0xA3>189 million for terminating the transfer agreement. But did PSG warn you of a record transfer to Barcelona three years ago?
Sensational transfer is the most spoken event of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record of transfer amounts. The previous record was less than half: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer amount of 89 million pounds.
After transfer, Neymar becomes the world’s most expensive footballer and also the world’s best-paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week’s salary after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be angry at PSG’s actions and the way Neymar has left the club with the most force. A source close to Barcelona says that Neymar has been very well cared for by the club since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of PSG warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that it was interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's top players.
“I’m not worried, because they know that if they’re out of touch with our players, we’ll become their opponents and we’ll get in touch with their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the teams.
But if they're attracting our players, they're going to have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems guilty of this: it expressed its interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar.
Neste Brake Stock Exchange Rise - Stock News - Ilta-Sanomat
The second major publisher of the day, Metsä Board, was at a higher level.
The broad European general index Stoxx 600 had risen by 0.1 per cent at the close of Helsinki.
The general index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange OMXH rose 0.1% to 9542.08 points.
The OMXH25 of the most exchanged companies is on the same level.

Trump's sparkling calls were invented - White House spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that the two phone calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump have never happened, according to the New York Times.
Trump’s talks with both the president of Mexico and the leader of the NGO have proven to be inventive.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had taken place.
However, he said Trump did not lie.
According to Sanders, many of the party leaders spoke to Trump personally, and Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieton had discussed at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty hard accusation.
Those conversations took place, they did not just take place on the phone, but face-to-face, Sanders said.
Speaking to the party provokes condolences
Trump said on Monday that the Mexican president had called him and that poor Trump had succeeded in cracking down on illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few will cross the southern border of Mexico because they know the journey to the U.S. border anyway.
The Mexican government released a statement on Wednesday saying that the call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump’s interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Trump made his speech at a major meeting of the NGO in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the party, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the NGO said it was unaware of any of its leaders' calls to Trump.
Michael Surbaugh’s earlier statement, in which he had apologized to the patriots, says he is speaking for himself.
Trump’s speech at the party’s meeting was a lot of admiration as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
He highlighted, among other things, the results of last autumn’s presidential election.
