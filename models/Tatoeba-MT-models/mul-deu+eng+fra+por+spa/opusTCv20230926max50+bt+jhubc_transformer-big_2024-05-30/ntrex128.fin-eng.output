Members of the Welsh House of Representatives Are Afraid to Look Stupid
Some Members of the House are confused by the proposal that MWP, the Member of the Welsh Parliament, should be replaced in their opinion.
The council began with plans to change the name of the representative office to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Bureau, regardless of the party, are concerned that the change could make them a mockery.
According to a representative of the Labour Party, the group is concerned that the name is "wrong with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means crap.
According to one representative of the Plaid party, the majority of the group is "dissatisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to the Conservative Party representative, his group views the name change as an "open mind", but notes that the word MWP is a short verbal logic to the word stupidity.
In the Welsh language, the w-letter is pronounced in this context in the same way as the Yorkshire English u-letter.
The Commission, which is currently working on the legislative amendment to the name change, said: "The final decision on titles representing the members of the representative office, of course, belongs to the members themselves."
The Welsh Administration Act of 2017 empowers the representative to change his name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion questionnaire on the proposals, according to which the appointment of a representative to the Welsh Parliament is widely supported.
The Commission recommended the members of the Wales Parliament or the abbreviated WMP, but the MWP option was most supported in a public opinion poll.
Members of the Bureau apparently propose alternative headings, but the lack of consensus may lead to a headline for President Elin Jones, who is expected to make amendments to the bill within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also includes other amendments to the functioning of the representative body, such as the rules on the loss of the representative body and the form of the committee system.
During the legislative proceedings, the members of the Bureau may give their last vote on the title to be called.
Macedonians go to poll in referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether the country's name will be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum aims to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of its northern neighbour is practically a territorial requirement for its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of a referendum such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's clocks are silent as the churches of Harlem live in difficult times
“The elderly people I’ve talked to say that before every corner of the street there was a bar or a church,” Adams says.
"There's no one today."
He said the loss of bars is understandable.
He said, “People’s behavior has changed.”
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood's common living rooms where people meet regularly."
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not go as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to extinction."
He added that churches can be replaced with dwellings and apartments that people inhabiting are not those that would support the remaining shrines in the neighbourhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments from these buildings will be white,” he says, “and so they will have a day when these churches will close their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will become my members.”
Both churches were built by the White churches before Harlem became a Black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original Methodist Church of the Whites moved out in the 1930s.
The nearby Black community acquired the building in its possession.
St. Martins took over the Blacks Society under Pastor John Howard Johnson, leading a boycott of Harlem's major merchants on 125th Street against their opposition to hiring or promoting Blacks.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by a fire, and when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, they introduced a tower tower.
Pastor David Johnson, father of Johnson's son and successor at St. Martins, proudly called the tower clock game "poor clocks".
The expert who played the tower clock game in July called it by another name: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first tower clock game played by black music, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
St. Martins has developed a complex company in recent months, which includes architects and contractors hired by the church’s landlords and, on the other hand, by the Episcopal Council.
Sakasti - a board of directors of the church - wrote to the council in July expressing its concern that the council would "try to spend the costs" on the council, even though the council had not participated in the commission's envoys of architects and contractors.
Some clergymen complained about the lack of transparency with regard to the steering committee.
Hai Injures 13-Year-Old Hummer Diver in California
Authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him when he scuffled hummers on the opening day of the hummer season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB TV that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and a group of others lamented for the boy to help with this water.
Hammel said that he thought first that the boy was only excited when he was caught catching a hummer, but then realized that he was screaming: "I was thrown away!"
Put me in the door!"
Upon reaching the boy, Hammel says that he has noticed that the whole swing had been broken open.
"I called everyone out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken to Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of the attacked shark is not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a media interview that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added serious injuries to the victim's upper abdomen.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casablanca’s Ponto Beach to Ecinitas’ Swami for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's to the UK's beauty industry
Sainsbury's challenged expert advisors at Boots, Superdrug and Debenham's cosmetics departments.
This is a significant turnover for the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty industry, which continues to grow even though the sales of fashion and home goods are declining. Larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be able to expand into other countries.
Beauty products are being invested as supermarkets seek to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's offers a duplicate of 3,000 products in its range of beauty products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific brands in their region, like Boots stores.
The supermarket will also re-launch its Boutique makeup range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan friendly as young shoppers demand it more and more.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will try out the stores at two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the transition of grocery shopping to small retail outlets will force supermarkets to come up with new customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said stores will look even more like warehouses as the supermarket chain fights cheap stores like Ald and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores and Habitat stores to its stores. The company says it has promoted food sales and made purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to reform its beauty and pharmacy department.
Sainsbury's tried the joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended with a dispute over how to share the profits of supermarket pharmacies.
The new strategy follows the company's acquisition, in which Sainsbury's sold 281 stores of its pharmacy business to Celesius, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of the plan to expand its four stores’ range of luxury skin care products with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the look and atmosphere of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are ready to advise customers.
Our brand range meets all our needs and appeals to our environment, as well as our convenient location make us a compelling beauty shop that challenges the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'fury' Holly Willoughby after retiring from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "infuriated" when TV host Holly Willoughby resigned from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home food and furnishings brand Truely.
The twin company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old director of This Morning announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby confused Dragons Den star Peter Jones by retiring from their lucrative life-style business at the last minute, and she now intends to focus on her new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "enraged" at a thrilling meeting last Tuesday held at Jones's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star had admitted that her new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of <0xC2><0xA3>1m was not awaiting her new <0xC2><0xA3>1 million worth of <0xC2><0xA3>15,000 worth of cash.
The company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand, and it was estimated to double Willoughby’s assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram leaving True, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, “Truly was clearly Holly’s most important project.
It was his long-term plan, which was to ensure his success for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everything in his power.
No one believed the events of Tuesday so close to the publication.
Marlow’s head office has a warehouse full of products expected to sell.”
This Morning is one of the UK’s most confident stars, and its origins, according to experts, can cause millions of losses to the company due to product investments, which include everything from pillows to candles and clothing to household food, not to mention the publication of a report.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby hosted Cappin Truly in 2016 and the 52-year-old Jones became president in March.
The couples go on holiday together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin’s TV production.
Willoughby will be released from M&S's new brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin's ITV show I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jonas said last night, "We did not comment on his business."
Strictly speaking and then we fell in love
He joked about criticism received in the media for his comments, which some would consider inappropriate for the president, and his positivity with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he did not make a “news anchor” sound.
"I didn't give up."
He said Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump sparked the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.
The nuclear talks, however, have been overwhelming.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in July, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a “similar reaction” from the United States to North Korea’s earlier move.
He noted that the United States, instead, is continuing its sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view.
“North Korea is doing great,” he said.
“We are going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship.”
According to him, efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results. The pilot experiments have been terminated, the hostages have been helped to liberate and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 more out of this crowd, we’d have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroys island, hundreds dead
First, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, a number of foreign volunteer organisations were told that they were not needed.
The state of emergency required by international assistance was not declared, although about 10 per cent of Lombok’s residents had remained homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so the situation is a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children forms a group traveling to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work on the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation to see if international organizations are allowed to participate in the assistance work.
Indonesia remains unfortunately unprepared to face the forces of nature, taking into account repeated earthquakes on a regular basis.
Although tsunami guards have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The fire was likely lost due to the missing tsunami warning syrene, although the warning was in effect.
Travelling between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship ordered to assist the victims of the earthquake in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia’s past infrastructure development the center of his campaign, and he has spent money on improving roads and railways.
However, Jokon’s administration has suffered financial shortages, while the new elections are approaching next year.
Jokon’s pressures are also heightened by tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted an older form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought in the streets with jungle scissors, arrows and other basic weapons, which have killed more than 1,000 people and forced tens of thousands to leave their homes.
Daniel Sturridge in Liverpool’s Late Level against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the championship on Saturday after scoring 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was inducted by Xherdan Shaqir at a distance of 27 from Chelsea when his team was in a losing position.
He moved the ball to the left before dreading the shot towards the rear pole.
Shooting blasted a high penalty area over the right upper wing.
Eventually the ball dropped over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell to the net.
"I was just trying to make myself playable so that players like Shaq and the ball are always playing as much up as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch, and I kicked off without thinking about things."
Chelsea led the game in the semi-finals 1-0 after Belgian Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In the situation, the Blues gave Mateo Kovacic a kick-off before riding near the midfielder and jumping into the Liverpool side.
Kovacic played a fast wall in the middle.
Then he freed Hazard to the penal area with a magnificent cross-section.
Hazard escaped the defense and crossed Liverpool's Alisson Becker's left leg with a shot at the squad.
Liverpool will meet in the Champions League block stage in Naples on Wednesday at 15:00 at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
Indonesia's Tsunami death toll rises to 832
The Indonesian disaster agency said early Sunday that the number of earthquake and tsunami deaths had risen to 832.
Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency, said in a press conference that many were left in the ruins of collapsed buildings when a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday and lifted waves up to six meters high.
The fragments of the ruined buildings spread widely to the city of Palu with 380,000 inhabitants.
Police detain 32-year-old man suspected of murder after finding dead a woman with a knife
The body of a woman found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning initiated a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews at 7:55 p.m. on John Street, where a 32-year-old man suspected of the murder was arrested.
Police are asking people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Criminal commissioner Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at its origins, but I would like all those who have been near John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on a board video, to contact the police, who may have vital information for the investigation."
A female police spokeswoman confirmed that the woman found dead was from Birkenhead and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, the crime scene has been attended by people who may have known the woman, who have asked about her whereabouts.
As the investigation continues, police say they are trying to inform the victim about what happened.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back into his apartment, but police had said no one would be let in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it can take hours before they are released back in.
A constable was heard telling the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
There was a lady in tears at the scene.
He repeated, “It’s terrible.”
In the isolated area at two o’clock in the afternoon there were two landscapes, and outside there was also a third.
In the isolated area, there were several police officers overseeing the basement.
Anyone who knows something is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 using ID 247 on September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell shovel was part of history's rewriting package
It would be a fairy tale to reject Patsah, given that his own fanatic Puritan hunters destroyed England’s cultural and religious monuments as well as the best of the Taliban.
Cromwell's companion, however, described Crick's proposal as "type inheritance" and "rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromell Hall, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of the statues would make a painting of Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command or execute the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Wrong Cromwell may have to suffer from the works of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent description of Cromwell expresses 19th-century opinions and is a historical evidence of the character, which many still consider to be worthy of praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more in the 19th century than today, view Cromwell as a defender of parliament against external pressure, which in this case of course was caused by the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate description of the subject is a subject of continuous historical debate.
It is certain, at least, that the controversy of the mid-18th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation; Cromwell, in turn, must recognize the character that represents the other side of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a state nurse deserve to be thanked and remembered.”
Killer kills Chinese farmer's life
Local media reports that a pig farmer attacked and killed him on a market in southern China.
Only the body of a man identified by his surname "Yuan" was found near a cigar on Liupanshui street in Guizhou province. The man's artery had been broken and he was on top of the blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig is preparing to vaccinate pigs in pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He and his cousin travelled from nearby Yunna province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the street.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also found the door of a nearby pig open.
In the fish, he said he saw a big cow whose mouth was in the blood.
According to the news, a criminal investigation confirmed a 250-kilo-kilo livestock fragment from the farmer's life.
Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named "Wu" said that "my cousin's legs were bloody and rubbed".
The surveillance camera shows a cousin arriving on the street feeding pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the track’s leaders told Evening News that the pig had been stabbed behind locks so that it would not hurt other evidence when the police collected at the scene.
The Yuan family and the authorities are reported to be negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs are known to have attacked people in the past, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-kilogram-pound pig stabbed a Welsh farmer against this tractor until his wife managed to haunt the animal.
After the incident, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that even though pigs are not usually aggressive, the blood taste can act as a “spark.”
“They’re just playful.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
We just have to respect them properly,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring heavy rains to the south of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to deteriorate as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring floodwaters to northern Mexico and the south of the United States.
Rosa's wind speed was 38 meters per second, a first-class hurricane, on Sunday mornings at the east coast, and it was located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific Ocean is forming a low pressure heading east towards the US west coast. When Rosa arrives on the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it starts blowing deep tropical moisture north towards the southeast of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa brings up to 250 millimetres of rain to some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching low pressure will form extensive rainfall areas to the south in the next few days.
Locally, 25-100 millimetres of rainfall causes dangerous heavy rainfall and potentially landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes 50-75 millimetres of rainfall per hour in certain landing areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
Some areas in the south, and especially Arizona, are expected to rain up to 50-100 millimeters.
Rainfall is possible and conditions can quickly deteriorate due to the fragmentation of tropical rainfall.
In the event of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid going to the desert.
The heavy rains can turn the canyons into flowing rivers, and flood storms cause local windstorms and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure area brings local heavy rainfall to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rainfall of more than 10 millimeters is possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region.
Disastrous tropical rainfall begins to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, until the rains expand on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, the United States can see strong swellings in temperatures cooling in the Arctic, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations at short distances.
In the central part of the United States we see an excellent example of great temperature differences on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowan Des Moines.
The heat in the summer will try to increase and expand again in the coming days.
The beginning of October is widely expected to be warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with temperatures reaching <0x2B>26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northern.
In New York, the temperature can be painful on Tuesday to <0x2B>26 degrees, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
According to our long-term forecasts, the eastern part of the United States has a good chance of reaching temperatures above average for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearings
More than 20 million people watched six television channels on Tuesday, where Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexual assault in the 1980s, gave their fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political situation continued as television broadcasters suspended their broadcasts at the last minute in a turn, according to which the FBI is conducting a week-long investigation on charges under a deal by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was overpowered by the witches of him and tried to take off his clothes in high school games.
Kavanaugh, in turn, expressed emotion at the witness's statement, saying he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
There were probably more viewers than Nielsen reported on Friday at 20.4 million.
The company dropped the average of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC., CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Other channels that broadcast the opportunity, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often finds it difficult to measure viewers who watch in offices.
Some of the proportions indicate that reading corresponds to the number of spectators in an American soccer drop game or an Oscar industry.
According to Nielsen, the highest number of viewers was on Fox News Channel, whose leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
After hearing it, the interest was still high.
On Friday, Flake was in the middle of the drama.
CNN and CBS cameras portrayed how protesters’ screams took him to the elevator on the way to a hearing on Friday with the Republican militia behind him announcing that he was voting for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed off as he stood in the minute store looking down at the airplane.
"I'm right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you believe he will tell the truth to the people?
“You have power when so many women are powerless,” she was told.
Mr Flake said his office had issued an opinion and added before the closure of the elevators that he would have more to say after the committee was consulted.
Hours later, cable and general broadcasting networks broadcast directly as the Committee on Justice began voting on the nomination of Kavanaugh for the Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he only worked on the understanding that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, as minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake was convinced to join his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, on the basis of his discussions.
Flake made his decision after discussing it with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of Brexit Politics
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused people of criticizing her EU plans of politically threatening Britain’s future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In addition to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls for a proposal that "Britain and the EU will inherit each other's ice-creams".
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrested Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect at LSU who played basketball for shooting 20-year-old Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, according to Baton Rouge Police Department, he is charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of the interview between Sims and Simpson, in which police told him that Sims had lost his eyeglasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they had found Simpson’s DNA, the WAFB said.
Police say Simpson admitted to Wayde's shooting in interrogation.
According to Advocate magazine, <0x24>350,000 was placed to guarantee him.
The East Baton Rouge municipality’s investigator released a preliminary report on Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The Agency thanked the Louisiana State Police Attack Team, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area for assisting the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Chief Operating Officer Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement authorities for their "newness and enforcement".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball at LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 records in the game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that he was "feared" and "scared" about Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this going on," Wayde said.
Volcano sprouts ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern habitats of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, Mexico’s Disaster Aid Centre urged citizens to stay away from volcanoes as the crater’s activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash eruptions were recorded during the day.
The center has been shivering and vibrating several times.
On social media, photos were posted covering a thin ash layer of car windscreens in residential areas such as the Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometres southwest of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan parasites unite before independence referendum anniversary
On Saturday, six people were detained in Barcelona in a rally of self-proclaimed protesters and police, and thousands participated in competing demonstrations and shared opinions on the first anniversary of the resignation.
Police arrested a group of masked supporters of independence, who threw the police with eggs and powder coats, which formed dark dust clouds on the streets normally filled with tourists.
Over the course of the day, more cracks erupted as the police used their bombs to stifle nudity.
The clashes between supporters of independence and unionist groups lasted for several hours, with the former shouting "no forgetting, no forgiveness", and the latter "live Spain".
According to the local press, 14 people have been treated for small shots in the demonstrations.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declares illegal, but which is celebrated by Catalan separatists, tension is still on the surface.
Voters voted for independence by a clear majority, although participation was low in the boycott vote against the difference.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as police tried to prevent voting in polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent a national police-backed demonstration.
However, the protest was organised, but it had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia's independence.
“Last year we came to one of the best moments of our lives.”
I saw my parents cry for joy when they could vote, but now we’re stuck in their seats,” he says.
Despite the precise but vital victory achieved in last December's regional elections, the pace of Catalonia's independence-promoting parties has declined this year, with many of the most well-known leaders in a voluntary detention camp or in a state of detention awaiting trial.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who portrayed the police supporting protest on her phone, says politicians on both sides of the fighter.
“The situation is getting worse all the time,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders incarcerated from last year, announced that he will take part in next year’s European parliamentary elections.
"To be a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the breakdown of democratic values and the oppression that we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car crashes into house
A 33-, 34- and 39-year-old man was arrested after his car was reported to have repeatedly collided with a house in Londonderry.
The events took place in Ballyngard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30pm British time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.

Livingston won Rangers 1-0 in Mengan
Dolly Mengan's first goal at Livingston secured victory
Serialist Livingston surprised Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox team.
Dolly Mengan’s goal was finally enough to win as Gary Holt’s team rose to second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew missed the first guest win of the season in the Premiership, followed by a series manager Hearts, who is eight points ahead of him next Sunday.
The Rangers will play at the Rapid Vienna European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his lossless pipeline in a series of six matches, with head coach Holt not losing a single time after replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Wasted Places Against Visitor Suffering from Lack of Blade
Holt's team should've been leading long before he scored, causing the Rangers a lot of trouble with their performances.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, and then Alan Lithgow slipped into Craig Halkett's punchboard, but passed the ball.
The hosts gave the ball control to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate on special occasions.
This is how the painting came about.
The Rangers created a free kick for Livingston, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played for Meng, from which he was able to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and finish.
The Rangers had held the ball by then, but found that the home team was defending, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely able to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Ranger's goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow guided the ball past another specialty in Livingston.
In addition to the two cases, the centres that rained in the Livingston Penalty Area were constantly cleared, and the penalty bag was demanded in vain - Halkett's stacked alternate, Glenn Middleton, and the ball hit by the hand.
"Great performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont with Tony Macaroni
Great performance and results from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent with each player, continuing through the ascents.
The team’s gameplay and crew has barely changed since it returned to the highest level of the series. However, Hold’s recognition of the way he’s strengthened the team once it’s reached.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at leading an excellently organized defense, while Mengan held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the match.
The Rangers didn’t have any ideas.
The team has occasionally performed really well under Gerrard, but is now far from his level of demand.
The last input was exhausted, and they managed to open the home team defense only once. This should act as a wake-up call for the Rangers, which is the middle of the series table.
Erdogan received a different reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky was blue on Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with NATO allies.
There have been differences between human rights and freedom of the press and Turkey's EU endeavours.
Erdogan continued his trip to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police prevented a 25,000-strong group of supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, justifying the matter with security concerns, but many supporters gathered nearby to see the president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also brought their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
Competitive protests reflect the dissent of opinions, and some of the Germans greet him as a hero when others harassed him as a self-government.
Accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
The cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at about 10am local time in the south of Deptford near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, with bustling traffic.
The driver stopped and the nursing staff came to the aid of the victim, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday’s crash site.
Police in the city say they are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
There are roadblocks on site and bus traffic has been directed elsewhere. Drivers have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in riots
Prison officials report that six men of the prison guard were injured in the high safety ratings in the prison riots.
The riots began at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 p.m. on Sunday and continue.
Special Tornado policemen have been brought to the site to calm the riots, behind which are eight prisoners in a prison cell.
Small facial injuries were handled by police at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: "HMP Long Lartin prison has been sent to specially trained prison personnel to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken to the police and they may have to spend longer behind bars.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Long Larti prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The head of the prison was reported to have received hospital treatment in June after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In addition, the prison was alerted in October for serious riots in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens heavy rainfall in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical low pressures rarely arrive in Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s happening early next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remains move across the South Desert with the risk of being plagued.
The Royal Weather Service has already issued a warning of heavy rains on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, which will arrive in the form of rain on Monday.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service of the Phoenix said: “Only ten tropical storms have preserved a tropical storm or low-pressure state 300 kilometres from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was still hurricane 65 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50-100 millimeters of rainfall. On the Mogollin slope in Arizona, it can rain up to 150 millimeters.
In other areas of the southern desert, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Basin, 25-50 milliliters are produced, with a total rainfall of up to 100 millimetres.
Rose rains can also be a blessing by testing drought in the area, if there is no risk of heavy rains.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains can also be useful, as they have suffered from severe droughts in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second-highest category, says weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa makes its first landing on the California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. It is still a strong hurricane with a wind speed of 135 kilometers per hour. It moves north at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm will lose its strength when faced with cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico during a strong tropical storm on Monday afternoons or evenings.
In parts of Mexico, rains can be severe and cause a significant flood risk.
"The southern California peninsula is expected to be 75-150 millimeters, and up to 250 millimeters is possible," says weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure on Tuesday mornings, from where she continues her journey through Arizona to southern Utah on Tuesday afternoon.
“The greatest risks for Rose or its remains are associated with severe rainfall in the California Peninsula, North Sonora and the southern desert of the United States,” says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rainfall and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Detained Assassinations
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found knifed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. British time.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is said to be in a "stable" state.
Police say they detained a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock district of Avon and Somerset overnight.
The police are requesting contact with anyone who may have video footage of the events recorded on their mobile phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh's Experienced Democratic Party's "Deception and Condolences"
“My vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s reckless and shameful methods,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh’s Democratic party suffered from “cleanness and anger” throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexual harassment that would have occurred decades ago in their teens.
Ford also testified in the hearing of the charges.
The president said on Saturday that “the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s excellence, character and courage” on that day.
“My vote for the confirmation of Kavanaugh’s nomination is a vote for one of the most earned lawyers of our time with excellent public service sea routes,” he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination, speaking of the importance of Republican voting activity in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from the most important elections of our lifetime.
“It’s not just a campaign, it’s a full campaign,” he said.
"That's why I'm going around every corner to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats took on the task of "resisting and preventing."
A senior aide to the Republican Party told CNN that the first important vote in Kavanaugh’s nomination process is expected to be sent to the Senate by Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll expected to rise
Officials said on Saturday at least 384 people were killed in a major earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, many wiped out along with giant waves hitting the beaches.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the city’s beach, when waves of up to six meters in height struck the beach in the evening darkness. Many of them rinsed their deaths as the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami caused a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When the threat of a tsunami emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach, and did not flee immediately, so they were the victims of it," said Indonesia's BNPB spokeswoman Purwo Nugroho in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but it drew cars, wooden bodies, houses and hit all over the country," Nugroho says. He adds that the tsunami reached an hourly speed of 800 kilometres in the open sea before its impact on the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial images published by the disaster agency show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftermath continued to cure the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said that energy released in a massive earthquake on Friday was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
It says that the territory of a city far from a long and narrow bay may have been able to flood the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as “wide” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He told about the ruins of the collapsed buildings found in the bodies of some of the victims, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the deaths and injuries could be greater than 300 kilometers north of Palu, in the Donggala area, which is closest to the center of the quake.
Communications are "completely broken, and no information has been received about Donggal," says Nugroho.
According to the statement of the Red Cross, there are more than 300,000 people living there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami hitting Palu, but authorities said it had received a warning during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of the building cries out loud warnings to people on the street about an imminent tsunami.
Just minutes later, the beach is hit by a water wall, which takes away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a wide-ranging power outage, which cut off communications from around Please, which made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities say the army has started sending aid from Jakarta and other cities by transport, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has been reopened for assistance only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was due to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami killed more than 800 people.
It's really bad.
The staff of World Vision Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Pluto, where they have been housed in the tent canvas cascades in the office courtyard. On their way they passed the scene of destruction, Doseba says.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he says.
It's really bad.
When aid groups began their unsettling task, some complained that foreign aid workers were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to flow once the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Indonesia's Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani.
“When the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start receiving international assistance, but the declaration has not yet been made.”
When the second night came down on Pluto after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family members who were missing were awakened to the hope that by the miracle of their loved one’s trade they would differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was raised from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in the ruins for two days near her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia's coach, had trained two missing addicts for the Asian races that ended earlier this month.
The Roa Roa hotel was also hurt by its students, Mandagi says.
“As a parent of the Independent League, I have my own emotional responsibility,” he says.
Gendon says he has desperately tried to reach out to the contestants at the beach festival via WhatsApp messages after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the affiliate community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one grey sign appeared instead of two blue ones.
"It means, in my view, that messages were not delivered," he says.
Thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from Brink's security account staff on Friday morning when it was supplementing the Newport on the Levee ATM, according to a Newport police station statement.
The driver of the car had been emptying and replenishing an ATM in the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
When Brink's employee's attention was elsewhere, "her husband runs behind her," who stole the purse for delivery.
Eyewitnesses reportedly saw several people fleeing the scene, but police did not specify their number.
Persons with information about their identification are requested to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West to change his name to Ye
Kanye West is renamed Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted: "A character who was formerly known as Kanye West."
Ye has been a 41-year-old West nickname for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album released in June.
The change is ahead of her upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande in the program, who, according to the creator of the program, canceled her participation for "emotional reasons".
West has previously said that the word also has a religious significance for him, in addition to being an abbreviation of his professional name.
While discussing the album's name earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, "he believes that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "you".
"So it's you, us, and all of us.
It began with Kanye, which means unique, and ended up in a shorter form of Ye—which only expresses goodness, evil, confusion, everything in us.
The album is mostly a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced his favorite names Love and Brother Love this year.
West’s former partner, JAY-Z, has also occasionally removed and restored the alphabetical and large letters.
Mexico’s AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians. The announcement came as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared on Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, promised that he would "never use an army to oppress the Mexican people".
The armed forces came out of a peaceful protest on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people during a time when left-wing student movements were rooting in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships and opening up more free public universities.
He said young criminal gangs were driven by a lack of unemployment and education opportunities.
Joint ventures should double the funding for AI research.
The U.S. should double the funding it uses to research AI when China is stepping up its industry, says Kai-Fu Lee, an AI researcher, who has worked with Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The opinion was preceded by communications on AI in various parts of the U.S. administration, although the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: it aims to be a leading AI developer by 2030.
“A doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind and that we are looking for the next breakthrough of AI,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence achievement would be made in the United States, Lee said in a CNBC interview this week.
Lee's book "The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Cluster. He works as the CEO of Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's most significant<0x2B>artificial companies.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mello University that beat Othello's top-ranked player in the United States, later serving as Microsoft Research's chief executive and head of Google's operations in China.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. administration's previous technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and the Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next event would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. researchers have worked hard to get public grants.
"Academic influencers are not taken by China, but by big companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities to work on AI.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States step up its artificial intelligence efforts.
"In my opinion, those who hold an AI doctorate should automatically be awarded green cards," he said.
China’s Council of State plans for the next generation of AI in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other state organizations grant money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together industrial and academic partners, and the White House has announced the creation of a special committee on AI.
DARPA also announced this month a <0x24>2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
NSF, in turn, invests more than <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative to establish the National Security Commission on AI has not progressed in months.
Macedonians in the referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked the country's aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns the province of Macedonia, considers the name of its northern neighbour to be practically a territorial requirement from its territory, and has therefore opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The governments of the countries signed an agreement on a new nomination in June, but nationalist opponents believe the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether voting activity reaches the required 50% threshold for the result to be legal.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership endorsing the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, which has risen since the collapse of Yugoslavia, can seek to become a member of both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive effect.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, no irregularities were reported by 13:00.
However, voting activity was only 16, compared to 34 percent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, where 66% of the voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children and we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in a referendum on the name change of Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the booing-up tents in front of the Skopje parliament.
“We’re talking about NATO and the EU, but we want to join heads up and not through the kitchen door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to the other side, like China and Russia, as part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the needed investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe in the majority voting for the name change, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said "yes" sounds like "our fashionable future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Political Research Institute on Monday pointed to 30-43 percent voting activity in the referendum - which is below the required activity.
In a second poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they voted in favour of the alternative.
In order for a referendum to succeed, the voting rate must be more than 50% with one vote.
Failure of a referendum would be the first serious backlash to the western government when it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero defeats all of Brighton's defenses
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear mark on Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made the 65-minute shot he made look ridiculous easy.
At the beginning of the picture, the Argentine top player got a feed from the middle field.
He found an empty space on the field by wrapping through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero noticed that he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed by one of the defendants and then left several others on the edge of the Brighton Penalty Area.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch inside the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed Brighton guard Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot at the right-hand corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero has problems with his legs."
"We said he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, he painted at the time.”
However, Sterling had already given the skies an advantage in the championship match.
The painting came with 29 plays.
Aguero got the ball in the Brighton area.
He gave Leroy San a beautiful pass on the left side.
Sane took a few contacts before sending the ball to the rear pole toward Sterling.
The attacker of the Sky Blues threw the ball into the net just before the end line.
City will face Hoffenheim at 12:55 Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a champion in the game against Rockies
The Nationals are out of the drop-off game, so why try harder to get started?
However, Scherzer always hopes to take the lead in a Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a downhill streak. They have one win difference to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western series.
The Rockies caught at least a wild card with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still aiming for their first division win.
"While we don't have any bets, we can at least step up to the feeder, knowing that the atmosphere of the audience and the second team here in Denver creates the most demanding competition I've ever faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to take on the challenge?”
Nationals have not yet released their start-up on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer a chance under these circumstances.
Scherzer kicked the training season on Thursday, playing 34 at the start of his game and feeding on Sunday with his normal rest period.
Washington's right-handed player has a 18-7 win-loss ratio during this period. The ERA score is 2.53 and he has burned the opponent's back 300 times, with the turntable being 220 2/3.
Trump campaigns in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who spoke of the importance of Republican voting activity in the midterm elections.
“All of our achievements are in play in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important elections of our lifetime.
This is one of the really great -- not just a campaign, but a full campaign, and that's why I'm going around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They have decided to return to power by whatever means, and you can see their wickedness and their wickedness.
They don’t choose who they hurt or who they have to shake to gain power; that’s what they want, power and power, but we don’t give it to them.”
He said he took on the task of "resisting and preventing" the Democrats.
"And it has been visible over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "hateful and evil and vicious and lying."
Referring to Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Senate’s longest-influential Senator in the Senate, the audience responded with loud whistles.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you read the document?
Uh, uh, what?
Well, uh, no, I'm expecting a little -- it was really bad from the body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinions.
I wasn’t really surprised when my local Momentum activists voted against me for a statement of distrust.
At least I'm just the last representative of the Labour party to be told that I'm not welcome - just because we say our opinions.
My colleague, Ms Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the statement of distrust was critical of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The East Labour meeting in Nottingham said on Friday that “we want our meetings to be participatory and productive.”
For most of the eight years that I have served as a local Labour representative, the Friday sizes of the Party Council have been exactly that.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone, and a "more friendly and gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever even started.
It is even clearer that the Labour Party is no longer tolerated by divergent opinions and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is compatible with the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues with whom I thought I would share a similar political view began to expect a full-fledged translation and a position that I would never otherwise have agreed to, whether it be national security or the EU's internal market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it really doesn't matter what I say - the result is a series of insults on social media, demanding that my choice be cancelled, rejecting central politics, and I hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my own experience.
I really know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because at least the comments that I have made are political in nature.
I highly respect the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face daily sexist and racist insults, and it is never bad.
Normalization of maltreatment is one of the most disturbing features in politics of this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for the Labour Party to adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with every statement of distrust or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
For two years, I have been encouraged to keep a low profile and to refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "everything goes well".
But that’s not why I went to politics.
Since joining the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, as a result of the Thatcher government's failures to co-educate, I have sought to promote better public services for those who need them most, both as mayor and as minister.
I have never covered my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could have been surprised by my point of view or my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state progresses towards a Brexit that is detrimental to households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy in questioning my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to the Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I represent you with respect, and the threat of separation or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Invincible in Ayr block race
Two last-minute goals were slightly distorted in the final result, but Ayr undoubtedly deserved a win in the fun of the day’s Tennent <0xCC><0x81>s Premiership.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of ten that hasn’t lost a single match.
Great defense and more successful taking risks was ultimately what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can be happy for a reason.
"We've been challenged in our games and we're still invincible, so I can be happy," he said.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, "All the glory to Ayr, they took risks better than we did."
Ayr took the lead for 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's painting and Frazier Climon's successful conversion pot, but the yellow card of Scottish captain Roy Hughes, given to the Warriors, allowed Melrose's rise, and Jason Baggot made the painting.
Climo raised Ayr's leadership in the penalties, and just before halftime he painted and succeeded in the conversion pot by raising Ayr's leadership in the 17-5 readings.
But Melrose started the second set well with Patrick Anderson's painting, which in the conversion pot Baggot managed to reduce the difference to five points.
There was a long delay in the game when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and was taken out of the field. As the game continued, Ayr raised his lead with Stafford McDowall, which Climo succeeded in the conversion path.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, after which Melrose Bruce Colvin made a hard-pressed, unsuccessful conversion pot.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling a balloonless Climo, and Macpherson scored a goal from Ayr's back.
Climo succeeded in the conversion path in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and beat Gregor Henry to finish home team fifth.
Still Game series star to start in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran has been named the director of a licensed restaurant company and will start working in the restaurant industry as well.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show he writes with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kieran is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the public registry data, he has been listed as the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but a source in the Scottish Sun magazine suggested that Kieran wanted to join Glasgow's flourishing restaurant business.
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia's inland state tries to get back in contact with the Pacific
Marines patrolled outside the navy base in La Paz.
The flag of public buildings is a blue flag of the sea.
The bases of the fleet from Titicacal to the Amazon have been damaged with a slogan: "Justice the sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to get it back.”
In Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th-century resource war is still strong – as is the need to sail the Pacific once again.
The hope is at its highest for decades, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of reflection.
“Bolivia has strong progress, community spirit, and resilience, and of course a positive attitude in awaiting a final solution,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Several Bolivians around the country follow the International Court of Justice’s ruling on large screens in hopes that, at the end of a decades-long debate in The Hague, Bolivia’s position on Chile’s obligation to grant independence to Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic president Evo Morales, who is facing a disputed re-election next year, is playing a lot in the lineup next Monday.
"Back to the Pacific is very close," he convinced at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court is unlikely to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it decides, the situation would hardly change.
The Dutch-owned UN body has no authority to transfer Chile's administrative areas, and the ICJ has announced that it will not determine the end of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision is given only six months after the last statements have been made suggests that the case is “not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed rather than promoted Bolivia’s intentions.
“The current Bolivian government has seized the issue of maritime connectivity,” said Zárate.
Morales’ controversial rhetoric has suppressed the rest of the Chilean charity, he said.
Bolivia and Chile are still continuing the discussions at some point, but it is very difficult to hold the negotiations thereafter.
There has been no second embassy in either country since 1962.
The former President and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, disagrees with the view that the court's decision would have been exceptionally swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end the 139-year-old dispute for the mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzad also denied that Morales, one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, had used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of contact to the Pacific," he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can rely on the United States.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless it can rely on Washington, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the heads of state at the Singapore summit.
The statement came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is restarting nuclear-weapon diplomacy, just three months after the U.S. met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was "a distant dream" to believe that the continued sanctions and the U.S.'s opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean war would hit North Korea's knees.
Before Pyongyang has first taken significant measures to promote disarmament, Washington is cautious in adopting the declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang intends to give up the arsenal, which the state is likely to see as the only real means of ensuring its own security, has become widely suspected.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
The fashion shows in Paris showcase the latest collection of large-size headlamps, which will soon be on your doorstep
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don’t need to continue searching.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled in their SS19 collection a range of special cross-style headbands that evaporated the style circles of the Paris fashion show.
Extremely impractical headlines dominated Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations to fashion shows as well.
Valentino’s most eye-catching creation was a beige hat with a wide steamer, which covered the models’ heads almost entirely.
Other oversized accessories included corrugated watermelon, witch hat and even pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a range of distinctive masks – just before Halloween.
Many colorful masks had lipsticks, and they resembled more Hannibal Lecter than a senior.
One snorkeled and masked creature was more like a diving instrument, and the other was like a melting ice cream dish.
And if you want to take a stand for a large-scale fashion, you were lucky.
Fans of fashion predict that huge scarves will appear on the street.
The oversized hats closely follow "La Bomba", a half-metre-lily shoulder strap that has been seen in all of Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult costume of the impractical hat, which was abundant on social media, also glittered into the fashion shows of the second cake creation – a beach bag made of oil that is almost as large as the wearable model.
Burned orange ribboned raffle bag with white leather straps was the most eye-catching creation of the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris during the fashion week.
Renowned stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I’m assuming I’ll see large hats and beach bags on the street next summer – designers have made such a big impression that it would be difficult to overlook the demand for large fittings.”
John Edward: Language Skills is a Key Skill for a World Citizen
Schottland’s private schools’ learning results have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. The success has been reinforced by individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
Over 30,000 schools, represented by the Board of Private Schools of Scotland (SCIS), are located across Scotland to provide a high level of service to their pupils and to the parents of their pupils.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen careers, higher education and higher education, as well as global citizenship.
As an actor in the education sector, who can design and implement customized learning content, we have noticed the status of languages as a preferred and desired subject of continuous learning in educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes to his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships of trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s latest test results, we find that languages are at the top of the lists in terms of the percentage of access among private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest score of A.
The material was collected from 74 SCIS schools. Based on the material, 72 per cent of the students who received the best grade A studied Mandarin, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language learning as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently subjects of choice, but they are held at the same value as natural sciences (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school curriculum and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment Agency found that 17 per cent of situations where the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary for the advancement of the future career of young people.
The more potential jobs require linguistic skills, the more essential these skills are formed in the global world.
If a person has studied a second language, he/she will have a priority in the future on this lifelong skill, no matter what career he/she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner to automatically put a linguistic person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them are unable to talk in a foreign language, and French was the only language that could speak a two-digit figure of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
In particular, knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better opportunity to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach each other.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are expected to be important to the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, there are always a number of language options in the private schools taught by specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future brings when it comes.
At this time, it cannot be denied that languages in the international business environment are still very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Today’s languages should indeed be seen as ‘international communication skills’.
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and a high level of youth in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of SCIS of the Board of Private Schools of Scotland
LeBron makes his debut in San Diego on Sunday
The expectations of fans awaiting LeBron James’s first appearance in the Los Angeles Lakers rows are over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday before the start of the season.
But how many minutes he really plays will be seen.
"It's going to be more than one, and less than 48," Walton Lakers said on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to be playing the sluggish minutes.
Exercise tracker James was asked earlier this week about his plans for the six games ahead of the Lakers.
“At this stage, I don’t need any pre-match games anymore to prepare for,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five election events scheduled for next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While awaiting a vote for his election to fill the vacancy of a Supreme Court judge, Trump seeks to increase support for upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in the November election.
What time is the Trump campaign in West Virginia today and how do you see it online?
Trump’s West Virginia Wheeling event starts at 7 p.m. on the East Coast on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s campaign event in West Virginia online as a live stream via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump will take a stand for this week’s hearing of Supreme Court Justice Nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became prone to intense sexual harassment allegations that have delayed the Senate’s verification vote until a week later on the allegations put forward in the FBI’s investigation.
But the primary goal of the campaign series is to support the success of Republican candidates in the narrow November elections.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign was commented on the purpose of the next five weeks' event "to prepare volunteer and pro-republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
"Government of Congress is so essential to his intentions that the president is ready to travel to as many states as possible during the pressing campaign period," Trump's anonymous representative told Reuters.
Today’s venue is Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, and even supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh can arrive there, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit in the current month to West Virginia, a state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump supports Republican West Virginia Senator Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind in polls.
“There’s no good sign for Morrisey that the president is trying to increase his support in polls,” state scientist Simon Haeder of the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Fighting Will to Keep Hope Up Before Sunday's Singles
After three unilateral sessions on Saturday afternoon, the four games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-enhancing power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe it, and even more in tournaments like this.
Where is this power of success with them right now?
“They had a six-point lead that fell to four, so we’re taking this as the hip of success,” said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has a priority: four points ahead and 12 playable.
The Americans, as Spieth said, experience that they have a little wind on the sails and a lot of encouragement, like the fitness of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which allowed them to play all day together and get three points out of four.
Spieth has been overpowered from timber to greenery, and leads by example.
The win-win’s velvet throat sounds strengthened as he progressed in his lap, as he managed in a critical pit to level the match level to four when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
The pit where they won the 15th match was followed by a similar cry that gave the impression that he believes the U.S. team has not yet lost.
"You have to focus really well and just take care of your own party," Spieth said.
That’s the only thing these players have left.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players who have scored more than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special, but delicate duo has won four out of four without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that did not make any bogies on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogis on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and receive energy from this generous audience, confirms that they are Sunday’s favorites. And when the sun sets at Le Golf National, another most popular player to ensure a possible win in Europe could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time with different holes.
However, talks about Europe's success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Alex Noren's paired Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the morning four-game.
In the first nine holes, one bog and two double bogs digged the Spanish and the Swedish so deeply that they were not able to survive there.
But on Sunday, no one's going to help you get out of the box.
Four-ball and four-game are fascinating to follow closely from the point of view of cooperation between pairs: what kind of advice they give or give away and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has assumed a significant leadership position before the last day, but this quarter-final game showed that the United States team has a willingness to fight, even if it is suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe takes 10-6 lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of the Ryder Cup after they took the lead in the 10-6 United States on Saturday in four balls and four games.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the winning streak with two wins from the scammer Tiger Woods, and scored high to four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who worked hard to maintain his loss at Hazeltin two years ago, ruled the poorly played U.S. team in the morning's four-ball match, taking it 3-1.
The U.S. was the toughest opponent in the four games, winning two games, but they were unable to eliminate the lead.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points out of 12 matches on Sunday to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called together "Molliwood", were the second couple in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the first four games.
After finishing in the first four-ball matches with Woods and Patrick Reed, they then finished over-the-counter with Woods and the American starter Bryson Dechambeau in an even more effort of 5-4.
Woods, who barely survived through two matches on Saturday, was occasionally very brilliant, but has still lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and four games, and even seven consecutively.
Justin Rose rested four balls in the morning, but returned to the quarter-finals with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked first and third.
Europe did not get everything the way it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to the south.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the United States by two points on Saturday.
They scored a 2-1 win against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarter-finals, and later a 4-3 win against Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the quarter-finals after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has climbed from the four-point backstop to the levels at the start of the doubles, although on the Furyk side the level is also enough to keep the win.
However, after two days for the second one, it may be best that Sunday’s counterattack is too demanding.
North Korea 'nothing at all' to disarm itself without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the continued sanctions only increased distrust of the United States, and in these circumstances there is no possibility that North Korea would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significantly charitable measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and promising that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or weapons.
“But we haven’t seen a similar move from the United States,” he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of maintaining national security, so in such circumstances, it is not possible to unilaterally disarm ourselves," he said.
Although Mr Ri reiterated the popular complaint that Washington did not accept a gradual nuclear arms surrender, which would reward North Korea for every interim issue, his statement is significant in the sense that unilateral disarmament was not completely excluded, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Mr Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first U.S. President-North Korean leader's summit in Singapore on 12.6. In a statement, Mr Kim convinced "the Korean Peninsula to dismantle nuclear weapons" and Mr Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the easing of strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States has called for 'nuclear disarmament first', and has increased pressure by sanctions to achieve its targets by means of refugee – even against 'peaceful' declarations," Ri said.
"The idea that the sanctions would get us on our knees is a wish of the indifferent.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions only deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months, adding: "If the party demanding the disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to such an impasse."
Yet Rin’s sound was significantly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting missiles toward the U.S. mainlands was inevitable after Trump’s “bad president” called Kim “a suicide-righted man.”
Even last year, Trump threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, but this year Trump yearly praised Kim for this courage to approach arms renouncing, yet stressed that there is still much work to be done and the sanctions must remain until North Korea creates North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn’t have a temporary backbone: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia suggested that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress that has already been made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the strengthening of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue strong and unsuccessful until we prove a complete, final and confirmed nuclear weapon.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea with the aim of stopping the production of Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missiles.
Pompeo met with the North Korean Rin at the UN General Assembly and announced he would return to Pyongyang next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go smoothly.
After leaving Pyongyang, he described the progress, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster demands" just a few hours later.
North Korea pledged to close its missile base and nuclear power plant in a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States takes "similar measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "similar measures" to the security measures Trump pledged to meet with Singapore, and a move towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Have Completed Adequate Rest Instructional Course
All undergraduate students at Harvard University will participate this year in a course aimed at increasing the rest of students. The course is an antidote to the university’s flourishing macho culture, where students spend a long night with caffeine.
According to the researcher, the world’s best university students are often quite unaware of the fundamental issues related to their own well-being.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard University, who works on sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes the course will be the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course when he learned about the influence of sleep.
“After the lecture, a young woman spoke to me and said, ‘Why do I only hear about it now, in my last year of study?’
“No one had ever told him about the need for sleep, which I thought was surprising,” he said in an interview with Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how the right dream habits support academic and sporting performances as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of medicine at Harvard University and deputy director of health services at the University, said the university had completed the course after they had heard how students suffered from severe sleep deficiencies during the study week.
The one-hour course includes a set of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented with a picture of the living room, where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, and thus get information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effect of sleep deprivation on sports performance and regular evening activities.
The second section tells the participants how long-term sleep deprivation can raise the risks of a heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
With interactive icons, the campus map encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
“We know that this does not have an immediate impact on the behavior of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these matters in the same way they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking,” Professor Czeisler added.
Throughout the night, student loans are still a matter of pride, according to Professor Czeisler, and the current technology and the ever-increasing pressures of students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
“Getting adequate and high-quality sleep should be a student’s ‘hidden weapon’ against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even against weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a brain-like state of starvation, which is why a person is constantly hungry for a professor.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler plan the course after he took part in one of the courses he taught for his first year at Harvard last year.
She tells us that the course opened her eyes and gave an impetus to organize a comprehensive course for all students on campus.
He hopes that all graduates will be able to complete a similar set of studies before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up a wake-up clock to remind them of sleep time in addition to waking up in the morning, and urges them to keep in mind the adverse effects of electronic display devices and LED lighting caused by "blue light".
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengan shot lost to Gerrard's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers again experienced a new losing day when Dolly Mengan's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1–0 win.
The Ibrox players were applying for their first win since the 4–1 game against St. Johnstone in February, but this time Gary Holt's team won, and Gerrard only lost to another 18-game managers during his career. The Rangers were eight points behind the Heather.
Menga scored the ball seven minutes before the half-time, and with Rangers’ fallen battleship thereafter, the situation was no longer leveled.
As a result of the game, the Rangers fell to sixth place, but Livingston climbed to third place, with only Hibernian at the top of the draw.
Rangers may have other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game by hitting the head of an object exploded by a visitor, and the wound has to be treated.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team's setup, which had beaten Ayr and advanced to the Scottish Cup semifinals.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 setup, with which the team scored Hearts last week. The same strategy resulted again when the well-built setup managed to penalize the opponent almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using the situation for his own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to score in just two minutes, when Mengan's first input gave Scott Pittman a free run for Allan McGregor, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then led his free-standing to Craig Halkett, but another defender, Alan Lithgow, only managed to widen the rear pole.
The Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but the last third of the game was no longer in the air.
Alfredo Morelos demanded a penalty when at fifteen minutes he and Steven Lawless had collided, but judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian’s requests.
The Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly resisted the difficulty of Lassana Coulibaly's punch and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston’s 34-minute goal was an unexpected opening, but the situation wasn’t just due to the team’s hard work.
The Rangers still couldn't do anything for Jacobs' long input tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who coldly put the ball to Meng for easy scoring.
With the changeover Gerrard decided to replace Coulibal and put Ryan Kent on the field. The change almost immediately affected the game, as Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, the attack interrupted Kelly's impressive quick defense.
Livingston asked the visitors to play their own game again, as Lithgow and Halkett continued long inputs in succession.
Holt's team had the opportunity to raise their lead in the final moments of the game, but McGregor's excellent defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow could reach his position in the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who became Rangers' substitute, also demanded a penalty break after taking it with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanakka: Geigermeter inventor
Next page from our "Sunday Morning" diary: September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of a device known as a geigermeter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the meter is also a key concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado's Watches", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans portray quite livestock-influenced scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger meter. It's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put the headphones on your ears, you can really hear the effect of radioactive radiation on the minerals.”
Evans: "Look, it's really rattling now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
An invention that bears his name still lives.
New Cancer Vaccine Able to Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Able to Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells and Destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and altered in the laboratory
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to “see” the typical proteins for many cancers
Dog vaccination has yielded promising results in different cancer patients.
For example, the cancer cells of a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months of being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In this method, the resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the typical HER2 proteins that are common to many cancers. The transformed cells are finally injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, United States, describes the method: "Based on our results, this is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "controls the growth of several cancers," explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer as well as eating of the ovaries, lungs and colon."
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was hit by critics after scolding Trump on Saturday Night Live.
The show did not go as planned.
Kanye West got his throat swooped in Saturday Night Live entertainment after President Donald Trump’s blatant style and announced his ambition to run for president in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song "Ghost Town" on the night of Trump's "Make America Great Again" campaign, West attacked Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man, they ask me how I can support Trump because he’s racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have changed America a long time ago,” he said.
The broadcast of the evening began with a sketch in which Matt Damon appealed to Brett Kavanaugh for a hearing in the Senate Judicial Committee, which relates to the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford of Kavanaugh's sexual harassment.
West was not featured in the live broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it to a clip on social media.
It's unclear whether Rock's intention is to ridicule West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had been mistreated in the scenes because of the hat he held in his head.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told not to go to the stage with this hat on my head.
I've been bullied!
Then they still say I’m on the margin,” West said in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see what it means to be on the margin?" and says that he's wearing a Steelman-reference because "then you can't order my actions.
Try it with love.”
According to the variety, West's comments whispered to the audience at least twice, and the show's performers seemed embarrassed. One of the attendees described the situation to the magazine as follows: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West was chosen to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion among many viewers by presenting the song "I love it" as a Perrier bottle.
West is supported by the leader of the Conservative TPUSA organization, Candace Turner, who praised this courage on Twitter: "KITOS WE ARE LOOKING ROSCAVES".
However, Karen Hunter, a supporter of the talk show, tweeted that West "is only herself, which is a wonderful thing."
“However, I can decide to be a supportive person (by buying this music or clothing label or by supporting this ‘art’) which I consider to be a harmful ideology for my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us,” he added.
He said on Twitter that he had changed his name to “a person formerly known as Kanye West.”
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician here follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The second rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later to an artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant smuggler is charged with murder
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after being stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in the Ballyhackamor area.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast court on Monday.
The charge shall be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Actress Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wrenching heroine role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, Harrington has attacked the stereotype of the male hero: according to the 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Harrington suspects that "something has gone wrong" and questiones the means available to intervene in the toxic masculinity of the <0x23>MeToo phenomenon.
Harrington, who also recently became a star of the Game of Thrones, also married to 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admits that she has a strong desire to intervene.
“The question of where we’ve gone wrong with masculinity at the moment gives me strong feelings,” he says.
“What has men been taught in the years of their growth, which has led to the problems that are now visible?”
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He goes on to say, “What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets to make young boys feel that they have to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how can we change this?
“Young people have something really wrong with them.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the production of the pre-game or sequel after the series ends next summer, as he has, in his own words, "taken enough of the battlefields and the horses".
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells the story of the filmmaker and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife Rose was the best thing the Game of Thrones has offered him.
"I met my wife on this show, so somehow it gave me my family and my life to come from there," he says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the love object of Jon Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series by Harrington.
The couple was celebrated in June 2018 with reservations by the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: New Infections Increase by 14% in China
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to the health authorities, the virus affects the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a shift to previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through contaminated blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the conference in Yunnan province, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
However, a year later, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infections through sex are an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women because of the country’s conservative values.
Many diseases are caused by insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to ensure the general availability of HIV medicines as part of the measures aimed at solving the problem.
Maxine Waters Denies Employee’s Information of a Republican Senator Who Leaked, Accusing the Spread of “Dangerous Lies” and “Confederate Theories”
U.S. House Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that her employee had posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia’s pages about them.
A Democratic spokesman from Los Angeles said the claims were spread by “right-wing” commentators and websites.
“Wars, lies, and more detestable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to reports, the home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina, and of Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, representing Utah state, are reported.
An unidentified person posted information about the U.S. Congress on Thursday during a hearing by the Senate Committee on charges of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundits and RedState reported that, according to the Hillin Newspaper, the messages were posted from an IP address connected to the Waters office and by a person belonging to the Waters staff.
“This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and it’s an absolute lie,” Water said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised because of these false and false accusations, is not responsible for any form of leakage of this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and absolutely false.”
Waters' statement quickly became critical of the internet, and critics also included former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“The way he denies this is very hostile,” Fleischer wrote.
"It seems that his character does not suit a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to be hostile.
There's no reason for the threat.
There is no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
We need to be calm and calm in this situation.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters' seat in the congressional elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
“I can’t believe this is true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that he had contacted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies for these deceptive allegations.
"We ensure that the perpetrators are disclosed," he continued, "and that they are held legally liable for any or all of the destructive and dangerous actions committed against some or all of my staff members."
Johnny English strikes again – Rowan Atkinson’s underpowered agent parody
It has already established a tradition of looking for Brexit references from any film that is slightly about Britain, but this does not seem to fit into the Johnny English agent parody and action comedy series, which began in 2003 at the Johnny English border and reawakened in 2011.
Can the language of the nation’s satire in the pulpit become Britain’s new national export success?
Either way, the clumsy, clumsy and incompetent Johnny English has earned his permission to do some research already, and his name tells us above all that this is a comic creation aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
It is, of course, a distant secret agent who desperately seeks to breathe the glamour that melts around him, but appears to be a mixture of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and the unfortunate one-night musician at the London Opening Concert in 2012.
The character is based on a silky chaos left behind by a cosmopolitan and mystical world-man whom Atkinson originally presented in Barclaycard’s now forgotten TV ads.
The last presentation has a moment of time.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor's plates collide with his helmet.
Atkinson’s physical comedy presents come out, but humor itself seems subtle and strangely unnecessary, especially because ‘strict’ movie brands such as 007 and Dangerous Task are now offering humor as part of the film’s core content.
Humor seems to be aimed at children, and Johnny English’s confusing touch doesn’t seem to me to be as clever and sharp as Mr. Bean’s Atkinson softcore comedy.
The point of departure every year is that the UK is in a worse situation.
The cyber-hacker has become infected with the UK’s top-secret spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents on the ground to intimidate an agent in service – which is portrayed as the unfortunate small role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is already in the midst of political inequality: Emma Thompson is doing everything in the face of Teresa May's parody, but the script just doesn't give her enough space.
When intelligence advisers inform him that all the spies on the ground have been revealed, someone who has already moved away from the active service must be called in.
Of course, this is a joke about Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement days as a teacher at a fine school, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the art of espionage. The subject highlights some nutty jokes; English keeps school of rock-type lessons in a survey.
English is credited with holding an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he meets again with his endlessly patient fighting partner Bough, who is still playing Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander whose role Vicki Pepperdine doesn't seem to have access to his rights.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty's secret service to confront the fateful supercriminal Ophelia Bhuletova, portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, and Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough turns into a farce of the same path: a double masked waitress sets fire to a fine French restaurant and causes chaos while trying to hide the luxury of Volta.
Even the last obstacles of the perpetrators are stalled at the end of the attack, but despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still feels like a bit of a children’s audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
When watching Johnny English movies, I’ve come to the same conclusion: why can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would make justice for his talent?
UK Labour Party Denies Plans for a Four-Day Work Week with a Five-Day Salary
The Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but pay a salary of five days.
The party is told to demand from business leaders the transfer of the savings produced by the artificial revolution to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend with the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would “fit” for the party’s economic programme and its plans to increase the cost of politics for the benefit of the workers.
The Union of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A source from the High-Level Labour Party told the Sunday Times: "I was informed of the revision of the line before the turn of the year.
The change does not take place in a moment, but a four-day working week is a goal that is consistent with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the workers, as well as the party’s general industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the Green Party of Britain committed itself to endorsing the transition to a four-day working week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective does not get indivisible support in the Labour rows.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not a party line, and the party is not considering a transition to that."
The shadow government’s finance minister John McDonnell took advantage of the work conference last week to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from “faceless dictators” and “conceptors” of public-interest companies.
According to the Shadow Government Finance Minister's plans, the current shareholders of the water companies would not be able to get their shares back in full, as the Labour-led government could implement "reductions" on the basis of the abuses detected.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of directors of companies and to create exclusive ownership funds that would transfer 10% of the share capital of private-sector companies to the management of employees. According to the plan, an individual employee would be paid <0xC2><0xA3>500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
FBI judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for at least a week on Kavanaugh's appointment as Supreme Court judge, and the postponement also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could hamper some Republican Kavanaugh supporters.
In the 60-minute episode on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to find out things that could change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said in my hearing... I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called her when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked her, “Did you do it?”
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
Instead, Graham’s voice seems to be stoned.
"I've made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it's a bomb promise," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one of the people he has named has been able to confirm this.
This is a 36-year-old case.
I don’t see what could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, which will be held in New York on Saturday, is a musical event with a performance map as impressive as its mission: eradicating poverty from the world.
Now for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival will attract tens of thousands of people to the New York City Central Park grasslands to listen to performers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real goal of the event: from extreme poverty to the age of 20.
Started in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people actively working to eradicate poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform a variety of tasks or "acts", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the political decision-maker, or calling, or performing any other action of the project.
But how has Global Citizen been successful now that it has been 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert ticket a real way to convince people to take action, or is it just one ‘clickivism’ among others – the idea that you can change the world by signing a web address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen reports that it has booked more than 19 million "actions" for different targets since 2011.
These actions have prompted political decision makers to announce commitments and principles that amount to more than <0x24>37 billion and have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements on the basis of which more than <0x24>10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the resources achieved have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
The main commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives operating in the UK, which is committed to "helping children's development to their full potential700.The group committed to delivering <0x24>35 million to Rwanda, which was a major global subnutrition of <0x24>4 million.
“Thanks to the UK government, donors, governments of different countries, and just people like you, we are able to transfer the history of social injustice and malnutrition to the press,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the public at the 2018 London Concert.
The group also called on the UK government to take steps to improve the nutrition of mothers and children through more than 5,000 acts. The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which focuses on combating malnutrition, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the most frequently asked questions on the movement’s website is, “Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen’s response: “The road is going to be long and difficult and there are many compass stones ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, like major civil rights struggles and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, because together we are stronger."
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host a concert in New York this year, and its chart includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
U.S. Department of the Interior says the country could make it harder to export energy by using its fleet as a "blocker"
According to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner, Washington could "if necessary" rely on its fleet to help prevent the spread of Russian energy in the world markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia’s activity in Syria – at the invitation of a legitimate government – is an excuse for the recognition of new energy markets in the region.
“I believe that the reason [Russia’s] presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just like in Eastern Europe, the southern hemisphere of Europe,” Zinken said.
According to the exporter, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
“The United States has the ability to keep the shipping routes open with the help of its fleet and, if necessary, the islands to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up in the global market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the public at an event organised by the Energy Consumers Union, a non-profit group that stands out as a "power consumer voice" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it was the same thing.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less fiction, and the replacement of fuel by another,” he says, describing Russia as a “one-stop circus number” whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statements are scheduled to take place in a situation where the Trump administration has sought to increase its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
To strengthen this, the Trump administration, including President Trump, are trying to convince Germany to step down from the “incompatible” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which President Trump says is tied to the Berlin-Moscow-link.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the 110 billion cubic meters of capacity of the pipeline in use, to be a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that there are purely financial reasons behind Washington’s opposition, and considers it an example of unhealthy competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier,” Russia’s Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has provoked a response in Germany, which has strengthened its commitment to the project.
The country’s leading industrial ceiling organisation, the German Central Industrial Union, has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is very problematic that a third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Union, said recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts intends to think carefully about the terms of the 2020 presidential election.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she was “thinking carefully” about becoming presidential candidate after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering his candidacy at an open questionnaire in Hollywood, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to move to Washington and fix our wrong administration, and this also means a woman at the top of the kingdom,” she told The Hill.
“After the sixth day of November, I am going to carefully consider establishing myself as presidential candidate.”
Warren assessed President Donald Trump on the occasion, saying that "he's taking the country in the wrong direction."
“I am concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has appeared in direct criticism of Trump and this Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
According to an opinion poll published Thursday, however, the majority of Warren's voters do not support this condition in 2020.
According to a study by the Suffolk University Policy Research Institute and the Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts don't support a senator's position on the condition.
32% voted for the nomination.
Several of the respondents voted in favour of former Governor Deval Patrick’s appointment with a 38% share, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates raised in the debates for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press news agency, Biden has said he will officially decide on his nomination by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war trauma in Donald Trump's election
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq when he was recruited to the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son will have to go through when he returns home, I can be very similar to other families facing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries our returning soldiers bear,” he told a public meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the detention a ‘strength in the living room’ and said his son, like other veterans of the war, would “go home a little bit altered, they will return hardened, they will return to wonder whether we will respect what he and his comrades have done in the army and in the air force of this country.”
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, where he was charged with domestic violence and abuse of a woman, as well as domestic violence and gun handling, according to Dan Bennett, a Wasilla police spokesman.
18 states and the Federal District of Columbia support a new lawsuit against asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Federal District of Columbia are applying for an amendment to the new U.S. line that states that asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Eighteen state and federal officials have issued a letter to Justice Friends in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers who violate the line, according to NBC News.
The full name of the business owner has not been disclosed in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit, which was raised by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal lineage.
He tells of his partner "and of his violent gang boys" who abused him, and the U.S. authorities denied him asylum 20.7.
He was arrested in Texas.
Grace-supported prosecutor-general described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, most of which are U.S. asylum seekers, as countries where gang and domestic violence is a widespread problem at all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed the decision of the Board of Appeal for Asylum Applications in 2014 that undocumented immigrants were able to apply for asylum on grounds of domestic violence.
Attorney General of the Federal District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new line "should be ignored by the states, the federal and international law for decades."
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be resolved on the basis of application-specific facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the letter of law "Friends of Justice" states.
Prosecutors also claim in the letter that the practice of preventing asylum seekers from entering is damaging the U.S. economy, as the incoming ones are likely to become entrepreneurs and "come the necessary additional workforce".
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend the granting of asylum for victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is intended for persons fleeing their home country because of persecution or fear caused by a particular class of society, race, religion, nationality or political opinion," Sessions said on Saturday, June 11.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue of survivors continues in Palu – the number of deaths found has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she satisfies her hot baby at an evacuation center in the ruined town of Pula.
"Ambulances are bringing new bodies every minute.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their stolen goods and try to save what is still to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged in a 7.5 magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Army hospital, where patients are treated for persistent, severe post-concussion.
His eyes are filled with tears as he turns his attention to how an angry earthquake ravaged the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We couldn’t be saved.
I fell into a compression between the ruins of the wall, I guess." Harris told the Associated Press, and he said that he was in the city of his family for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "provocating" "propaganda"
The U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper that overlooks the conflict between the U.S. and the U.S.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid annexe in the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the congress on November 6.
Trump’s accusations of Beijing’s attempts to interfere in U.S. elections mark a new milestone in Washington’s expanding campaign to pressure China, according to U.S. officials.
While it is normal for the foreign government to distribute announcements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are at present engaged in an ever-escalating trade war, in which both sides in turn impose customs duties on the counterparty's export products.
According to Chinese and American experts, China’s revenge tariffs were targeted at the beginning of the trade war on states such as Iwaa, which supported Trump’s Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa State, says Beijing has done damage to the U.S. working population, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
“China is now accelerating its provocations further by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press,” Branstad wrote in a statement published Sunday in the Des Moines Register.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government will benefit from America’s valued free speech and press tradition by placing a paid statement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In Beijing's street newspaper sections, however, divergent opinions are only limited, and actual, divergent opinions, which Chinese citizens may not see at all about the alarming development of their economies. This is because the media is strictly in the hands of the Communist Party of China," he said.
Branstad goes on to say that "one of China's largest newspapers did not publish an offer" in his article, but not exactly what the magazine is about.
Kavanaugh squad expels women voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the Republicans’ scorns stand behind and defend Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s candidate, can lead to a response, especially in the upcoming midterm elections, according to analysts.
Emotions surrounding the incident have taken place in large circles, and most Republicans have already expressed their desire to move forward in the vote.
“These things cannot be cancelled,” states Professor Grant Reeher of State Studies at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell Institute in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher doesn’t believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republican, Arizona)’s last-minute offer of an FBI investigation will soothe angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and spokeswoman for the National Reform Group, MoveOn, in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "the coming of November" as they expressed their opinion as Republicans in the Senate Judicial Committee decide to move forward in Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reports.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be appraisable,” said Stu Rothenberg, a committed political analyst at the news site.
“People say that the excitement has already been high, and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially for uncertain women voters in neighbourhoods and younger voters, ages 18-29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Analysts predicted a possible counter-reaction if Republicans progressed with confirmation even before Ford’s testimony speech against the Supreme Court’s candidate, in which he claimed he was sexually harassed.
“This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put to interrogation. It’s about how Republicans have acted on the matter and how they have treated Ford,” said Guy Cecil, head of the Democratic-supporting group Priorities USA.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided in whether they should believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh in the leaning of a small majority to the latter.
According to a new YouGov poll, 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony is absolute or likely, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent say they think Kavanaugh has probably or absolutely lied to his witness statement, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
With Flake pushing the matter forward, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh voluntarily harassed him when Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee revealed to him his genealogy as a student while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet Against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their information is stored and who has access to any information.
In an interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that Inrupt is intended to "govern the world".
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his startup company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store" or POD.
It can include contact lists, memory lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of a personal data repository is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it "personal enforcement through data".
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and required skills to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently includes the security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some contracted developers working with the project, as well as a community of volunteer encoders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website. All of this is available from this week.
Berners-Lee says he and his team will not discuss with Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete change, with all of their business models being turned over in a single night.
"We're not asking for their consent."
In his paper, Berners-Lee, published on Saturday, Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for the unity and quality of a new network built for Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the Internet at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology University of the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee retains his position as the founder and leader of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute even after Inrupt was launched.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of networking,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The City Remembers the Hero of the First World War
The city celebrates the only priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross Medal of the Church of England, who has served as a soldier for 100 years.
The Urhoolism Medal was awarded to Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 for the events of the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt villages.
Vann died, however, four days later, without ever knowing of the highest honor he received by the British Army.
Two of his grandchildren were unveiling a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "impressively symbolic"; the memorial was revealed just 100 years after his award-winning grandfather's funeral.
According to the London Gazette, 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quent "very dense fog and under heavy field guns and machine gun fire."
Later, he collapsed on the front line and "provided the highest degree of virtuosity" led to the advance of the troops before their own sights on the field. In the following battle, Vann dropped three patter soldiers with his own hands.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann died on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s work was “something like I could never achieve, something that arouses respect.”
Michael Vann He dropped off with his brother Dr James Vann after a parade by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it's a "great honour to take part in the parade" and added: "The great crowd is remembering the honor of a true hero."
Friends of the Free Match waited all night watching the Bellator 206 tournament – TV channel showed Pipsa Possua
Imagine a situation where you’ve been watching all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and the entire event is not presented.
The San Jose event programme consisted of 13 matches, including six main series matches, and the show was scheduled to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in the UK.
At six o’clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the cycle of the program, Pipsa Possu became a big shock to the audience.
Some of the spectators weren’t really happy watching the game overnight.
A friend of the free game opened up on Twitter describing the game as replacing children with a "something sick joke".
"According to the law, the content in question was not suitable for presentation at 6 a.m., so they had to switch it to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior assistant director of marketing and communication for the program.
"Pipsa Possu, yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said the schedules will be worked out so that UK viewers can monitor events in the future.
"I'm thinking of retransmission, which will probably make the program work," Coker said.
“But it’s 6:00 a.m. there, and we don’t have the show before Sundays our time, which in turn is Mondays at their time.
We're working on this.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, the messages began to go in one direction and the other, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
This was not the case, however, but it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you that next time this will not happen.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer more to our fans and we tried too much.
This is a bad situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels Low for Sexuality
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete says he only noticed when he was in high school that “not everyone is the same as me.”
Speaking on Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, Lauren Laverne, Daley says she spoke about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also explains how winning the Olympics was no longer so important after having a child.
Kristy Young, the regular host of the long-term radio program, has taken several months off due to illness.
While performing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt like she was younger than everyone else because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and jobs."
“Until today, these feelings, feeling smaller and different have been reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I needed to succeed,” he says.
She says she wants to show that she is ‘something’ so that she won’t disappoint everyone until her sexuality is finally revealed.
A double Olympic pro-democracy activist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he will be present at this year’s NGO competitions calling for homosexuality to be criminalized in other countries.
He said that he came out because he feels lucky to be able to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
A three-time World Champion says he fell in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “to be a surprise.”
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age gap has never been a problem.
"If he experiences so many things as young" - he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - "it is difficult to find another same-aged person who would have experienced similar co- and counter-collections."
The couple got a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of which Daley’s “whole perspective” has changed.
“If you asked me last year, my life would have been about winning the gold medal,” he says.
“You know, there’s even bigger things than an Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic medalist."
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said her father never accepted that she would die, and one of the last things she asked Daley was about tickets for the 2012 Olympics.
“I couldn’t tell him that he won’t be here anymore to be at the forefront,” Daley says.
"I held her out of my hand when her breathing stopped. Only when she had really stopped breathing and she was dead, I finally realized that she was not invulnerable," she says.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew this was something I’ve dreamed of all my life — jumping in front of the home crowd at the Olympics. There’s no better feeling,” Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for her first song selection — the song "Proud" by Heather Small — that aroused emotions as she prepared for the Olympics, and that still gets her skin on chicken.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Semi-finals for Mickelson at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup lap, but he must be peeled significantly to avoid a record lap remaining as an unfortunate performance in history.
Mickelson, who plays in the event every two years for the 12th time in a record-breaking event, was transferred to the exchange bench by Captain Jim Furyk for a fourball and a foursome on Saturday.
In general, a five-time Major tournament winner, who is the focus of attention, has now spent half a day as a cheerleader and the other half on the field trying to get his shot in possession.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who has not even been considered one of the most accurate drivers at the top of his career, is not the ideal choice for the tight Le Golf National, where a long-running squirrel punishes inaccurate hits.
If there is not enough opposition to Mickelson on the field, Sunday's ninth game against the British Open is the precision-famous British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who plays alongside the winner Tommy Fleetwood, whose goal is to place the tube of all four wins this week.
If Americans, who are four points behind 12 doubles, get a flying start, Michelson’s game can prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but nothing else could be said.
"He fully understands the role he played today. He stabbed me in the back, routinely and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is undoubtedly one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he would play two games.
I imagined something else, but that was how this went and we came to a solution like this.
He wants to be on the field as much as anyone else.”
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldon's record for several Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can also mark the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, which was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, but according to Furyk, his presence brings something undefined to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, smart, he likes people at the expense of messing up, and he’s the fun guy everyone likes,” she explains.
"The youngest players had a lot of fun with him this week, and it's fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game.”
Captain Thomas Björn of the European team knows how long the leadership position can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the huge leadership role of the Ryder Cup before the last day’s doubles can be a journey.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros led the side with a five-point lead over the Americans, but who survived winning with the calcification line just by his nose and won with the narrowest possible margin.141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2
"It reminds us of how hard we drove in Valderrama, we drove hard in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, albeit small," Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team's 5–3 wins both on Friday and yesterday in the National Golf League 10–6.
History will show both to me and to all the other members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We'll go to the field and do everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we only aim for it.
As I have always said, I’m focusing on these 12 players who play on our side, but we’re aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
“Congratulations on how his team’s players have done on a difficult field, Bjorn adds: ‘I’ll never be down until I get into things like this.
Tomorrow is a completely different thing.
Tomorrow, individual performances will be the priority, and then we will talk about different things.
It’s great to be on the field with your partner when everything goes well, but when you’re alone on the field, the player’s capacity is tested on the grounds.
This is a message that must be conveyed to the players – tomorrow everyone should be able to perform best.
Now we have to give up a partner who also lets him go [to the field alone] and do his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, Captain Jim Furyk will require his players to perform better as individuals than they could as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk, in turn, has experienced the final day's full turns in both directions. He was part of the team that won in Brookline before he ended up losing, when the European team won "Medinah by a miracle".
"I remember every bad word," he replied to the question about how 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw threw the rows of his team into the last day's homes.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like it happened in Brookline, or like it happened in Medina.
When it moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We've arranged our assembly accordingly and we're putting the boys on the field the way we want, as you know, we're going to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the defensive fight and he faces Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next in order to face their European opponents.
"I put the team's guys in this order because I think it's going through the tournament," Bjorn said in a statement.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The newest frigate of the German fleet should have been launched in 2014. The ship is intended to replace obsolete equipment early in the Cold War, but it will be introduced by the beginning of next year due to faulty systems and explosively increasing costs, local media say.
According to a military spokesman for Die Zeit, ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the deployment of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class has been postponed for the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems have haunted the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the outdated Bremen class frigates.
According to the available data, they are equipped with efficient anti-aircraft and surface-to-surface missile systems, as well as vanishing technology, such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic signal detection technology.
Important features of the ship also include its longer service range – new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting home ports.
Continuous delays mean, however, that the warships that are at the forefront of technology – which are said to be designed to improve German influence in overseas areas – are already outdated by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit magazine.
The bad-earned F125 frigate ended in titles last year when the German fleet refused to officially launch the ship and returned it to the shipyard of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned the ship after its delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media has spoken about the essential "software and hardware types" that make the warship unfit for combat missions.
Software shortages are particularly important because the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class ships is about 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet's capabilities for later updates.
The Rhineland-Palatinate with a capacity of 7,000 tonnes is believed to be twice as heavy as the equivalent class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, there is also a problem with the cost of the entire project.
The price is said to have risen to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion when the original price was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the introduction of new frigates have arisen as the German naval power has recently been warned of a decline.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, said earlier this year that the fleet's ships "are running low".
According to the Authority, the problem has grown over time because old ships have been decommissioned, but no new ones have been delivered for them.
He complained that no Baden-Württemberg-class frigate could be deployed.
The Environmental Organization Is Listening to the Secret Life of Squirrels
A new study in the Scottish Highlands region aims to find out how the ducks use the land in hunting for food.
The new study is expected to bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to guide them in future protection measures.
A study by the National Trust for Scotland, conducted by scientists, monitors drought and duck packets, as well as earplugs and water spikes at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
The study places special storage devices at important points in the region to monitor the activity of the sheep during the period.
Employees and volunteers of the organization also perform mobile measurements using portable detection devices.
The frequency of the votes, as well as the species at each time, is ensured by the analysis of experts.
Based on the results, a habitat map and report are created, where the behavior of the rodents can be presented in a picture that suits the region’s scale.
Rob Dewar, the organization’s conservation adviser, hopes to reveal the results, which areas of the habitat are most important to the habitats and how different species are exploiting them.
Information will be helpful in the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of dams and the management of forest areas, taking account of the habitats and related species.
Scots and the whole of the UK’s leopard populations have declined considerably over the past 100 years.
Construction and land-use work threatens the resting places and habitats of the slums.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as mosquito paper and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pets.
In fact, the squirrels are not blind.
However, due to the night hunting methods, their ears are more useful in catching than their eyes.
Pigs use advanced all-round detection technology to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is a rural environmental organization that maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land – and they take shelter seriously.
Its service includes ten experts, who carry out regular surveys, checks of resting places and, in some cases, rescues of animals.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only shrine for the protection of sharks in the county of Dumfries and Galloway, with eight out of the ten shark refugees in Scotland.
According to David Thompson, the area is ideal for rest.
"Threeave fits very well for squirrels," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and overall a good living environment.
We don’t know everything about the Pacts yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us better understand what the Pacts need to succeed.”
He stresses the importance of inspecting buildings in case of orphanages prior to initiation of renovation, as the destruction of one orphanage may inadvertently cause the death of up to 400 female orphanages and boys and destroy the entire local population.
Reptiles are protected animals and the killing, disturbance or destruction of their resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish worker for the Protection of Sheep, encourages the public to participate in protective work.
He says, “We still have a lot to learn about our settlements, and we still don’t know how their populations are going to be.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing a case against a German newspaper.
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape charges against him as "false" and says people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have filed allegations to bring the German magazine Der Spiegel to justice.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid the victim <0x24>375,000 for silence, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram for 142 million followers just hours after filing allegations. The 33-year-old footballer vehemently rejected the allegations and described them as "disgusting".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it belongs to this profession.
I’m a happy man and everything’s fine,” the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to challenge Der Spiegel on allegations they have called “invaluable reporting on suspicions under privacy protection,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player is demanding compensation "for mental suffering according to the severity of the violation, which probably means the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan are told that they met at a nightclub and moved to the player’s room where he is allegedly raped analyzing it, according to papers submitted to the Nevada Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo has fallen on his knees after the alleged event and said he is "99 percent a good guy", but "one percent" caused disappointment.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple has had sex, but that it was mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later concluded a settlement because she was "horrified of the possibility of revenge" and worried "that she would become the subject of public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says he is now applying for an annulment of the conciliation procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to relocating to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged Manchester United overrun, and moved to Italian team Juventus with a <0x24>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain 'shoots to regret for ever' the end of car production
Britain would “fall forever” if it lost its position as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, Minister of Commerce Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" Toyota's UK unit's announcement to temporarily suspend production at its factory near Derby in Burnaston if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese automaker says the impact of border alerts is visible as job losses if Brexit ends without a deal.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota Auris and Avensis are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other parts of the European Union.
“My experience is that if the UK suddenly withdraws from the EU at the end of March, our factory will be discontinued,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers operating in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about the withdrawal from the European Union in how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini factory for a month in the wake of Brexit.
The main concern, according to a report by car manufacturers, concerns the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a non-contractual Brexit.
Toyota’s production line will be rotated on time by the JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers from the UK and the EU, and cars are manufactured on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause border disturbances, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and difficulties.
Keeping a warehouse at Derbyshire for more than 24 hours is impossible, according to Toyota, and production would be discontinued.
Clark said Theresa May’s EU relations plan was “exactly calibrated to avoid these checks at the border.”
"We need a deal. We want the best deal possible, which not only means success in the current situation, but it is an opportunity that we are taking advantage of," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
“Not only Toyota, but also the opinions of other manufacturers show that we must definitely be able to continue the very well-functioning supply chain series so far.”
Toyota cannot tell how long production should be stopped, but warns that the additional costs should reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and works as a supplier of trade unions at the factory, says among the growing members of concern: “In my experience, the lost jobs never return.
A spokesman for the Government said: "We need to present an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein may be "returned to move in another week" to the supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia’s interference in the elections, the ties of Trump’s assistants with Russia, and the president’s possible actions to obstruct justice.
In Washington, there have been rumors for months that Trump intends to separate the Assistant Justice Minister, which would jeopardize Mueller's investigation's impartiality.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported on Rosenstein’s discussion of the possibility of recording secret talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of the president’s dismissal under U.S. Constitution Supplement 25.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was told that Rosenstein had resigned from office.
However, President Trump was on a visit to the United Nations at the time in New York, so the date of the meeting was announced Thursday.
Trump said he would "not like" to separate Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its time coincided with a Senate Judicial Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate plenary vote.
Trump's head of the press, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said: "There is no date set for this. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed for another week due to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court at the moment.
But I always want to keep the press up-to-date."
Some journalists may disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Newspaper Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reason for the lack of press conferences was due to reasons other than opposition to the "attentiveness" of TV journalists, but said: "I do not deny the fact that they are attracted to attention."
However, Sanders made it clear that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more interrogations than any president before him,” he says, and without further evidence, “we’ve revised those numbers.”
"Press conferences will still be held," Sanders said, "but it's infinitely better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We are often trying to act in this way, and you have seen us acting in this way many times over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open events or press conferences with valued individuals.
Presentation alone in a press conference is rare.
This week, in New York City, the President may have shown the reason for this unobstructed and occasionally oddly-looking journalists.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to workers of the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) from EU countries regarding concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to employees of the Scottish healthcare system from EU countries to express their gratitude and hopes for their stay in the country after Brexit.
MEP Jeane Freeman sent a letter when the time left for the UK to leave the EU was less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already prepared to cover the costs incurred by applications for the "established status" of EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes: During the summer, the separation negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
The Government of the United Kingdom has also strengthened preparations for a possible non-contractual separation.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much we value each of our employees' contribution to citizenship, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie for Emergency Surgery
Tennessee State Tigers supporter Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team lost 31–27 Vanderbilt to the Commodore on Saturday, Tennessee reporter Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State Chief Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before midnight.
“He came to the side and just slipped into it,” Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the lateral boundary before setting him on pairs and taking him to the lateral for a more detailed assessment.
A Tennessee State reporter told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been discharged from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type/range of injury at this stage" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays for the first time on a team from Illinois after his transfer.
He had five rounds on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 rounds this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK. Additional money will be spent according to the new plans of the Conservative Party to help homeless people.
The aim of the amendment is to neutralize Corby’s success in attracting young voters
Increase of the stamp tax applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will inform foreign buyers today about a higher stamp tax rate to be paid when buying properties in the UK. Additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby’s efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper apartments and paid attention to the taxation of incomes.
The tax increase is aimed at people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money from this will be directed to government action to ease the distress of homeless people.
The additional fee – which is added to the current stamp tax in addition to the increases in second-family and investment housing two years ago – can be up to 3%.
The Finance Minister expects an increase of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s new buildings will be purchased from non-UK residents on a regular basis, which raises prices and makes it difficult for buyers of primary housing in the real estate market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK – especially in its capital – have become ‘the city of dreams’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new lineup comes just weeks after Boris Johnson introduced a tax cut to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land and not building it, and called on Prime Minister May to reject quotas for affordable housing to remedy Britain’s “residential embarrassment.”
Corbyn has published a series of appealing proposals to reform the housing market, including restrictions on rents and the end of "confidential weddings".
He would also like to give the boards more power on matters relating to the construction of new apartments.
“Last year, I said I planned to own my prime minister’s British dream – that every generation’s life should be better than its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be true that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, can buy homes as easily as hard-working UK residents.
Too many people have dreamed of owning a home too far away, and the shame of homelessness remains a reality.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland's national team"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "first goal" is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is thrilled with the challenge of bringing the team back to their home corner, currently in third place in the second division of the UK.
Ross moved to the Lights Stadium this summer after directing St Mirren back to the Scottish championship last season.
“As a player, I wanted to play in my team.
I got into the second team and it was there," Ross told BBC: Scotland's Sportssound.
“As a child, I often watched Scottish games with my father at Hampden, and it’s something that has always drawn me back.
Such an opportunity will only come if I succeed as a follow-up manager.”
Ross' predecessors to Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about getting into the boots of his famous predecessors in the nameless company. He has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
“At the moment, I am measuring my own success by whether I can return this follow-up to the league.
Based on the structure and ability of the club, it is undoubtedly part of the league,” he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just consider myself a success if I got the confidence of the team back in the league."
Ross has only served as manager for three years: first as Deputy Head of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heats coaching team.
Afterwards, he helped Alloa get out of the three-series downhill games and elevated St Mirren's downhill team to championships during the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his playing career in the teams of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academica.
“I was probably in a real pioneering relationship with my career,” he recalls the time when he became Alloa’s leader.
“I really thought I was better suited as a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, earned moderately well and enjoyed some relatively great successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player must learn a variety of things every week.
I’m still going through the same things, like stress and pressure from work, but running a team feels like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to lead a team, and now I’m doing it for my job. I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life.”
The entire interview can be heard on Sportsound broadcast on Sunday 30.9, Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy the steak is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., research shows
The summer heatwave has kicked off pubs struggling with Britain’s difficulties, but at the same time has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% in July, but revenues of restaurants declined by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, said: "Continuing sunny weather and England's expected longer participation in the World Cups meant that July was the same as July, with a 2% increase in the sales of pubs, compared to June.
The fall of 1.8% in the sales of restaurants only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the drink side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in restaurants sales.
Food-sided pubs also suffer from helms, but less dramatically than restaurant rowers.
Looks like people just wanted to get out of their mind drinking.
The sales of pubs and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% over the month, and the sales of food fell by 3%.
Paul Newman of RSM, a consulting company in the leisure and hotel restaurant sector, says: “The results continue with the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
The weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors influencing the sales of the market for out-of-home dining.
It is no surprise that the fight for restaurant chains continues, although the annual sales decline of 4.8% is sparking, especially now that the industry is struggling with cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come to a worse swamp for food-focused operators, and only time shows whether August brings the lowest temperatures in the industry to the desperately needed breathing season.
The combined total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new open restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is the next barometer for UK pub, bar and restaurant sales, which collects and analyzes results from a 47-sector group with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. It is considered to be a reliable meter in the industry.
Five-fifths of children hide social media accounts from their parents
Fifty-five of children – some up to the age of 11 – hide social media accounts from their parents and teachers, according to research
Research involving 20,000 high school students reveals the existence of a growing ‘Instagram fake accounts’ phenomenon
The news raised concerns about the possibility of sharing content on accounts of sexual harassment
Twenty percent of students say they have a ‘final account’ that is shown to their parents.
Fifty-five of children, some of whom are up to the age of 11, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed the existence of a fast-growing ‘Instagram fake accounts’, referring to the Instagram site for sharing images.
The news has raised fears that the accounts will be able to publish content about sexual harassment.
Twenty percent of students said they considered a clean ‘final account’ to show their parents while using other, private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenage boy who hoped to be raped after colliding with his 13-year-old daughter’s secret site.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Board of Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two separate profiles, and half of respondents admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan says, “It’s alarming that so many teens are attracted to creating online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle's "Voice of Athletes" to the Scottish Athletes' Government
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-government member of the Board of Scottish Athletes and will attend the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Scottish President Ian Beattie describes the nomination as a great opportunity for sports decision makers to benefit from the athlete’s wide-ranging international experience during the last decade.
"Yesterday's athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally are highly respected. I am sure that the Scottish athletes would benefit greatly from his appointment to the government," Beattie says.
Doyle says, "I look forward to my role as a voice for athletes and hope that I can be useful and help guide Scottish sports in the right direction."
Four Olympic gold medals won by an American athlete, who won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and now serves as a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his ability to walk as a result of a transient brain disorder.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time shows, how well and how well.
This has been a tiresome job, but I’ve completely recovered, learned to walk again and now I’m already training for kettering!
“Thank you for your encouraging message!”
Advertising moms like cows share opinions online
Breast pumping company’s breastfeeding mothers have shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, a consumer technology manufacturer, has launched a product called "the world's first silent and wearable breast pump", which is accelerated by the use of language in a pocket and a music video-style advertisement that describes the new pump.
Four real-life mothers dance in the henna-filled navels, among other things, with the following song: "Yes, I lick it myself, but I can't see it" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not ugly, they're tits."
The story goes on: "Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, leak my findings."
However, the ad on the company’s Facebook page triggered a conversation online.
The video, which has collected 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has provoked conflicting reactions among viewers, many say it spoils the daily ‘horrors’ of the dairy industry.
"Using lambs to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
They have to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth,” writes one commentator.

Another spectator commented: “It is, of course, traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why can’t they be used to advertise breast pumps for mothers who are allowed to keep their baby?”
The third commenter added: "Perfect reality-packed advertisement."
The ad also got defenders: a woman admitted that the ad was "horrible".
“I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one if I still breastfeed.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a great product,” he said in a statement.
Another viewer commented: “This is a fun ad that is aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the bathroom) and ‘feel like cows’.
The purpose of this advertisement is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the ad, the women in the video reveal that they have danced unnoticed pumps in their chests.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast pump feel like cows.
Instead, the Elvie pump is completely silent, it has no wires and hoses and it is imperceptibly fit inside the breastfeeding loops, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go outside during pumping.
Ana Balar, a participant and artistic director at Mother’s Advertising Office, commented: “The Elvie pump is a transformative product that deserves a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers and lipstick cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump to the light bulb, we brought out the incredible freedom that the new pump brings in in an entertaining and identical way."
The Elvie pump has ended up in the titles before.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk wearing the product by designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in all silence
The number of immigrant children detained has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policy of the Trump administration has made it difficult to place children in detention families.
Traditionally, most settler families are made up of paperless immigrants, and enrolling in a settler family may endanger their own country of residence.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential family members and other adult members of the economy would have to give their fingerprints and that this information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, the High-Level Immigration and Customs Authority, testified last week at Congress that the agency detained dozens of people who had applied for asylum for minor immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no previous criminal records.
"Almost 80% of people who are either members of the local family or members of their households are illegal in the country, and most of them are criminal aliens.
So we're going to keep looking for these people," Albence says.
In an effort to deal more quickly with cases of children, the authorities have introduced new rules, in which in some cases the case must be dealt with before the court within one month of the arrest, rather than within the 60-day period previously in use, according to the staff at the reception centre.
Many people prefer to appear through videoconferencing rather than in person in the court on matters relating to immigrants.
Those who are not considered to be entitled to help will be expelled quickly.
According to reception staff and reports published in recent months by the system, the time spent in child custody affects whether children are beginning to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
According to lawyers, concern is particularly emphasized in larger facilities, such as the Tower, where signs of child despair may be ignored due to the size of the facility.
They add that moving children to tent towns without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for it or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many of the children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria Orders U.S., France and Turkey 'Development Forces' to Exit Instantly
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the country’s eight-year war.
Moualem, who also serves as Prime Minister, said foreign troops are illegally in the country using an excuse to fight terrorism and that "with them we will act accordingly".
"They must resign immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem said the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and since, and where millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue a "holy fight until the entire Syria is cleared" of both terrorist organizations and "illegal foreign troops".
The United States has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding Kurds and President Bashar al-Assad’s Arab counterparts.
France has invested more than 1,000 troops in the fights to tear the country apart.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good for the return and accused "some Westerners" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
“We have called on the international community and aid organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They’re politicizing something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria until the end of the war has been agreed by a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity for political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the territory of three million people.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters on the border of al-Nusra, linked to al-Qaeda, "who will be destroyed".
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of the new government and opposition committee to create a post-war draft Syrian constitution and level the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to "revision of the provisions of the current constitution" and warned against interference in the matter.
Why Trump Will Be Elected for Second Period
According to this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the formalization and scandal will end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic decision of the presidency ever!”
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in spectators.
Since 2014, the best viewing time figures have more than doubled with CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled with MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Fox News, Nielsen has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best viewing time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show has reached the top 3.5 million viewers on cable TV.
"This is a mess that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," ABC's Chief Executive of Designated Survivor program, Neal Baer, said of the minister who rises as president after the attack on the congress building was destroyed.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, is another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was voting for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
Chaos is worth having fun.
Unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can, of course, determine how Roe vs. Wade happens, whether members of immigrant families can access each other, and how the global economy can.
Unselfishness is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet goes beyond the duties of a conscious citizen to look at a six-hour expert panel that argues about Bob Woodward's use of the source data for the Fear book, Paul Manafort's <0x24>15,000 struts-shouldered pilot robbery (Trump's <0x24>15,000 struts-shouldered robbery) and Daniel's "indictment" of the presidential claims.

“What he’s doing feels like a real TV show, partly because he’s giving the audience something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Panty Loan Company series, about changing people on the Trump show.
You can't leave a single episode out, or you'll fall off the wagons.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a wonderful sunny day on the north coast of Kauai, but he couldn’t go out because he watched MSNBC while filming CNN.
He could not withdraw from the program where Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs and was the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a joke, but they were right.”

External flow of money for a tight intermediate fight
It is no surprise that the 17th Pennsylvania constituency has faced a real cash flow, as due to the restructuring of the congressional constituencies, two candidates already elected will have to fight from one place.
This recently rearranged Pittsburgh constituency is a battle challenge for the Democratic Conor Lamb, who took its place from the second constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb will compete with Republican candidate Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s old 12th constituency, which is overlapping with the new 17th constituency.
The division of territories was re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old electoral district favored Republicans against the Constitution.
The competition in the new 17th constituency has launched an economic campaign in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name became popular in Pennsylvania after the March special elections in the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional Circuit.
It had been Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the region by 20 percent.
Political commentators have given Democrats a great lead.
U.S. plans to punish El Salvador for China’s support, but retreats from its intentions
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and Washington’s mild response.
President Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to call back U.S. diplomatic leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on the basis of ruthless lines that Taiwan will no longer be recognized in Taiwan," said U.S. Department spokeswoman Heather Nauzaent.
However, sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have severely affected a Central American state with a high rate of unemployment and mental health.
As internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity, a similar meeting last year seen as a step in efforts to prevent migrants from pursuing to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that the meeting was intended to progress and this effectively decided speculations on the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to give the mid-October meeting some kind of sign as to what weight the administration will give to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three U.S. ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or penalties from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the conversation with three American officials, accompanied by two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke to protect anonymity.
History Teaches
The next inevitable step may be the Special Advocate Robert Mueller’s report on President Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, which is now very heavy evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to investigate whether Trump’s campaign was concealed in cooperation with Russia when Russia interfered in the U.S. election.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump may notice that he is accountable to him just as he prepares to go before his voters again, and that he may be condemned by his peers.
There are a lot of conversations here, and I don't mean that President Trump's loss would be inevitable - more than the loss of similar people in Europe.
We must make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those solutions will determine the length of this struggle.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid the subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history will be rounded to such turning points where the inevitable advancement of democracy will either accelerate or be delayed.
Americans are now faced with a number of such turning points.
What will we do if President Trump separates Assistant Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating Mueller's case?
Rosenstein has been coal-fired since the news came to the public that he had proposed to keep the president's speech secret and reflected on the president's potential inability to carry out his task.
Rosenstein says The Times' report is wrong.
“How do we react if the recently demanded FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh’s actions is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we voting in midterm elections for a Congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these efforts, our democracy will fall into a long and dark winter.
But I believe we succeed because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew and was expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic office.
He survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath lamps on that table decorated with a hacker.
How could I be more than optimistic about the future with this legacy?”

Rangers Graham Dorrans optimistic for Rapid Wien
The Rangers will be home to Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians would give the team a strong position to join the European League's G-Class after a match against Villarreal in Spain earlier that month.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from entering the field this season before Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes the Rangers can use that score as a pop-up for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good response," said the 31-year-old.
“We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and we brought the point with us.
We might have been able to pick up at the end of the win, but overall the game is probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half and we got to the pace in the second and we were better.
Thursday is again an important night in the European League.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game, because their result was good in the previous game, but I believe that with the support of this team we can give everything and achieve a positive result.
“Last year was really tough on my own injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The composition is good and the boys enjoy it; the training runs well.
Hopefully we can now push full, leave the man behind the season and succeed.”
Fear of retirement savings leads to women’s night’s sleep
While the study participants had a clear view of how they hoped to take care of themselves, few had spoken to their loved ones about it.
Approximately half of the participants in the nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the subject for a speech," said Holly Snyder, deputy director of the national life insurance company.
Let's start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them about your wishes in time.
Discuss with the professional and your family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important factor in cost.
Include economic advice in the discussion: advice can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term care financing options can include traditional long-term insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs, or self-sustaining insurance if you have a fee.
Download legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative on the spot so you can appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and make sure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider drawing up a power book to handle your financial matters.
It allows you to assign a trusted person to take care of financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your invoices will be paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Also remember the small details: imagine that your elderly parent would be on his way to the hospital due to a health emergency.
Would you be able to answer questions about her medications and allergies?
Write such information into the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
"This isn't just for financial reasons. Who's his doctor?" Martin asks.
“What medicines are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready.”
He was shot several times with an airgun in Ilfracombe.
The man was shot several times with an airgun while walking home late in the evening.
The 40-year-old victim was Ilfracombe in the Oxford Grove area of Devon when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
At about 2:30 a.m., the police described the attack as a "accidental act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed to eyewitnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, which is expected to increase.
As communications to the area have been disconnected, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the northern part of the municipality of Donggala, which is closest to the centre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Key information about Palus and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
Earthquake and tsunami strike in the middle of the city’s 40th anniversary.
The town of Dongguan extends over 300 kilometres (180 miles) from the coastline of the north of Sulawesi Island.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative area of the province, with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main sectors of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala, are fisheries and agriculture.
Nickel extraction is also important, but it is concentrated on the opposite coast of Morowali, Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, several tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggal.
The tsunami also struck Donggala in the west in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismicly active Pacific Ring of Fire area and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake in North Sumatra on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh caused a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 states and killed 226,000 people on the shores of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the Sumatra West Coast in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the island's southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Sumatran Mentawa, causing a ten-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Surface earthquake hit Aceh Pidie Jaya, causing destruction and panic as people remember the massive destruction caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in isolation.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, Track Palin, has been arrested on charges of bribery.
According to a report by the Alaskan police on Saturday, Pali, 29, from Alaska Wasila, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as for preventing and resisting domestic violence in connection with the arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took a phone call from her female companion, who tried to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su Pretrial prison and is guaranteed <0x24>500, reports the TV channel KTUU.
According to the report, Palin came to court on Saturday and said he was "confirmedly innocent".
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which means he can be sentenced to a maximum of one year in prison and a <0x24>250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which can be sentenced to day imprisonment and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
Palin has not been charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with abuse by his father, Todd Palin.
At that time, Palin’s mother called the police and reported the overcrowding.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, Palini was charged with domestic violence, involving possession of a weapon under the influence of a drug.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of hitting him in the face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for combining her son’s violent behavior with the traumatic stress disorder caused by the service he performed in Iraq.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication connections are off and the number of casualties is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawesi on the north side of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos from the moment of shock are circulated on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at beach festivals in the city of Pula when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors consider imposing the rare death penalty on NYC terrorist suspect
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty in Sayfullo Saipoville, New York City for the suspected terrorist attack that claimed eight lives, a rare punishment that has not been enforced in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, used a Home Depot rental car in October while on a bike ride on the West Side Highway in southern Manhattan, where he was riding on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a statement on the request for the death penalty in New York's southern administration, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors are able to prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, both of these allegations are possible to impose the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court indicted Saipoville for 22 counts, including eight murders to assist the terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this criminal name in cases related to organized crime, prosecution and internal prosecution.
The attack required "significant planning and preparation," prosecutors said, describing the way in which Saipov carried out his work as "destructive, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadtin, Darren Draken, Ariel Erlijin, Hernan Ferruchin, Hernan Diego Mendozan and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the last time New York's southern administration court passed the death penalty.
Respondent Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last enforced in New York City in the 1953 federal case, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed as convicted for a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, did not show any signs of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
He told the researchers that his work felt good, the police said.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to watch ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to a 22-page indictment that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipovi, said the defense was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty rather than recognition and life imprisonment without the possibility of liberation is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused to those involved in these events,” Patton said.
Saipovi’s defense had previously demanded that he not be subject to the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged today in a protest against the Conservatives "to mobilize the civilian army."
Former Ukip president said politicians need to know the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of May's own parliamentary representatives suggested that she lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative spokesman Peter Bone told marchers in Birmingham that Britain would be “already out” if Farage were a Brexit secretary.
But May faces the gaps in her deeply divided rows as she agrees on the challenge undermined by the conservatives who are in a position to stay, linked to a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal on the surface of Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU’s compression.
The supporters demanded that he continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backing - and to force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and the chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to “stop the Chequers proposal to go”.
He suggested that Farage should be involved and should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out there already," he said.
Wellingborough's parliamentary spokesman added: "I am in favour of Brexit, but the Chequers proposal needs to be rid of."
He said: "We have not fought World Wars in order to end up being subject.
We want to regulate our own laws in our own country.”
Bone shunned the idea that public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay is a completely wrong statement."
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is not supported by the members of the party or the activists who are really going to the streets and are responsible for our success at all.
“Create the Chequers proposal and start listening.”
In a message to May, he added, "Prime Ministers will be allowed to keep their jobs while they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians need to feel pressure if they intend to circumvent the decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
It is now a matter of trust between the people and the political class,” he said.
"They're trying to convince Brexit and we're here today telling them that we're not going to accept it."
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are going to circumvent Brexit to feel the pressure on your part.”
“We will mobilize the army of the citizens of this country, who gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until the UK is again an independent, self-governing and proud state.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before a two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists won the "Tories Against Brexit" awards. The group was founded this weekend.
The Labour Party’s Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives about the security issues they had with the party’s application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they're getting IT systems in order and all the technology for Canada plus plus arrangement and unbreakable border functions for free trade in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a total farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported on Saturday that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, meets with Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren is expected to face Trump in the 2020 election.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters since the start of Trump’s term.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that now it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest position."
Arrest in LSU's Sims shooting case
Louisiana's Baton Rouge police said on Saturday they had arrested a suspected LSU basketball player Wayde Sims for Friday's shooting.
Baton Rouge police said Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. during an ET briefing.
The police had posted a video of the Friday shooting and asked for help identifying the man who appeared there.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus area early Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to his head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted that he had been in interrogation, held a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not act in the arrest and was taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a 198-cent junior player who grew up at Baton Rouge, playing 32 games and 10 starts last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 disc balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Cup with team arrangements after offering him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedek's squad squad arrangements played an important role in the competition.
Bottas got a good start from the ball and left Hamilton almost on his own luck as he defended his place in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel went to the barracks first and left Hamilton to drive with a bunch of hands, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went on a lap of the lap later and returned to follow Vettel, but Hamilton passed away after taking a little contact and the Ferrari driver reluctantly resigned from the inner line defending his investment after two thirds of his move.
Max Verstappen, who spent his 21st birthday, started the ladder and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the competition in extending the tyre change as he aimed at a quick termination and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikköse.
He finally came to the ranks in the 44th round, but was unable to increase speed in the remaining eight rounds when Räikköse took fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri was doing great all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional career, achieving a double win," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language.
President Donald Trump on Saturday mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that he did not make public Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking on the occasion in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was a sign of people's "innocence, ugliness and dishonesty".
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate over the last few days, when we saw the bullying, people who are angry, evil, ugly, and dishonest," he said.
“When we see the publications and the stuff that’s covered and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you keep this information up?
Do you remember his answer... did you read the document - 'Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't run away."
Oh, wait a minute.
“No, we didn’t run away,” he added.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing the allegations against Ford Kavanaugh and the letter was released in September, but Feinstein denied the leak had occurred from his office.
“I didn’t hide Professor Ford’s accusations, and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential according to his wishes.”
But his ban did not apply to the president, who commented on the matter on Saturday: “Let me tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the supreme court’s candidate, which three women have accused of sexual harassment, and considered the Democrats’ use of accusations to their advantage.
"They have decided to return to power by whatever means.
“You see that wickedness and ugliness, they don’t care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars claimed compensation against Belfast Giants on Friday for losing the Elite League game by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Gants had an early lead thanks to the two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home team levels before Dwyer returned to the Giants leadership position.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald scored two goals.
This was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefen's men, who won the Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams faced three previous matches after the Giants won for the fourth time during the season.
Dwyer's opening goal came at 3:35 a.m. from Kendall McFaull's innings. David Rutherford entered when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the short opening season, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt entered the Cowns match at 15:16.
Dwyer secured Giants' lead position at the end of the first set of his night's second goal.
The home team rounded up their rows and Bouchard leveled again with superpowers in a time of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcora joined forces, and Nielsen was able to make the first lead of the Dune at the end of the second set. He also secured the win of his team's fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches to their home on Friday at Milton Keynes.
Flight driver dies after making sure hundreds of passengers on board escaped from earthquake
In Indonesia, the pilot has become a hero after his death, ensuring that hundreds of passengers transported by the plane could safely get into the air.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a severe earthquake and the tsunami that struck Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong aftermaths are testing the area, and many people have been left in the mess of the collapsed material in the city of Palu.
Although his co-workers fled by trade, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his work at the wildly moving flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He kept his seat and made sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, was safely airborne.
Then he jumped out of the flight control tower, which he thought was going down.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesian spokesman Yohannes Sirait said Agung’s decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News said in a statement.
From Kalimantan Balikpapan, a helicopter was prepared to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“This news is breaking our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear the death toll will increase to thousands, as the country's disaster authorities have reported links to the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutonga.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise, as many bodies have been buried in the ruins and not many people have been reached," Sutopo Purwo, an agency spokesman, said.
Even the six-metre-long waves have destroyed Palu, where mass burials will be held on Sunday.
Soldiers and freighters bring aid and equipment to the area.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: <0x23>Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, the head of Indonesia's International Red Cross, said in an interview with CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what awaits us.
This is already a tragedy, but it can turn out to be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the country's armed forces: "I ask all of you to work night and day so that all evacuation tasks can be carried out.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesian airstrike: Air Niugin says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
Representatives of the airline in the Pacific Lagune in Micronesia now report that one person is missing, although all 47 passengers and crew members were reportedly evacuated from the safe drowning plane.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to locate a single male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was trying to find the man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information on missing passengers, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people remained in the hospital on Saturday and all were stable.
The cause of the storm and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both announced that the plane has landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was on the highway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to dive in a floating plane in deep water for emergency exits.
He told the passenger crew that he was panicking and screaming, and that he himself got a slight headache.
The U.S. Navy reported that seamen who were in close harbor repairs were involved in rescues by transporting people to the beach on a rubber boat before the plane sank into some 30 metres (100 feet) deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not joined the crashes.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor completed a retreat in which the man was charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of data analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the information stored on his cell phone when compiling a 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the victim’s death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones, indicating that Tellis was against his earlier claims with Chambers on the night of his death, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers at the same time that Tellis claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, police interrogated Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was "deceiving because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to know Chambers about two weeks after he died.
Based on the data stored on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The final speeches of the defence are scheduled to be launched on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What do you need to know about hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions of the genre by making music that is full of positive messages.
According to the Bristol band The High Breed, hip hop is far from the original, whose messages were related to politics and social problems.
They want to return to the roots of hip hop and make the familiar hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have witnessed a new rise in Britain with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark one?!
New York babysitter calls on couples for racist texting
A New York babysitter challenged the couple's discriminatory divorce after accidentally receiving a text message from the mother of the child complaining that he is "one more dark".
The couple denies being racist and compares the challenge to "distortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her grief when new babysitter Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first day of work in 2016 and told her that it was dark.
"IIIIII, TAAS TUMMAIHOINEN", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent a message to Giselle Maurice twice instead of her husband.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman had separated Maurice from the New York Post, stating that his former Afro-American babysitter had done his job poorly and this time he had been waiting for Filipinos.
Maurice was paid for one working day and he was sent home by taxi.
Maurice is now appealing to the couple for compensation for the separation and wants <0x24>350 a day for the six-month period for which she was originally washed to live and work in a family, but without a deal.
“I want to show them that this cannot be done,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have responded to racist claims that Maurice’s termination of employment was a justified solution because they could not trust him after insulting him.
“My husband sent him something he wasn’t going to say.
He's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post in an interview.
“But would you leave your child to notice someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was just accidental?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco faced the challenge of chanting and said that his wife had had had a baby two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation."
“Will we start chasing others in this situation?”
It’s not very comfortable,” the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, outlining their behavior and logic.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Were Afraid That Audiences Were Not Equal to Talking Bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, says of the letter: "It is difficult to live in the position of a person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It's interesting now that Paddington's huge popularity is known."
Recognizing that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before dedicating himself to writing children’s books about the adventures of the toy bear, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books, the father’s birthday was over.
Paddington was "described as a very important family member" and said his father was silently proud of his success.
“He was a pretty quiet man, and not at all a tyre-like guy,” she says.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; one you're proud of, even if it's not really your own achievement.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
"Even though it was his creation, he always honored Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
Her daughter was tied to the plane after landing at the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“They called a little bit and told me the situation was really bad that he wasn’t expected to survive,” says Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called and said my daughter is going to die in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The medications that doctors used to keep her heart running gradually disappeared from her body.
He had died a little earlier, and now it's all gone.
I could just sit there knowing that it was all over.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together.”
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who died from the loss of his daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers - who knew nothing about the trial she was currently undergoing.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down, and your tears are shining all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a great deal of sympathy for Nadia.
That he now needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.”
Women Send Cards to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones are working to stop other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a phone number to get support.
Davis's son Tyler became depressed at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want anyone’s parents to have to experience the feelings I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook with a contagious sting.
“She was known for her smile.
Everyone said that his smile would illuminate the whole room.”
However, he quit his job before his death because he felt he was “in the dark.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old little brother found his brother who had lost his life.
Davis says he is constantly afraid of the aftermath.
Davis created cards “to tell people that there are people who can go to talk to, even if it’s a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Humphreys has been Davies' friend for several years and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother had died.
“He didn’t say he was down or depressed or anything,” Humphreys said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was in the country on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't take sight contact with them or anything like that."
She says Mark’s death has been a hard trauma to them, but they still have to figure it out: “It breaks the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we just have to go on living and fight forward.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake when the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could really get what he hoped for - a limited investigation in time and scope - we could maybe get a little bit of coherence," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee would "disintegrate" to more insidious supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
The appeal is a matter of timing.
The gaps are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans’ success is as weak as expected, their quest to get the man they want to be elected to the country’s highest court will be difficult.
George W. Bush has caught up on the phone and called senators to let them support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during the Bush era and met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI's report?
The Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, holds a vote.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, so Vice President Mike Pence could blow the game off and confirm his choice to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of strikers falls during Kim
According to the South Korean lawmaker, the number of people kidnapped by North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted South Korea’s Ministry of Unification as saying that the cuts took place last year in 1,127 – in 2011 they took place in 2,706.
According to Park, the decisive factors were the tightening of border checks between North Korea and China, as well as the price increases for human traffickers.
There was no public comment on Pyongyang.
Most of North Korea’s logical trips will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the Koreans.
China treats logicians as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often returns them by force.
Technically speaking, the relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on ongoing negotiations on the nuclear fission.
This was followed by a historic June meeting where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un met in Singapore and agreed at a general level on an effort to achieve nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, banned the United States from seizing its sanctions positions after the meeting.
"Without any confidence from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis, and under such circumstances, under no circumstances will we unilaterally dismantle our equipment first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said this was temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
The actor commented on this in a four-day interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony statement before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied allegations that she had sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford while they were teens.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in control of his feelings, and sometimes he almost yelled and lost his ability to talk about his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democratic members of the committee without calling the charges against himself a "grossive and planned persecution against a person" organized by the angry liberals of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election loss.
Fearosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not able to act in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was partisan with Democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent by his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," Pelosi said.
When asked if he would file a lawsuit against Kavanaugh if this election were confirmed and if the Democrats were to have a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he's currently working," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently working in the U.S. Federal Court of Appeal.
He added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible provisions regarding the health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case, as Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judiciary.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he annulled certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not a good time for a hysterical and partisan person to be sued as a member of the court and we’d expect it to be great,” Pelosi said.
Women Need to Survive Everything
This is a legitimate fire speech that has gone through months and years of anger, and it is not allowed to be held without crying.
"We'll go when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, “I was immensely helped by a woman who was in a leadership position somewhere and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a habit of saying to her partner in a situation where she was angry and started crying: ‘You might think I’m sad now, I feel sad.
I'm really angry."
And then he just went on.
And I thought it was awesome.”
Tears are justified as a path of anger, although they are generally misunderstood as fundamental.
One of my most memorable memories of my early workplace in the masculine office is when I once cried out of wordless rage and an older woman - a cold-hearted boss I was always a little afraid of - grabbed me from the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad, and then they’re happy because they’ve got your mind hurt.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in this presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught off-marriage in 1987 on a boat called Monkey Business and was forced out of the race, Schroeder was very disappointed that there was no reason why he would not seek to become president himself.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates and the least one more was excavated.
Someone called the situation ‘The Snowman and the Seventh Duck.’”
Since the campaign was already long, he was behind a fundraiser, so he announced that he would not leave the race unless he collected <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
I told him that some of his supporters, who gave <0x24>1,000 to male candidates, gave him only 250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was forced into the power of his feelings - gratitude towards his supporters, the system of frustration that made it so difficult to raise funds for voters and not for delegates.
“I could have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the reactions of the press.
"I could have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my graveyard would probably be a memorial.
‘He was crying.’”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The launching of the US-China trade war was overwhelming, and while the battle is anything but a passing, the gap between the countries can benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on China’s main export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week took place with new tariffs affecting goods of more than <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded on the same scale every time, the last time by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on US imports worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has promised to answer the U.S. eye-to-eye style, and it does not seem that the world’s second-largest economic power would be undermining for a moment.
In order for Washington to retreat, it should be given up in its own demands, but public worship for the United States would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts note that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the U.S. trade war can have a positive long-term impact on China by reducing its inter-country dependence.
“A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that start with an economic downturn in either country, and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than page viewers have so far understood,” said Abigail Grace, a senior researcher at the American Center for Security.
Syria’s foreign minister says the country is “ready” for return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation is now more stable and safer due to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
The circumstances now allow refugees to return voluntarily to a country from which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic actions that have taken place in their daily lives and incomes.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be grateful for the assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government did not accept conditional assistance or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms victory of Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States team in final points 16.5 against 10.5 Le Golf National outside of Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown on its own when its Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn scored 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson had difficulties for almost the entire time of the tournament and he hit his starting pitch on par-3 lane 16 giving the match to Francesco Molinar.
Italy's Molinari won all rounds and became one of four players who have scored 5-0-0 since the tournaments began in their current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth came out with a score of 5&4 against Danish player Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
World top player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Spanish Sergio García, became the European winner of the tournament with a total of 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t do anything today.
The year has been hard.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to have this win.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said after winning the European team.
He moves his passionate compatriot Jon Rahmi, who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in individual races played on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to have won Tiger Woods. I grew up admiring him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
You get the statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 big wins and remains second only to Jack Nicklauks.
The U.S. team had difficulty finding roads throughout the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, whose game was high throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S. team said after a failed performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We played for the European team this morning.
We're stuck.
Honour to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with our American PGA and Ryder Cup committee and we will move on.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
We gotta get the hat up.
We met our winners.”
Status of Red tide: Decreasing levels in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to a recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there is a general decline in the number of spreads in the Tampa Bay region.
According to the FWC, more sparse rest areas are reported in the areas of the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The Red tide stretches along the coast for a journey of about 130 miles from Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
Ferries can be seen ten miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but fewer than last week.
Red tide blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
Appropriate concentrations were reported on the coast of Pinellas County last week, low concentrations ranged from high concentrations on the coasts of Hillsborough County, from background concentrations to high concentrations in the counties of Manatee and Sarasota, from background concentrations to medium concentrations.
Respiratory symptoms are still reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Over the past week, there have been no reports of respiratory symptoms in Florida.
