I'm a <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> customer and so it's not a problem for me.
All you need is a number or instructions that I should attach to the package so that you can track it as a return.
I ordered the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> a few days ago... for 249<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
Today it costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>179.
Honestly, I find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way to credit?
I also think that children should not be allowed to take on a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in proportion.
Let’s take a short look, let’s help, let’s bring the bottle, etc.
This is how they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved with.
As long as you can still be a child, I don’t see a problem.
If your K1 is busy for a short period of time and it’s OK for him, that’s good.
You can even determine if this is right for your children.
It's not like he's going to wrap K2 and accompany him in bed for hours.
Legally, it’s probably questionable.
Perhaps that’s why the psychologist’s statement comes.
Because if something really happened like a fire, a breakdown, an earthquake, an alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether that’s a risk you want to take is, of course, your choice ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and although I can still remember almost all the action but I don’t want the title anywhere anymore, maybe someone here knows about it...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caregiver commits suicide by overloading himself with food and going to his predators.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation to his therapists, runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and lands with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned anonymously to go to the suicide site and document and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is implanted a chip that suppresses a center of anxiety in the brain and ultimately puts the patients to their fear in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window another goes to death with intention)
This fear is called “the fight” in the book.
In the end, there was a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the gross act I am pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author/author.
If this action is known to someone or someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh ja, I don't have the password for Wlan available.
I need to contact my husband first.
But that can take a while.
What steps should I take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Child, 4 years old, splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wood splitters throughout the length under the thumbnail (outside).
I've been trying to pull him with a pinch.
Very hard to handle.
Didn't fold and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try it.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Thanks to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locus of the track sizes H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm “sugar cube” speaker next to the sound capsule set.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multiprotocol decoder.
It controls the DCC data format as well as Motorola<0xC2><0xAE>, Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as obvious as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus<0xC2><0xAE>, the decoders register at a suitable digital power plant fully automatically.
It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom<0xC2><0xAE>, the CV values on the main slide can be read with appropriate centers.
For central banks that can only program the CVs of 1-255 there are help registers.
Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also enables reprogramming with the honorable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration of mfx<0xC2><0xAE>-compatible power plants.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin<0xC2><0xAE> brake lines as well as ZIMO<0xC2><0xAE> HLU brake commands or the Lenz<0xC2><0xAE> ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake blocks or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> brake diode.
An ABC tilt-lift automatic allows the automatic tilt between two train stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC batteries.

Omicron: Johnson wants to drive up-to-date vaccination
Increasingly new Omicron cases are gaining politics and science in the UK.
For this reason, all eligible adults in England will be offered vaccination until the New Year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move forward even faster than he has been aimed at in the face of rapidly increasing omicron numbers in the coronavirus outbreaks.
Every adult in England should be given a booster dose by the end of the year if at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday night.
Until now, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will also provide support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
One is facing an emergency in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why vaccination needs to be strengthened urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
"Let's boost now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omicron cases were recorded in the UK, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I'm for everyone to imagine with pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to an e-mail conversation.
I want to respond to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I have searched him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can anyone please help me?
** I’m a foreigner and I don’t want to stop an official from walking.
Conclusion: Everyone should present themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today won’t go.
Obviously, the chair had a non-evident lack of sales.
How can such a mattress damage occur after 9 months?
Just try on the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>.
But it has been working since about.
14 days no more.
That’s why I always bought the last books through the website and then read on the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>.
I bought 6 <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> and wanted to buy 8.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like to add 2 chairs to your order and charge it for me.
[CW] Feeling like I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write here something in detail about domestic violence.
I just need to write something about the soul.
I (21) come in contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
One topic that really bothers me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims are not able to help themselves or think we could not help them.
I understand that we can’t do everything and it’s not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond vision and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of getting the kids out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is, in part, very close to the tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help myself in any case... I know I can't.
But it will never be easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence that is so inconceivably important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What about the series on "League of Legends"?
Many Fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning setup: "Arcane", the series from the League of Legends computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debakel of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Younger Johannes Patrick was abandoned.
Again nothing: for the second time in not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Prior to the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back at the Cup defeat in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our belly."
After the game, however, she did not lay down - but increased again in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Bundesliga.
Even more than the naked result disappointed the way the appearance was made.
A statistic that expresses the whole dilemma is called representative: The three-quota was just once 13 percent, 4 hits (all of the young Johannes Patrick) when saying and writing 31 attempts - more questions?
John Patrick said: “We were simply not focused enough after winning at Tenerife, and we did not implement what we trained.”
That is, to move the ball.
His opponent, Sebastian Gleim, reacted differently: "Winning a tough game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," he said.
"It felt like it was before 10,000 people".
Only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they came at their expense.
Last but not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led the game of his team.
"The best player I've ever coached," Gleim continued.
While in Patrick’s team, the teams themselves failed the runners-up such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and reached up to eight points after they had already dropped 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there is not much time left for hatred.
Already on Wednesday, at 19:00, the giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before also in Ludwigsburg, a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I already signed up a few months ago.
There, unfortunately, all warranties were rejected.
We have been informed by law once again and have therefore written to them again.
We originally signed up six months ago.
It's always like the egg: Max Raabe gets 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of batsmen from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the "Good Morning, Dear Luck" program - if he is allowed to perform.
In fact, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it's not going to be anything.
The planned concert was postponed in May 2022 - "on official instructions" to curb the coronavirus.
Other of his planned performances in the Advent period must first be as it is on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists will then retrace their already delayed dates for 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in North Rhine-Westphalia Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing a lot since he was a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, founded the Palace Orchestra together with Kommilitonen in 1986.
Since then, the Bariton has established itself in the style of Comedian Harmonists with its repertoire of hits and songs.
He has been awarded several times with awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) - just like his hit album "For Women That's No Problem" (2013) - reached second place on the charts.
He made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair tightly curled back and thinking about labels, Max Raabe is no longer to be missed from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good morning, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created due to secession
The new Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has opposed the dissolution of large housing companies, as demanded in a popular decision in Berlin.
“With an abduction, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure,” Geywitz said in an interview with the Daily Mirror.
My goal is to give tenants assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colourful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies, for example, is by the way the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left wants to use an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the popular decision.
If the situation does not relax, however, Geywitz did not exclude talks with the FDP in the Lightning Coalition about further tightening in rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price braking until 2029, a limitation of rental increases in tense housing markets and an expansion of the rental level.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk with the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
With a devastating storm system, many tornadoes have been drawn through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be reported.
The pictures from there resemble a war zone.
On the night of Saturday, several tornadoes in the U.S. have caused severe devastation and potentially claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave a speed of about 320 kilometers of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was hit, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
It alone in the state of Kentucky accounts for up to a hundred deaths, with official figures increasing hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she sold out the <0x23>NAME<0x23> showcase.
That's a shame.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely out of the assortment?
Is there a possibility to order this showcase in another country?
Until when do you sign up?
If delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order !
I understand that, only I can order the ceiling now and send it to Germany, which is in the cart?
I had returned an item or given a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it would come or be edited as I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change promotional terms
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have themselves taken the initiative and offer their employees cash prizes for the vaccination.
With this, they are in line with the <0xC3><0x96>GB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans for vaccination calls - according to the German model - is also expected to increase the readiness for coronavirus vaccinations.
He has moved into a company he’s been harassed.
It doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
Obviously, he didn’t get stuck in his old place, and he was looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time, no matter.
He didn’t like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to the grave!
I’m directing the adventure Over the Grip Pass for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign specially written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the evildoers and their motivations are written, the individual files are designed, and now I am about to write the first adventure and stolper already at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a grain truck from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the next action will develop.
A few miles away from the village, a group of Goblins is set up for the heroes and pull them into a retreat.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabres armed
In the absence of notice, the Goblins lift up the heroes in a hollow path and flank to each three arcs on the left and right arming me, while two with spears stop the movement.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions
The heroes are all unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village school, a half.
Of course, the carriage is gone.
If a defeat is invincible, it is this half that will attack with two of his servants and help the heroes in the battle.
The carriage is still there, everything is great.
What do you think of Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so it’s not just cannon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will certainly embrace many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narrative.
I rebuilt the lamp.
And put it together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back anyway.
If you can then let the backlog come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>.

Will everything be retrieved again or just part of the warehouse?
I am excited by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to take a little breath with this post.
For the first time today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the delayed start and start time was far behind the schedule, the last ten minutes (planned) as well as the championship decision (!) could still be shown.
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has finally passed the race.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Schwarzies has accompanied the difficult situation well about the serious accident.
Then there was once again regular knowledge in F1 with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so they both did not know that one should change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change the tyres when Hamilton received appropriate radio talks on the subject.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
In my opinion, such elementary rules should be known simply when commenting on the F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It’s also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed by rules, both simply have constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
Generally, I don't like the artful commentary style of Roos, but add that it's a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL better.
There are also constant albernities that make both seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee with reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter brings a lot of unrest in the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the ad simply takes over at Sky, in which the launch is Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into the advertisement, as you can listen to on F1TV since only the German soundtrack has to come out without comment immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
While it is necessary to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very timid and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to transmit the F1.
Unironically, RTL makes a better job in the four races that they are still allowed to pass.
So in any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I'd be interested in your opinion.

Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me that it would be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> on 12.12.19.
One of them has already had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front of the chair).
I'm asking for help.
Ventilator pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with oxygen in addition.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via an airlifter.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire plants with it.
If you have a large aquarium, suitable pumps with 2 or more outputs so that you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model, ventilation pumps are also offered to put an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a decor that turns the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound insulated design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet etc. by means of an air hose 4/6 mm and can already be unlocked.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and be installed outside.
If the fan pump sits deeper than the water level, you should put a stop valve between them.
Simply cut the air hose through and put the valve in between.
This would prevent once the water would run backwards, running the water out of the basin through the pump...
If the ventilator pump is installed outdoors, you should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture.
The MK series pumps are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, it is packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the road, it goes very fast.
We just want to avoid a little bit so that no one is voted, just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping industry...of course, there is no stopping Corona here.
Please don't rate as badly, just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the package services.
Of course, you like to shy away from these services, even if we say at the moment that they have a damn hard time
This is also very different regionally.
Don’t be bad to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrests?

Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first American in all, a TV moderator, and four other passengers undertook a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by Blue Origin’s new Shepard rocket system by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in western Texas.
Under a radiant blue sky, Bezos received the freshly-cooked astronauts in person upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit as he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on their way for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named after the Blue Origin rocket system, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were the company's honorary technician Michael Strahan, who had four other passengers investing in their Lavan tickets.
How much they paid for their ticket each time, Blue Origin did not disclose.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father’s mission after the short flight.
He has worked hard in his efforts and has to do everything himself.
She just flew around like this, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
“I’d love to go back to space,” the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometres
The missile system "New Shepard" is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during flight reached an altitude of about 100 kilometres above the ground, temporarily with zero gravity, before the reusable object braked off from large parachutes landed again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres above the earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin’s third crewed all-out trip: the first time in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
In the second of October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in Star Trek, along with former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glenn de Vries and the deputy boss of Aurigy Blue.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject in itself quite exciting and also standing in the lab does not bother me (have already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
I have of course informed myself even before studying about occupational prospects thought at the time but also that I definitely want to study until the promotion and will.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, particularly the prospects of employment.
On the one hand (studycheck etc.) you hear great job opportunities again and again and the job is totally sought, on the other hand you hear again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That is why I would be really interested:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What have you studied/What training have you done?
4) Would you do this all over again?
Thank you very much for your reply!
I’m currently really unsure and I’m thinking about possibly discontinuing my studies in 2022 and training me as a professional computer scientist.
If you have any experience, please write this time as well :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why I have a post on it now.
Not only before the big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in operation with us.
It seems there is also the one before the holidays plus the bridge days.
It was like this: last week, Maria was going to heaven with us, which is called "traveling" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
Last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what went last week?
Stress everywhere.
More loud e-mails that must have been sent before the arrival, order here, everything *unconditionally* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "Next week then" sounds like after so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people want to do as much in a short week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very nervous.
What is this self-explanatory about holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we can’t afford them?
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all so independent.
My question is simple: Are we the Swiss just like that?
Is this our reformed evangelical style?
Do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the party by backing and basteling with her son.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
But until the meditative days, she still has a lot to do: “For the first time I have no gifts, I have to finally get started.”
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the mowers and the re-formation of springs.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 <0xCE><0xBC>g biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny spring.
The majority of spring damage occurring in poultry farming is due exclusively to nutritional defects.
Since the spring is made up of a protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless spring dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the mackerel are based on a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the adverse ratio of amino acids in most plant foods is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be given during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold-water soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft feed.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately it still doesn't work
DDR-Handwerksmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the lok was in use in Schleswig-Holstein and Central Germany, the very rare lok was probably from the redesign proposal of the model railroad, which was probably the result of the remodeling of the model railroad.
A locomotive is located in DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are working on
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive, which would be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co<0x2B>Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager-driven AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens scooters with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
They all survived the Second World War and subsequently returned to the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnwerk Dessau, the machinability of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the central German network was progressively re-electrified, there was an increasing need for locomotives for the heavy goods train service, in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were redesigned, the remaining machines being used as spare parts donors.
Preferably, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are present in larger numbers of pieces, were first constructed.
It was only when the E 94 could be seen that the processing number could not be further increased, the E 95 rose to the point of view of the processing.
[4]First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Waren railway station.
They came to the railway station Halle P in 1960.
They were used in their own rotational plan mostly before coal trains from the Geisel Valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complex control of locomotives proved to be problematic with increasing age.
Thus, it was more often that shooters remained sticking during switching operations.
Then the companion on this locomotive with a hammer and a wooden scissor had to release the shooters again during the ride.
Damage to the driving engines occurred more often and resulted in months-long crashes at the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new construction locomotives in the late 1960s and a significant expansion of the electric operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to abandon old locomotives and most splitting holes, so the E 95 was discontinued.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to occupy only one-man electric locomotives, which, due to the above-mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the driver’s stand, would have resulted in a problem in train operation.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid-1969, the E 95 01 was followed by the last E 95 01 to quit service on 5 October 1970.
Thus, the new designation 255 001 was never used.
Up to the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a heating system at the main railway station Halle.
It took some time to convince those responsible for the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was worthwhile as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the outer design of the locomotives began with the aim of presenting them to a car show at RAW Dessau.
[5] She has since belonged to the Transport Museum Dresden as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotives were internally completed.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive museum is supervised.
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P Traditional Community have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer varnish, with the transformers being checked and five drive motors capable of operating.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Schlesian Mountain Trail and the branching sideways, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
The main area of activity was at first Silesia.
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function good, there are necessary optical reworks at the lok in own work, dusted, with play tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition- possibly the set is also from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMAN
The packaging can have labels and bearing trails.
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle bar is held by two feet.Leaders these are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately faulty produced.
The middle bar does not fit in the intended holder.
So I'm getting new mail.
When will they be released?
No, no flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones from the shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
With me they are not flat
Can I get these sent out?
Hello <0x23>NAME<0x23>, can I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people were lightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Oberbayern.
In addition, an estimated damage occurred in the six-digit euro area, the police said on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with slight smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume a deliberate fire.
Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it will arrive much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To unleash fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin posted a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021
Biontech chief U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin had not publicly stated his vaccination status so far.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend prompted him to do so, Shahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, has published a photo showing how he is getting a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
“For a few months, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me where I’m being vaccinated to counter these false rumors.”
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: “I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a respiratory device for three weeks.
The schoolmate and his family were not vaccinated, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often provoked by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear can only be hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with the German Wave is circulating on the Internet, in which U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
“I’m currently not allowed to get the vaccine myself,” <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said at the time.
There is a priority in Germany when vaccinating the vaccine.
In the meantime, prioritization has long been abolished – and according to appropriate information, the Biontech chief has been vaccinated three times.
Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday night: no more electricity and, in many cases, no heating.
A fire had set off a surge station.
Tens of thousands of people in the Rhine victory circle in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to run out of electricity for around 24 hours after a fire with severe damage in a surge station.
As a result of the fire, the lights went out on Friday night for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The provider Westnet reported that on Saturday, numerous emergency power units were in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely repaired late in the evening.
Firefighters and assistants of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered places of care in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The caregiver thanked the affected people for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless deployment,” Florian Witt, head of primary technology, said in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnet mounts were initially only able to temporarily re-open some pipelines, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company data.
The electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that erupted on Friday at about 7:15 p.m. damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching system in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid circuitry.
There is a need for intensive cleaning and repair work.
Parallel to this, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage plane has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people have had electricity in Much and Ruppichteroth.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been phased in from 21.30.
Since 23:15, the last electricity affected by the outage has also been available.
Over 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies have been in use.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is now important that citizens in their neighborhood take care of the elderly or single people and communicate with the local fire departments when help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The focus was mainly on the construction and operation of emergency power units, the residents of Altenheimen.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care centres were set up in schools for those people who were unable to take care of themselves or who needed power-dependent medical devices or depend on medical care.

In order for the paint to be uniform and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse and dry them with clear water.
Before putting the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 stitches.
You can do this later on the no longer visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first row on the component
Drag the brush evenly stitch next to stitch.
Light overlap of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid sweeping quickly with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark ones might pass through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, there can be unpleasant metal shells when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before installing them.
Original appearances are achieved by the models through the decals or drawing images.
From flags on aircraft to ship names to decorative strips and identification marks on car models: the decals give the model the last hull.
Apply the decals in the right order as long as the components are still well reachable.
An airplane cockpit can be worn or easier to handle before being built into the hull.
Even more important than the right tools such as scissors, brushes and toothbrushes are time-consuming, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and set it straight.
Decals are also called water slides because you humidify their backs briefly with water until the carrier paper becomes dark through the wet.
Then you just shove the picture a small piece of paper and place the piece in the appropriate place on the model (which you have also wetted before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the support paper aside.
Attention: Always check to see if the picture sits right before pushing it out of the paper completely to prevent it from sticking, slitting or scratching on your finger.
Suction the excess water with a household stove.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I do not read the book anymore and I have to unsubscribe and sign up and reload the book and look for the place where I have read.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I receive this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 individual packages with me
ok still thank you!
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money's back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we have been in child-wish treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly crosses.
The order by:
We had applied for the conversion of children’s desires in advance at the PKV and received the promise over 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt directly led to successful pregnancy and childbirth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and conducted 2 (unsuccessful) trials, but these did not yet count on the PKV.
We once again applied for the cost takeover at the PKV and again received 3 further attempts.
After some further attempts (we have carried out more attempts than promised, logically counting the most expensive with the PKV) we reached the invoices at the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2<0x2B>3) the PKV wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the other 2 attempts of the first pledge expire.
The second child's wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to the Terms and Conditions, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the treatment need no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who here is entitled to the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have reminded us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts will fail?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to closed ovaries) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
All right.
We will not order any more from them.
If you add the sales from me and my friend <0x23>NAME<0x23> (same address), you obviously have lost a good customer.
You will be happy to pass this on to your manager.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment was prompted and now tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I can’t believe that the commode is completely disturbed.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear and clear that the refund has been made and I have not yet received a refund by <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>
You can tell your manager that you have lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect did not occur until after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, you may not sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the 24-month warranty applies.
No, it is not possible for me to get another type of packaging.
I will remove the closet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>
These products are advertised with additional hockers to purchase, but unfortunately we can't find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget movie is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits for it.
Wikipedia has to say the following:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting people in this category?
What's bothering you?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much
With Friendly Greetings
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I will give up again soon because it just doesn’t work here.
Hello!
"Half victory" against Belarus linked to high costs for the EU
The EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, the researchers of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP) said.
This floating state - Belarus does not make a very small contribution, but the EU feels the winner - will probably go on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently, there is an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not determined to oppose it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot be implemented if a Member State decides to do its thing," as Poland does today, which does not even allow Frontex, the EU's border protection agency, to access the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: a principle agreement on asylum policy will be difficult as the line "Frontier protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland’s border guards, migrants have once again attempted to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the authorities said on Sunday.
Polish officials were stoned by migrants in the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to reports, a soldier was struck in the face and had to be medically provided by a military doctor.
A total of 52 border guards attempted to cross the border within 24 hours.
Already on Friday night, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU proposes Alexander Lukashenko as a power holder in Minsk to attract them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania have regulated border sections according to press reports.
The EU has sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people’s countries of origin to prohibit departures there.
The most effective element of the EU’s response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
“There the EU has thrown its market power into the balance sheet and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.”
Minsk must also take into account domestic policy costs.
The Belarusian society is unlikely to be set up to allow the security apparatus to regularly squeeze thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
In the opinion of Mercedes, Max Verstappen has committed two rules violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has objected.
The silver arrows suspected two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged breach by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have outdated illegally.
A second objection was raised against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overdone Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes in the last round and had finished his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutch had outdated the car before him.
I'll check that out.
I talk to the bank and report to you again
Thank you for your support

2021, Abu Dhabi: The summit is reached.
Verstappen celebrates his first World Cup title with 24 years in the Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi - with an overhaul maneuver against Hamilton in the final round.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read on Friday the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the night noises at her door.
Yesterday I left the contact form to return an article, but received no email confirmation or similar.

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semitic doesn't mean anything.
It's like a dealer says he doesn't have anything against foreigners.
You will not admit it to both of them.
But colleagues are constantly reproducing some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you just have to let it be complete.
Yes wow then you are just as little to take seriously as colleagues.
Those who are seriously questioning evolution in principle are simply completely lost.
For my sake, a God has put it all in motion.
But once you’re a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science just makes no sense.
And that makes you a science enemy and not to take it as seriously as colleagues
In order to get an optimal field of vision, the lupe should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the lupe practically without distortion and color errors up to the edge zone.
Often lupes are marked with enlargement indications.
However, this information applies only to precise conditions that rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your lupe, please take into account the instructions in the "Technical data" table (see Instructions for use in the package).
Light reflections are generated on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, i.e. even in the case of impact valves.
By means of an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When the optimal conditions of use are met - lupe close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (in German and English).

Tanning sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Tiers has already experienced some curious situation when selling tannins.
Once upon a time, a man is said to have gone home without his partner, because both could not agree.
Each year, he plants about 2,000 seeds.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a curious situation.
It always makes the pre-Christmas season a little funny, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now I pay the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spike.
And so both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "reverse", which by far does not sound so tasty.
Problems with Glass Fiber <0x2B> Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiberglass connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have trouble building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbits without fail up to a few failures.
The new fiberglass connector sends 500 Mbits to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also arrives.
However, the other DLan module, which transmits the Wi-Fi, no longer reaches the full 500, but the more I remove myself in the house with the module, the less it comes (i.e. using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces away from the other module).
This means that the internet with the new fiberglass connection is now on the first floor even slower than before (<0x7E>45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here.
Could anyone explain to me why glass fiber "lost" so much internet speed over the power line?
Is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely difficult to relocate the house LAN cables.
I’m really disappointed, which is why I created an extra account here.
That’s why I’d be more excited about an answer.
When is the time to change the Giro account
Who would have thought, now for the first time, would be quiet with the giro accounts, looks deceiving.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the charges of the past with all the tricks from their customers, the free amounts for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous for a long time with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just cut the free amount in half and even quartered it for the day’s money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Postbank Group’s savings group – to 50,000 euros for Giro and Investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower free amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesman on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already fallen to a 50,000 euro limit, which is still in force, as was the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts to two levels, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Verivox Internet portal.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in first instance have even got right before the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
Banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly make deferrals - in the event that the upper instances also declare the negative interest in principle inadmissible and have to be repaid to many millions of bank customers.
The table was supplied for 8 people instead of those for 6 people.
The basement is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, was named the most influential woman of the year by The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who made furor in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she gives herself a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a ONE chip out of the bag).
The fact that the hearts of the female and male fans still fly to her equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has trouble with luck – and is still looking for great love.
And the baby's wish has been removed from the list.
She was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what’s going on with me personally, medically, why I can’t.
It was really hurting.
Hopefully, success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Raikonen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen’s farewell from Formula 1 went quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled out the gloves and wiped the sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a light tyre touch, Raikkonen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finishing his career in the motorsport king class.
To say goodbye, his wife Minttu and the two children travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen’s greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He scored 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in Zweierbob - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bob pilot.
"I figured it out once, I had to win nine and a half wins per season, then I could do it until Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner from BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two victories in two days at the Winterberg races.
It was only on Saturday that he defended Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundred sets, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed the material setting slightly, and on Sunday, he took a larger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he settled in front of the British Brad Hall.
The third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also brought his 22nd victory in the series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, finished second this time in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race in eighth place.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it too," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte won the third season in the second round.
After finishing fourth in the Monobob the previous day, she raced for the World Cup on Sunday with German three-time winner Deborah Levi.
BRC Thuringia’s Mariama Jamanka came second with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she won the first podium this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium in the World Cup, I’m super happy that Mariama takes me with me.
I am super happy with the development.
There’s still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times were okay today,” Burghardt said, stressing: “It’s not just pushing, there’s a lot to do around.”
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely error-free rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't get it and so I can't redeem it why I've finally asked for it.
Last year I had very different problems with Corona and never had time for it.
And now he said that he had expired, which annoyed me very much.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare seat bank.
I would like to return it and then order it again as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
It was taken away by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And do not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello, lovely girls and girls and women,
I have a few things I just want to write, and maybe one or the other will do that.
I am 24 years old, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mama - except that my dog does not scream or walk into kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I think I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have kissed a lot and it was nice.
I helped him in the shower (because the hand is in the band wg burning).
It is also cooled and we are currently seeing ourselves less (1-2x week) which makes me very happy with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy has just had a stomach, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cushion ceiling and has relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and sneezing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just been gone for a month.
There is also a lot of homework coming to us, which we naturally divide.
But cooking myself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just fine, I’m halfway well treated and I can cope.
Not good, but I get it and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet and tomorrow anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no place anymore.
So my week goes like this: Until tomorrow, then it’s weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Only until his birthday.
Just before the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And that's how it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these mental tips because otherwise I'll pack it up.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't do it...
Is that what you're saying?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can’t say that in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think that also has something to do with Mental Load of Women and that's why I thought I'm sure I'm going to find some passionate comrades here...
I certainly wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.<0x23>NUMBER<0x23>.
The other two times.
But it was not confirmed.
At the time, I found out in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God, and for them it is just another subject like mathematics or geology.
It was always a little strange to me, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed in some way.
How do you feel about it?
Perhaps you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional, and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it's just strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Culture or something?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can't change it or not?I like to write in English too
It's been a long time, then I'd give up
That's good, thank you.
I’ll be waiting for a feedback by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support <0x23>NAME<0x23>.
Movie Search Help Please
Hello, my dear people.
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (bin 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
In the film there are two axis (or parallel worlds).
First, the modern (real world).
In other words, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not entirely certain).
Since I can’t describe it in detail anyway, there’s a young woman in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Caribbean).
For some reason, the roads cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live on its own.
The transition is also, I believe, the graveyard of the soldier.
In the end, both soldiers fight each other, I believe.
If that tells you something, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one slept only on the belly from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child like that holds much more than you think.
Make sure everything is right around you, no cucumbers, go in and look more often, but no minutes of monitoring.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Axo and ours didn’t have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he is sleeping.
Does it turn the head sideways?
Is it possible to get something out of the stomach?
Or is it directly in the mattress with the face in front?
You can find out if everything is okay.
We’ve all grown up, and when my husband was born, it was going to be fun to put the kids to sleep.
In addition, we are already "Stamm customer" with you and have already purchased many items
But why are you offering me only <0x24>20?
Hello, I wrote yesterday with a colleague of you and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: <0x23>ALPHANUMERIC-ID<0x23>).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The closet is not currently in use.
To be very clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know, not everything can be kept.
I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply that the policy of this broadcaster is now under all odds.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big bed tour at the same time.
It has been said that you are an “independent” Internet transmitter.
Arno: You want to be "no running lith foot column".
What are you now?
An 0815 advertiser trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marahs Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, they apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to offend people.
A crocodile who is completely lacking empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How to find all this right?
Great if you like it, I find it scary.
I ask for a call call since my supplied wooden table has been defectively assigned.

Whether as a comforter for abdominal pain or just for coughing – my little heat friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for beneficial heat applications, since cherry kernel heat can absorb very well and deliver dosage again.
The removable inner pillow can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly comfortable so that the little ones feel safe even when they are not doing so well.
The cherry kernel cushion with reference is suitable for the following applications only as a thermal support:
Before warming the pillow, check for atypical odors, stains or burns and get rid of them immediately if they are present.
Please remove the inner pillow for heating in advance from the cover!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (note the microwave manufacturer's specifications!)
Directly after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by stirring!
Then put the inner pillow back in the reference.
During the first heating, a light moisture formation can occur on the surface, but it disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to adhere to the warming instructions given, as longer periods of time or higher energy performance can cause damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that the heating of cereal products is allowed in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the heated inner pillow has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitable for babies (maximum 43 <0xC2><0xB0>C) on your armrests!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, blood clots and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
If you have skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour disease, as well as a pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores have emerged, remove the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored during use to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable in the machine at 30 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working from the table basement.
For Ingolstadt, it does not run under the third coach.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this one about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough for the operation.
Bad display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply plugged in.
After that I expanded the battery, but nothing is done here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network mode?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> to the room.
How can I book?
I am interested in the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> chair.
I don't know how high the seating area is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design!
20 liter capacity also absorbs larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely hidden using the padded FlexFold splitters.
And whatever else you need in everyday items, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior remains well organized and segregable from the photo equipment.
With the "Update" of Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series is still presented in a new look.
The stylish, minimalist design has it in itself – with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: once conventionally via the cover valve, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
In this case, a metal closure hook with suitable anchor bars is located in the closure valve on the front side of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account various "filling stages": there are 4 anchor bars, which are permanently destroyed, in which the closure hooks can be crocheted.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Folding closure and hooks are also magnetic.
In this way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without hitting the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid valve, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of conventional backpacks with access from above – you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday habitability of the backpack: not only when you bring your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel baggage.
In the Everyday backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more below) and thus easily store both separately - and access it independently through the two side openings.
In addition, you can pull the backpack from the right side of the body to, for example, access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday things stay safe in the left half of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable support belts help in this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
I am looking forward to the email from your support.
<0x23>NAME<0x23> sent me an email yesterday confirming the appointment of the

I haven't received a message so far.
I'm asking for immediate settlement.

This is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom <0x23>NAME<0x23>
Is it necessary to know when the cabinet can be delivered again?
Keeping him that way is not an option for me...
It's working.

If you renew my voucher, I will immediately place a larger order, but after all, I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that last year was different from what I thought I couldn’t guess and I just couldn’t redeem it in time and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotating brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of braking can be appreciated even under difficult conditions.

The tuned discs manufactured in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
In addition, the openings created increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, with the sections improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake discs.
The aesthetic features of our tuned discs underline the character of each car by its attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glittering cracks in the water on the southern slope of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” from '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were cut apart, tents were laid up, and salons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country’s wealth.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river runs and surrounding areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to overcome your pioneer colleagues in order not to get along with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, you have to keep up with your resources and build a tableau that is more and more "working" for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional promotions, or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge boards, you can use fine customizations to develop your individual playing style.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
When a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables half of the location – reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players alternately perform actions, such as gaining resources, moving carts, setting up tents, browsing rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolver heroes.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the prize holder turns to a new location and thus changes the available promotions.
This goes on until the pricer has moved five times, so each location has covered once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players must defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they get less rewards or end up in the cemetery.

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychic violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a nice guest in talkshows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he triggered a fierce educational debate.
Ex-patient:inns and educators are now raising serious charges against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people are thinking and acting differently.
Our parents and other leaders must never, never, ever, ever, ever, be in power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as possible and meaningful in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shocked.
Holetschek: Countries advise on elimination of test duty for triple-vaccinated
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a federal-wide waiver of the test obligation for triple-vaccinated people.
"We countries quickly need clarity on whether and from when three vaccinated can be exempted from the test obligation," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, the "image on Sunday".
The drop of 2G plus for triple vaccinations is “not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccine incentive,” Holetschek said.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers Conference on Tuesday. <0xE2><0x88><0x92> afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What's the best way to do it?
Hello, I like the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seating area is.
Can you continue to help me?
I can no longer make a purchase using my <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>.
Advertisement: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping goes through the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> page on the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What could this be?
What you describe is referred to as *awareness*, i.e. sense perceptions under full anaesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
Most often it comes to hearing sounds/voices, less often to see pictures and most rarely to perceive pain.
Relevant to this topic: cesarean sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anaesthesia is avoided to protect the child up to the abscess.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned in the narcotic pre-conversation.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, however ** u/Nitemarex **per definition did not.
I read your comment wrong.
The chair is defective.
The <0x24>20 doesn’t help us either.
These are statutory warranties.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the faulty chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check to see if you can at least remove the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I've already sent you an email that you haven't answered.
Again the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarder is company <0x23>NAME<0x23>.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver in front of the door - because of <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don’t know anyone who can wear the heavy furniture on the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had formulated a question
Theatrical historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an insider.
Later he wrote a monumental theatrical story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is the new book on the table, print-fresh: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell from the world, which led the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle to April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author is dead.
The last sentence in the book is, "I already bear witness here to my life thanks."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardized wood pallets, which are mainly used in the European area as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
In 2020, according to statistics from Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually will not be collected

Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips for the perfect gulach here a week ago.
It was on Christmas Day and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I’ve come to taste and I want to cook roulette for the first time in New Year’s Eve.
Tomorrow I'm going to set up a cattle fund for that.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>?
My English is no longer so good, but I get it
It is about a refund of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC><0x23>NUMBER<0x23>
I was already informed by email on 18.01 that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money has not come to me.
Would you please check it out?
Where there are still Christmas sandwiches in the Lübeck area
For many people, gans or ducks belong to Christmas days such as the pine tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any chickens yet?
Now the time is running out.
We will tell you where you can get another Christmas snack in the Lübeck room.
The "drive" of a pipe end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controllers, you can adjust the desired level and the volume of your sound.
In addition, the VT<0x2B> Series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and the distortion.
Furthermore, it has already been said that with the POWER LEVEL controller, you can even float a power reserve when it goes off loud.
The POWER LEVEL controller enables the full potential of the VT<0x2B> series to be used in any situation.
The headphone socket can also be used as a line output.
This signal is processed with a boxing simulation, so that even when using a headphone or direct recordings, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you donate a VFS5 foot button, you can easily call the sounds on foot, turn the effect blocks on/off, and tap the speed of the effects that are compatible with it.
For live betting, this is essential.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen it so with others.
Is it possible to send the lamp back to you?
Because she's hanging too low for a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you continue to help me?
And the commode?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> chairs?
If it doesn’t, I’d be happy with a discount or voucher.
In some cases, I find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over <0x24>1,000 for goods that I don’t need is a lot.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> mirror (door) on the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time is not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran Sees Progress in Negotiating Nuclear Agreements
In the negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement, progress is being made according to Iran.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief merchant Ali Bagheri told Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" because at first there was not even consensus on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement aims to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement were resumed after almost a week’s interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia will take part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia surpasses Saxony - Free State now the highest incidence of coronavirus
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in the state.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was above the 1000 mark at the Corona Incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which last had the highest incidence in the state, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within a day.
200 severe Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are barely coming back with the detection of new cases.
I understand that.
Since delivery will only take place in early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it and paste it on the package and post it at the post office, that was or?
I don't have to click/please fill out anything else here?
That’s exactly what I want to avoid, that’s why I’m writing to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a freak in my eyes.
It's time for change
<0x23><0x23><0x23>Bundestag you are welcome to me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
<0x23>Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, one can see one thing: it is not exquisite.
We came to a winter star and extended the summer hole to a few months.
<0x23>Where is the problem?
Yeah, where's it located?
For the most part, this should simply be related to the dissatisfaction, how some things have happened here and how we are in general.
In recent days, there has been a growing impression that many people here really still have bock on MBundestag.
<0x23>What we need to change
At this point, the community is asked around the MBundestag who wants to keep it alive.
The trigger came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found one, simply to say, sherbenhaufen.
After some write-ups, several people from the community have found themselves eager to rebuild the project.
However, once again I would like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way this project can still exist in the future.
To do this, we have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange with each other, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> How will MFD work in the future?
* What existing orders need to be changed/adjusted/removed?
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> How are we going to act outside in the future?
* How to recruit new members?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot a few things, but what's not bad is that we finally have the disagreement.
If you have time and desire, come to the discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clogged for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered another suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the <0x23>NAME<0x23> is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>, there are also oversized ones, so in 240/240 for example?
<0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be retrieved in time.
And I ask you to make that happen now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the closet for picking up as much as possible - you need to clarify with <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> how this can then work.
<0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there any instructions for installation?
How long do I have time to get it or decide to send it back?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I liked.
She has been a vegetarian for a while, and nowadays she seldom eats meat.
I was also a vegetarian a few years ago.
To the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism has been a planned intermediate step, I have answered honestly without much thought.
And even though I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, at some point I reflected and understood that I would eventually support animal cruelty as well.
This is my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that her side was mischief, she then defended vegetarianism and meant she knew where her meat came from and how to reduce animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer was “plump”?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that, as a vegan, you get stuck in a corner quickly and conflicts arise without putting it on.
It welcomes a harmonious vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under <0xC2><0xA7> 312d BGB.
Do not detach your <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> from the legal requirements for remote sales.
I am on the assigned date when <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> does not collect my returns locally.
Since I can’t be there because of a funeral, unfortunately that can’t be changed.
Can an alternative pick-up date be assigned to me?
From 01.02.<0x23>NUMBER<0x23> I will meet again and again.
Lahnsteiner Water Rescue Reserve equipped: 45,000 euros grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Pfalz Interior Minister Roger Lewentz handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the Volunteer Feuerwehr Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte at Lahnstein City Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am glad that the Rhineland-Palatinate country is supporting us in this,” said Lahnstein’s Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment cart is used by the diving squad Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as in technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected that the boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the further use of the Lahn as a leisure stream, will contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read at 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, following their recommendations has been synchronized, removed and the app reloaded NOTHING has worked.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole action has taken me a long time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's right.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> for June.

First of all thank you for putting the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar activity, I mean we were also arms carriers in the executive, further I don’t want to say that!
I always find the question of the right and the left very simplified.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the state servant comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, which should actually be clear to everyone.
That of course, even in the particular uniform and weapon holders, people must also be drawn to the right of conservative magic, it should also be clear to everyone that these people can then naturally be able to deal with the living reality, it is also clear, of course, because of course, you have a little to see, in addition to the average white, in the meantime, I can't see many Germans, it's in the migration background, with the women and even the gays.
But even if for the first time it sounds funny to my experience from a conservative standpoint, they are proud of Germany and feel less distracted by excessive left-wing politics, even if this policy is supposed to be used for them or thinks it will just be normal for them, but they just want to deal with it.
Back to the right, because of course, the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right there, but these can openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that even policemen and soldiers who were often deployed abroad often start pausing because of negative experiences, and sometimes things say that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that there are certain times that right fellows of the mind meet who conduct a rainy exchange of thoughts.
However, in my opinion, this is well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment as a whole!
Germany is so internationally engaged and that is also so good in my opinion that we could not afford to have the right racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German page.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it was not sold out.
I ordered it in November.
This was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with <0x23>NAME<0x23> before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> basket for <0x23>NUMBER<0x23> Euro in Black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but on the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep cherubim, which were filled with something yellow

Ordinary by child?
Hello, I've been working on one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, very little leisure time), but for the rest of my life I get it more bad than just going to my household permanently clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which everything stays, and then and when it packs me and me up and clean up.
But it’s never really “that someone might come to visit spontaneously.”
My husband is (lamentably) not better either, although it bothers me somewhere but mostly loses household simply against work and discomfort.
The kitchen is cleaned even more regularly since we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with a child?
We have not yet worked on it and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn’t bother me as much as a doll, as long as there is no visit and e.g. there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a bigger motivation with a child or do you stay sluggish?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new and high-quality, as well as anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the Flex System 2 has more than doubled the area covered by the Flex System to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels on the joints reduce friction (shafts, arm and knee bends)
High-quality preforms in the lower back area and in the step ensure an engaging, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the lumbar spine area increases the flexibility of the back zipper and thus improves the comfort, especially when bending and mounting and placing equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and on the back guarantees increased flexibility in the movement of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a heating, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing on the face on the cap increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate head cap)
Soft, in the collar zone improves sealing with a finely adjustable width adjustment through a flexible, neat zipper that does not adhere to the casing or seams
Double cuffs with zipper on arm and foot joints connect an interlockable inner cuff with a soft, cascaded neoprene outer cuff
45<0xC2><0xB0> stitching at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and load-bearing.
Long zipper on the neck with an elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without a cap
Long G-Lock P backrest closure (anywhere without a cap) with metal slider and incorporated water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)

Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent a crack if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels bonded with external and internal overlapping
Edges of the outer sleeves stitched for greater load-bearing
Edges of inner sleeves embroidered for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially at deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with an uncertain personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I increasingly notice that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering restarting and studying social work for a long time.
The problem is that I have a self-confident (or fear-avoiding) personality disorder.
That means, roughly speaking, I don’t have a sense of self-esteem and therefore I’m shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have smooth conversations and I have been told often that I am acting immeasurably (which I believe has already improved).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family help.
But I don’t know if the actual working day is really the way I imagine it, and it’s hard to find something on the internet.
The <0xC3><0x84>VPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code (“once again the simplest things crawled”) and I find it hard to ask more experienced colleagues”I think you need to ask me “how” I should go with it (“I should go with the same thing in the meantime).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to mention it in the place.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for a pickup date
What do you mean by giving back?
If I have downloaded a book on the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>, the message your <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in a chat with <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>, who asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed by the feed breaks down the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein build-ups (amino acids) and builds up its own body proteins, which it also needs for the formation of feathers.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the regeneration of feathers in the mammalian bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the whole organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the crude course.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily use of NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g of NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended only to prepare as much drinking water/soft feed as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A drawn measuring spoon (injected) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe spring damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of spring re-formation is visible.
After that, the normal dose is reached until the spring regeneration is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15<0xC2><0xB0> and 25<0xC2><0xB0>C.
Excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Statement by a municipal staff member in opposition to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be found on our property.
So a case was filed with the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and therefore also the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, in the statute, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a protective tree.
Can I now rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your reply.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have an unused sofa.
Can you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that, the only question is whether I can pay in euro and let myself deliver the ceiling to Germany
Can you check this out?
Emergency notification: Severe traffic accident at Selb

As the police’s press alert said at 14:03 a.m., a car arrived in the opposite traffic.
There are wounded.
Ah, all right, understand.
Well, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further careers
First time Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is just thinking about everything you can think about.
Before I go out here .. briefly: I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation - i.e. from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross-country climber.
Originally I studied something else and also worked in a field there (at least to remain a little anonymous, I don’t mention anything more specifically here).
But then it was all too boring for me and I looked at alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I landed at the faculty and I was sure that it was - although the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but that didn’t matter to me.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job offers".
And it's only been six months.
In the paintings before that, I have always decided to move on and at least finish the ref, after which I can still turn around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
It’s a holiday, but there’s still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I would be stress resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday evening was my holiday evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn’t matter at the moment.
The family celebration is too stressful for me now.
And then there are these rigid structures that also irritate me.
Basically it is fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I’m completely exhausted and wondering how much stress my body can withstand before it completely closes—if it’s not doing it right now.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of my working life like this - just as I read some of your posts here - or if I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, I could not take my free time as I needed it now, but the work together was something that was boring and I found it to be the time.
But then I wonder if in a year I have not come back to the same place as I am now and I am dissatisfied.
You see, it’s all kind of awkward, but maybe you, as outsiders of advice or ideas, have gotten out of this situation, which I’m completely finished, and almost with the slightest thought of, started to cry.
I’m not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel – or to enjoy Christmas, that’s enough for me first.
Thank you for reading and apologise for the bitter undertone from me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has been constantly evolving, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reshape the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up to date in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers await with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only sprout.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts at the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since, to meet newly added sound requirements, which again led to a power boost in the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 – with more dynamics as well as numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20<0x2B> to the VT120<0x2B> with two speakers, the new VT<0x2B> Valvetronix series has also been designed to accommodate all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced playback of play dynamics and string hits, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this invention.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT<0x2B> amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic loses to Clippers
The Orlando Magic series of defeats in the NBA stops.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counts by his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104:106.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individual placement and foldable zipper dividers, it is adapted to suit the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-size flex cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible addition would be a DSLR camera with a lens set, two to three alternating lens and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various Sony-a7 series models or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for other lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (Olympus MFT cameras, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for its equipment and for photoshoots.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption in La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the start of the outbreak, lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused considerable damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
The Tehuya volcano erupted in 1585, with 84 days, as the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
Although the activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has declined slightly in recent days, volcanologists have no longer dared to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, told state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in the amount of millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1,000-degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick laundry layer.
That’s equivalent to almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, two new landings with a total size of about 50 hectares were created by cold lava.
Banana cultivation, which is particularly important for the island, has been severely affected, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely damaged, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children will not be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the flickering tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that our increasingly divided society still holds together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of the gift, so that the gesture of the gift, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mouss, has been a peace-building "society contract of natural peoples", can be re-established with this rigid routine and unwashed.
How Nicholas became the Christian child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with the gift.
Previously, gifts were given in one way or another at Nikolaustag.
The background of these still popular sits today is that St. Nicholas as Bishop of Myra secretly threw three women gold in her window in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional type of gift emerged the popular custom in Germany to fill the boots especially for children with gifts.
Protestants faced this practice because they rejected mediators between God and man as a "holy veneration".
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made Nicolaus the Christkind and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift thus shifts to Christmas Eve.
But since most Protestants no longer see such details so closely, it only annoys the less that the practice of St. Nicholas is similar to the use of Martins with Martinssingen and Martinsingen is still a solid part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, in boots at the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to desired luxury watches, you can find everything the heart desires.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources show a tradition of gifting since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian-style countries, there is a joyful cradle of wondering who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region, whether the Christian child appears on the Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, which is in principle a kind of Nicholas, to which some species have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white smoke bar, which has little in common with the rather stringent acid bar of the historical figure, his slit drawn by renters, and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at the Christmas party.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is supposed to have shown them the way to the Jesus Child.
In Scandinavia, fabulous creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some glory.
There are not rentiers here, but three horses pulling his sleds as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London on Saturday, an armed man was shot by police.
Police said callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials shortly afterwards.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the crime scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative lamp harmoniously fits into any beet, garden area or stone types.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored with 2 ground spikes in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lighting duration max. 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic design can be used all year round in the outdoors.
In the Hollywood spectacle, there are mostly endangered objects from distant galaxies that glow inwardly colorful.
On the other hand, “Smart Stone” is harmless: the sun alone ensures that this sunlight radiates fascinatingly – optionally in white or coloured light (in equal six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is consciously chosen: like a naturally shaped large silk, this modern lighting object presents itself on a daily basis.
Its organic roundings fit in any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the quarry.
He also makes himself good in the neighborhood of larger silk and findlings, where he knows how to claim himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of work: As a solar lamp, “Smart Stone” requires neither supply nor batteries.
Place the “lightstone” in any place that is detached from the sun.
Two provided ground sockets provide firm hold if needed.
The matt-white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides “Smart Stone” discreetly inside, along with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colorful light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
In the case of brewing, "Smart Stone" starts to light independently; in which color, you decide for yourself: equal to six attractive light colors are available to you – besides daylight white – to choose from.
Finally, switching off is automatically done as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it turns bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the front.
I’ve done this several times, it doesn’t work.
Sorry, I would have liked to have ordered with you, but if the voucher is not charged to me, then I will not order again by principle.
If you think otherwise, please let me know.
Otherwise, it was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.

The engine control of the LokSound 5 has again been fundamentally improved.
A variablely adjustable PWM torque frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super-smooth operation right in the case of bell antenna engines – the typical “boom” is part of the past.
The load control can now be adjusted with up to 10 CVs even in difficult cases.
The unique "Autotune" function allows the decoder to be automatically measured to the engine.
The LokSound 5 decoder delivers enough juice with up to 1.5A motor current even for older engines.

Pill problem
Hello, my dear lady,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
About my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, notably because I had such incredibly severe pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I’d like to leave that to happen again, because I already have to take enough medications that I can’t choose from because of chronic illnesses.
My main problem, surprisingly, is not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten from 0 to 100 explosive-like pickles on my last about two-year break and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it has loaded me pretty well and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time around.
My cosmetics are perfume-free and without blemishes, but maybe there’s something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the female doctor hasn't taken me so seriously and the dermatologist's appointment is still coming.
Thank you to everyone who reads the novel!
Lovely skin is no such thing.
Had pre-buperary severe neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale nodule spots and the acne theme.
I have also tried everything possible during the course of ch. disease and have stayed on low sugar, milk and meat-deficient mix food because nothing else has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormones are just the worm inside, but if you like I have everywhere you want to stop also don't go looking for something else still going wrong.
I already had all of her colleagues semina o.k.
I wrote and now I lost the conversation and I don’t know what was answered to my concerns.
I always have to work through and on the phone and all of a sudden everything was gone...
what is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong

110kV Earth Cable to be Rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The government of Lower Bavaria’s plan-making decision opens the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The seven-kilometre-long earth cable will connect the Tann circuit in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable will be connected near the village of Edermanning bei Reut to a mast of the free cable.

Ref: Teaching Planning (EK)
Hello, dear colleagues,
I’ve been in the ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I still have big problems planning my course in geology time efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy s/w for free (which is nerve-wracking for geology).
I just need a lot of time to plan my time.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors, and with me, every hour is actually a matter of its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don’t want to spend too much time on simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I actually always start with the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build it (most of the time I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn’t have).
We have the book Terra and with most assignments in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
And so are the worksheets.
Maybe a geographer can tell me how to work time efficiently with the book.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> from the <0x23>NUMBER<0x23> order.
I’ve actually decided on a new one at <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> but I’d like to finish the returns as soon as possible.
The trade fears Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or cured are allowed.
Trade considers this to be unnecessary and regrettable revenue breaks.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations undermine the important Christmas business from the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE) for retail trade.
In the case of businesses with items of non-daily need, revenue breaks should be complained, criticised HDE CEO Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively on the remaining days of the year.
A lot of people would have written off the Christmas business.
“What really should be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without ground,” Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis revenues over the past week.
It works well only in the grocery store as well as in the online area.
The association demanded consequences from dramatic developments.
Purchasing with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe thing, the CEO said.
“2G does not move us further in the fight against the pandemic,” he said.
The current regulations frightened customers and required high staffing.
The gang regulation must be approved throughout the state, he demanded.
After that, each customer had to be checked only once on 2G (vaccinated or cured) and had access to all stores with the band received on that day.
In addition, sampling controls should be sufficient in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested).
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping malls, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of pre-corona levels, with sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of such an important Christmas business,” said Wilhelm Wellner, CEO of the “Economic Week”.
Due to the high staff and administrative effort, the Center will try to find and get approved solutions.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "for example, visitors can once at a central location in the center provide their 2G proof and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - enter all shops without disturbance". dpa
I recently ordered the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> and received it.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been tried to be cashed with a yellow filler.
That looks awkward.
I would like to return the mirror and have already wrapped it back in the package and glued it.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp generates a very light current with soft light of high quality, completely flash-free.
The 120-degree radiation angle, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small spaces or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the movie set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller enables remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display displays the current brightness setting as a percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, simply press one of the memory keys and press one of the memory keys.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that when switching on again, the known situation is restored - very convenient when working in the studio when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the ability to operate with affordable NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera changers (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power – it’s a battery tester equal to the built-in – for each of the two battery cases a value in the two displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply power to the headlamp via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for attachment, so you can directly to your photo stand.
The inclination must be adjusted reliably on both sides by means of fixers.
It has been observed that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the delivery.
It is great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may still want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got the gift and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after heavy comeback against leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction of Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two in a series of unsuccessful Hessen were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga plethora.
But then the SGE turned up, and within a good hour, the frustration over a mature season start from the soul and defeated furios with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys have done today," said coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN, and said, "There was a pausal of every lob.
At first, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters, who are still at rank nine behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the liver cushions by 2-0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE-trainer.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his defeated muscle injury, also stressed the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but also looks good in terms of the staff situation.
It is exceptional that we have all the players fit in December that all the players are physically in a top constitution.
It’s top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now we want to "follow step by step and remain humble" and the tasks to be carried out until the year change "at this level".
Next Wednesday, in the course of the English week, an outside game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 pm, Sky) will be on the program.
Grade I get the mail my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is returned and the order is returned?
Unfortunately for me it would be called that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> chairs?
Women's handball cushion before quarter-finals against Spain
Germany’s handball women sneeze after humiliation against Denmark with their heads hanging and empty eyes from the parquet floor.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection in 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers made a heavy loss and now has to run against host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we weren't able to take the flow.
It was a bad game from everyone that we have to delete," Captain Emily Bölk said.
In the fight to enter the semi-finals against the 2019 World Cup second on Tuesday, a significant increase must be made in order to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German pitcher in the duel with the three-time Olympic winner Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in the attack nor in the defense," backroom player Xenia Smits admitted, demanding: "We have to look forward quickly now."
From the front to the rear not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team with the Anpfiff was not at the top.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and defensive gaps were responsible for a quick 0:4 draw after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some parades worse.
The first goal reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-office.
However, this was not the initial inflammation expected.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly stand in the scene - and yet, they failed mostly at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game ran early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially backroom player Mia Zschocke a little later because of a hard foul to her opponent also saw red.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a bit better into the game and until the break at least five goals.
The only quiet hope for a chase after the change was already there after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Groener defenders sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-established opponent, who is among the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to rise to an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the parkett.

As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have celebrated the Nicholas Day and take it as an occasion to dedicate family traditions in the pre-Christmas season, the Advent, Nicholas, Christmas Eve and the Christmas holidays.
How was that at the time at your house?
How about your partner? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Do you want to share your traditions with your children?
What is the most beautiful for the children?
The boot cushion?
Place baking?
Tree jewelry?
Is it music?
Is the Santa Claus coming, the Christian child, or is it the gift of Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone gives up and around Christmas effort to have it as beautiful as possible as a family.
Whether these are solid traditions, or even something different every year: tell us how it’s going on or going on in your family!
Please send me some transaction number.. or anything else that might help.

Is this going on with them?
The title suggests that I am an importing doctor in mobile vaccination teams where (until now only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated v.a. in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be completed for a large part, then they continue to be partly in vaccination centers for me.
I like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, unless these are related to one in person (e.g. "I take medication X, this is tolerated with vaccination.").
In my field of work, the information on vaccination, the indication position (person is entitled to vaccination by Coronavirus Prevention and there is no reason to disagree), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (we have never happened).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often have no, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutic-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but who can't carry out vaccinations (leave?), so I also carry out most vaccinations there myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "skinner"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, BR-TV broadcast "We in Bavaria" has been provided for vigorous reflection.
But unlike many of the previous days, the term in the series "Host me?" remained unclear this time by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one, “that has to go fast.”
That, people heard from the TV moderator, is completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg communicated the solution, and with that he probably surprised many top counterfeiters.
"The skinner," the spectators learned, "is a sheet with which someone wipes the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bayern Television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical upperfalse term, it is somehow derived from the more well-known oral word "Houdern".
With which an educational gap was closed - probably also in several who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven’t bought books in two weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> gel, connected, synchronized and repaired with the PC.
Nothing's helped.
Tire selection in racing bikes- really so pantanic?
This morning I woke up with a lot of action because I wanted to work out at least a little more to prepare for my bike tour next week.
That said, done and I drove off with my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every city centre (this time: Thanks Krefeld!)
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, the zipper and my rear tyre didn’t want to take the rest of the track at all.
Since I had no real chance of getting a replacement coat and spare hose because of the weekday, I had to turn back half badly and take the first train home.
It wasn’t that bad, maybe it’s even better if I practice it with the tire change before the bike tour.
But now I have a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days ahead of me, I would get extremely rough of this problem more often.
Now it wasn't really bad, because even the old tyres from the previous owner (very nice old man, the day I came to pick up the bike was 120km!) and who had already called these as suboptimal, because he had been riding with them for several years.
But if I think I still have to change the tyre when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I’m really badly lazy :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man on the train ladder, who wondered why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tyres; they should be insupportable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very appealing.
But are these really so infallible?
I have little desire to spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>40/tyre now just to be disappointed.
I'm also wondering: I currently have 25x622 on the racing wheel.
They are also available (apparently?) at the Marathon Plus tires, but most are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on a race bike in general to other tyres?
The Schwalbe page seems to be my absolute! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for your help and dear greetings!

After the release of our new high end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would grow again.
SOLO 15 is called the new Sprössling and recalls visually the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes an appropriately designed foot directly included to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
It has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people whose maximum volume plays a more subordinate role, but is intended to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to generate such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears noticeably grown and for its size extremely impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was tuned to tonal with a slight high-tone rise.
This is generally common in broadband to optimize the highly increasing bundling at high frequencies.
Exactly oriented to the listening area, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Easily rotated outwards, the high-tone area can be reduced and thus the sound image can be warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a music piece in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and astonishingly accurate.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that looks the same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction kits, it is recommended to start thinking about the final optics of the speaker, in order to plan with the corresponding changes in construction.
For example, if you want to furnish the housing, the reduction of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the furnishing again loads material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floor plate at the appropriate place in order to be able to carry the cable smoothly thereafter.
With the help of an upper milling, the speaker opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used in a later manner.
At the rear, this opening should be provided with a 45<0xC2><0xB0> phase in order to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screw points of the B 100-6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now mounted on these.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in material thickness if needed, if you want to use finished bars from the construction market, for example, instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next work step, the second side will be attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. both sides, as well as the front.
The openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall, are facilitated by means of a suitable hole-circuit saw or drilling drill.
Then a round milling machine is used to round all edges of the actual box.
The top of the foot plate can also be rounded with this.
Subsequently, the foot plate is firmly glued with the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and pre drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screwing points of the speaker chassis and the connecting terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blow out), you start with the laying of the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot to the terminal opening and let it out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is guided to the speaker opening and also lets it loosely hang out there.
Subsequently, the frequency ranges are prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency ranges, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be obtained from the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency range is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is followed, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening and thus close.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
Now follow the mitigation according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100-6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered on the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and deliver it in early June?
"Hello to all of you,
> finally we can announce that we will be hosting OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per switch, so we will be following the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in streaming and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we’ll do everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will leave at about 0:30.
Imagine cold drinks, plant good food and prepare yourself for a long but very interesting night.
