USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic community to work to create a safe environment for all its athletes.
We agree with what the USOC says, that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can be better served by bringing about a significant change within our organization, rather than by decertification.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the femur of this animal was brown in the upper part, with a pale coloration or carotenoid in the lower part.
The discovery also allows for detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur plumage is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called shrimp, but instead has other characteristics typical of feathers, beards and beards, the researchers concluded that the shrimp is likely the result of an evolutionary development following such characteristics.
The structure of the feather makes it think that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for courting. Researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult feather and not the chick feather.
According to the researchers’ assumptions, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult feather and not that of a chick.

The activity carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the Sagittarius galaxy's reliefs.
The effect sought by the team was to be provoked by the tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on Earth that generates tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to summarize that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halon, formed by a multitude of small particles.

Candidates can send their representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers perform the computation of votes under strict supervision, in accordance with the specific procedures.

Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear at the Westminster Magistrates’ Court on February 16.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden, and 21-year-old driver Zachary Cuddeback.
Edgar Veguilla reported injuries to the arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blind from an eye, he lacks a skull section and his face has been rebuilt in titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconferencing from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to the Wednesday event, the Carpanedo participated in two single championship races.
The first in the slalom, where at the first descent a DNT was recorded. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not complete the test.
The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, saw her ranked tenth in the women's group category "sitting", with a combined rowing time of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower than 1:09.02 Danunghere.
Four women's team skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Gigante Slalom did not qualify in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police were able to retrieve the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
The Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman, and we have also found her cell phone and her laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their face covered.
None of the three people who were at home at the time of the car crash were injured.
However, the driver was severely injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the ambulance services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh's Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his own son.
She is detained pending trial and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be contaminated, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice has other parameters, and the Scottish courts have found the publication of the photographs potentially damaging.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, “journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects walk on mined land.”
The Crown Office, which has the general responsibility for judicial proceedings, has clarified reporters that no further comments will be released at least until the formal indictment.
According to the report, the document will be the subject of the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon that presence for only five years.
The shooters within the experimental program for the control of harmful animals had to be closely monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its efficacy was assessed.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly’s fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month a presidential committee proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignations of the previous CEP.
The committee constituted Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, which challenged the regime.
Occasionally violent protests have been triggered by the lack of elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, which caused a total of six fires and caused slight burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Industry (METI) announced that it was informed by Apple of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
In its response, the ministry described Apple’s report as “absolutely deprecatable.”
The Marianne earthquake was alerted at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office no damage was reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took hostage from Hong Kong tourists after kidnapping their bus.
With his M16 rifle Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists.
Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was hit to death.
Liggins tracked down his father's footsteps and began his career as a doctor.
After completing her training in obstetrics, she joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving in the hospital, Liggins began to study cases of premature labor in his spare time.
Her research has shown that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two ‘black boxes’ with flight records.
His wrestling companions also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "The Moon was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died in the night of the two moons. Unique, just like you. A strong woman."
"The moon was as strange as me... Maybe even more... I love it and will miss it... Hopefully it's in a better place," Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented.
According to a survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia’s transition to a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal election, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of the survey participants, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
Contrary to the survey, 29% of respondents argue that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% are of the opinion that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal should have competed in the freestyle 100 and 200 metres and in three raffles at the Commonwealth Games, but it has accused several disorders that have led to doubts about its physical fitness.
He could not take the medications necessary to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, i.e. matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists wish to understand how planets form and in particular how Earth formed, having encountered comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law that legalizes same-sex marriage.
According to him, speculations are nothing but “chatchers and political idiots.”
A candidacy for the presidency is expected in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel a year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology rather than the outdated ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no additional transportation and surface trains will not stop in Wembley, while there are no parking for cars or exchange parking on site.
Concerns about the absence of the means of transport have made it possible to have the game necessarily played at closed doors, without the support of the team’s fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of birds would have been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from the University of Princeton, United States, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time needed for this process was much longer; this is due to the coupling between an endemic fringe of Darwin, Geospiza fortees, and Geospiza fortees.
Gold can be worked in any kind of shape. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin yarn, suitable to be twisted and knitted. It can be hammered or rolled in sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "miniature codes" precisely thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice it is possible to build a pH indicator.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical analyzed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are the protons from which the electrons have been torn apart (because the hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, pour them into a ball.
Between the moisture present on your hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water equipped with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, residues of sewage networks were discovered.
Cabinets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes inserted in public baths, attended by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was done with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and visual.
To carry a satellite or telescope into space, it takes a rocket that is more than 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is to have provided us with simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antilopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free domestic cats) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social feline and live in numerous groups called branches.
Branches are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lions’ flock acts in a very similar way to the wolf or dog flock, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of the lions (but not that of other large felines), even in terms of the deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (though not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exercise a tensile force five times higher than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones to rust.
The roar of a tiger is not as powerful as that of a lion, but more like a phrase of screaming and angry words.
Ocelots like to feed on small animals. If possible, they go hunting for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all prey they catch are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (predators) thanks to the odor, whipping to the ground where they were.
Thanks to the night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelots mimic themselves with the surrounding environment and then lead them on.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or moves on a new island, thus making it difficult for an eventual return), it will likely find itself in an environment different from that in which it was before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so to stand as a strong competitor, the new population will need characteristics or transformations different from those previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adjustments as before.
As time goes on and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb carbon dioxide expelled from them (through exhalation).
Plants process their own nutrients with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our homes from plants and produce clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosaur was the superpredator of his era, and therefore he feared nothing but the other mosaurs.
From its long scissors were more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, plus an additional row located on the palate, so there was no escape for anyone who crossed his path.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that he had his tongue bifurcated. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosaari and it is also possible that he was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would appear familiar to us, the Roman banquets also provided various strange or unusual fruits, such as the cinnamon, the pawn, the slugs, and a kind of rodent called ghiro.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to feast together lying on a side while eating their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods, which arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a doughnut.
The Babylonians built for each deity a main temple, which was considered the home of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests sought to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an internal shrine accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurat, were built, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family’s life was outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple open-air benches overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was scarcely populated, and the northern sagas tell us that it was Erik the Red who gave him his name, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of his discovery, at that time the Echimese tribes already lived there.
Although all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you’ve seen the movie “The Mystery of the Templars,” you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence a treasure map is drawn.
However, this is false. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears head-to-head at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measure 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rounded to be laid back.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was only assigned as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent clashes had led the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive took the name of "Operation Dragoon".
The American and Liberal French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading for Germany.
Civilization means a specific culture, shared by a significantly broad group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term in turn is connected with "civis", i.e. citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city or city-state, and in a certain way also defines the dimensions of society.
Cities-state are the first realities to anticipate the idea of a nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural footprint through an equitable dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, not being so recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was the only component, according to the Constitution of the Confederacy.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of executive or judicial power at the national level, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, for the implementation of its acts.
He also did not have the authority to bypass tax laws and taxes between states.
In order to change the articles, the unanimous consent of all states was required, and they had so little consideration from the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful football team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, scuba diving, screening, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more common in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in competitions in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of the Japanese almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, it refers to Japan as an archipelago, considered the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who transited from there slowly recorded the island's name with the name Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East Indies Company in 1624 established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation involving Aboriginal cereal production systems and hiring Chinese farmers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan ended up under control of the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895 ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, and notably the Intihuatana, The Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu’s site had been recovered, but restoration works are still underway.
The most common format in the world for fixed image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most used film on the end of the analog photography era.
It is still produced today and, most importantly, its appearance ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The both exploited and often derisa rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was entitled to be under review.
Christianity had acted as an adhesive between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and customary differences.
His omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s monetary reserves exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the discontinuation of any essential military and civilian supply, despite this blockade violating international law usually accepted and encoded by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from accessing entire sections of the ocean, also putting neutral ships at risk.
As this tactic sparked a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate underwater war campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City, which led him to move to the United States.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most famous was the so-called period of the Three Kingdoms, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars broke out among many nobles in the struggle for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the most violent periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for a place of honor in Xi'an's imposing palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
In addition, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since the military classifications, instead of being class-based, are now based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived over time, offers itself a very clear picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave rests on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not at all easy to find, even though he knew its existence. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From inside the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that arrives today not in ruins.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, houses numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, various temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of the pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs and minor temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and relatives.
The "arc up" indication resembles a V and the "arc down" indication resembles a graffiti or a square without the bottom side.
Upward means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downward means that you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards itself.
An ascending arch usually produces a softer sound, while a descending arch produces a louder and more decisive sound.
You can choose to add your personalized pencil indications, but keep in mind that the archery signs you find printed have a musical value, so in the end they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, prey to terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Maria Antonietta, their two young children (Maria Teresa 11 years old and Luigi Carlo 4 years old) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to keep the windows of their carriage open.
At one point, someone among the crowd showed the terrorized queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains resulting from the exploitation of the Filipino people during the time constituted the profits at the base of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the XI, XII and XIII centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Full Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which concludes by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense that man's destiny is moved by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with the ownership of a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new relief techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, treated by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time have emerged customs, customs and culture related to such geography that, being in harmony with the context of society, are more effective results than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similar to Paris, now known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a neuralgic center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century his prestige declined, especially because the crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was touched in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
But the slow pace of communication means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, as a result of the crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced for the sole purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his/her family.
subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in combination with rotation of crops or other relatively simple techniques aimed at obtaining the maximum from harvests.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still the case.
Subcultures share individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel representatives of the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and argot.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, by negligence, as a result of misfortunes, or as a result of intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "ferrals" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the animal child is fully bred by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within the physical limits) almost completely similar to those of the particular animal that has taken care of him, such as fear or indifference to man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mode, as much as a help for those embarking on a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but it is also the small graffiti assistant of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, demand and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are given in trust for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not provide them with nutrition, care and training, but it happens to them.
We believe that the trust represents a safe area for these children.
Our trust system should provide safe homes, loving trusting parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The trust is supposed to meet all unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet itself brings together some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage theory and gratifications.
For example, as important reasons for the use of the Internet are suggested "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people who are unable to understand the language spoken due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess honesty.
He even argues that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as pet dogs.
In the 20th century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is removed from the expressed variability pool.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability forward and backward between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet their own need for amino acids with the plant resources available in the savanna.
In addition, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowdown in growth, malnutrition and, in the end, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should not be surprising that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way that the chimpanzees of the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a recovery of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice using a relatively silent awakening to lead you to a state of consciousness, without waking up completely.
If you decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options include the consumption of many fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionately opposite to the tension that exists in his body and in his spirit.
The smaller the tension, the more positive the existing vital force. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This objective is only hampered by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana Rite and various techniques of Indian yoga.
Ultimately, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has a foundation in Kundalini Yoga, in meditation and in a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of lighting) by using yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantra and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the heart of Tibetan meditation. By depicting various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, system, procedural and cultural conflicts, caused the breakup between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies; so the Cold War began.
It would have lasted for the next 40 years and it would have been really fought, by mercenary armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already been dismantled; the only option was to beat in retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge head.
These plans proved, however, immediately obsolete, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the peace treaty of Riga, the multilateral Soviet-Polish international non-aggression pact and other treaties.
Exploiting ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navy has always been to ensure that the country is safeguarded by its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the same ability of the enemies to move their people and goods.
One recent example in support of this theory and most notable is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago on the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
They began to be raised by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to easily have milk, fur, meat and leather at their disposal.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds that were free to move on the hills or in other pasture areas, often cared for by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of shepherding are still used today.
In the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although they were simply made of parallel wooden axes, the wagonways, compared to the slightly steeper roads of the period, allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossings were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in position. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar at the top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels left the place for those in iron. In 1767 they made their appearance the first wheels completely in iron.
The first means of transport known to man were the legs. Humans began to walk in erect position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "erect man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Specialization marks for the bipedal path are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmentalist movement and also activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we don’t want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and turn it off.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while problems have increased due to the overcrowding and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's typography a few blocks away.
In the evening, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, today known as "The Dunlap Manifestos".
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the court of the Independence Hall and the assignment was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which made it read to his room troops in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 embroideries of Dunlap still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today, a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend to not consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that share them with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with feet with squamous and claws, lay eggs and walk on the two rear legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently used.
A binary number can have only one of the two values, namely 0 or 1, and in the technical language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning may be the presence in the home of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
Check that there are first-aid instructions on the label for that specific poison.
The term acaro is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become human parasites.
Both the killer puppies and the bed puppies are cute, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or in their guest house.
In the United States, multiple sclerosis (MS) has about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young and middle-aged adults.
SM is a disease that affects the central nervous system, of which the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve are part.
Research has shown that the likelihood of developing MS among women is twice as high as that of men.
A couple can decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or in your child’s interest.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific research.
But it’s not just experimentation, because an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses; also asking questions and making observations can guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle’s views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the gradual decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its philosophical and scientific roots.
In many, they have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior are decisively dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, relative to much of the living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological watches are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They conducted two experiments highlighting the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells belong to the germ line.
Mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism invites people interested in visiting the natural areas with the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small countryside to get to work by car, crossing other people whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic andirivini, everyone is somehow connected to a private car-based transport system, which at the same time supports.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution in the last two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, of which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges that fall into ruin.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are engineers designing them that are incompetent, or are there deeper motives?
Traffic Flow (traffic flow) is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex as the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to fall back into a reasonably constant range, so traffic flows in turn tend to show a reasonable consistency and can be represented genericly mathematically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) range, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to take advantage of a greater variety of small whales to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist today, the only ones who are unable to fold their wings are the libellules and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some were right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and other stars), was moving around the Earth.
Which seems to make sense, because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river in the world. It transports an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that reaches six miles at some points.
20% of the total water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main river Rio delle Amazoni is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, where the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries flow.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of greatness and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained charming admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City consists of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and that with the smallest population.
The language of the Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the daily use language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in their native form and it is possible to extract them quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These in fact resemble more the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they would transform into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could get to the point at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil turned out to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and to an increasingly less widespread use.
Today, everyone writes messages on computer screens and never has the need to approach a temperament.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something newer arrives.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis for the operation of the fission pump.
In practice, it's like rolling a heavy trolley on a hill. So, further dividing the core, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break in the presence of a weak thrust or nothing.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called a crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The marias could be more numerous on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the rise of the lava to the surface.
Content theories are focused on the search for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people have in common and drive them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that drive them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most common content theories are Maslow’s Hierarchy of Necessities and Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start directing their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or of the girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibility.
On the other hand, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the entire team’s work and do it himself.
Ultimately, the leader is the person who ultimately is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often have the contact point function for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place depending on the different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
An "invisible team" is the management team to which each member refers and is the one that sets standards for each member.
Why should an organization be willing to face the long process leading to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason to implement the concepts of organizational learning can be innovation.
When you manage to use all the resources available efficiently in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
In order for an organization to define itself as innovative, it is necessary for leaders to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
The neurobiological findings have shown the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes more narrow and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain disease and behavior is at the heart of scientists’ research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and cancers can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been observed before.
This gives us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite its strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with intelligent machine behavior, learning, and adaptation.
AI research includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application include checking, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and questions, as well as writing, vocal and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is often used today in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are a key part of teaching, and often teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see the artifacts of museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great prerequisite for sharing travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by poor grammar and spelling, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative opinions the blogger commits to improving writing.
The blogs also "bring students to become more aware of the moment around them". The need to feed the public interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
Correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the suggestive and bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the country’s past and present.
More to the south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and uncontaminated beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian in the opinion of foreigners.
Wide areas more north are scarcely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wild lands.
If you make a population comparison, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in itself.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxury resorts, are mostly independent or associated with France.
In the Arab lands also brought Islam, which embarked on a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the fifteenth century, the discovery of the Cape's route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For travellers: it is recommended that everyone declares to be married, regardless of the actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It is appropriate for women to realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider a harassment, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and be not afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenidians.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of the White House, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by Spanish merchants who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather items, narguile and a lot of cincaglieria, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city’s streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to document yourself well before making any visits outside of Goma, in order to assess the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing to the Nyiragongo volcano, in addition to being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (taxi-motorcycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short race.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctù" ended up becoming an exotic and distant land metaphor.
Today, Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the UNESCO list of sites that are at risk, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In PBS' Henry Louis Gates' special "Wonders of the African World" ("Wonders of the African World") was one of the main stages.
With its more Arabic touch than African, the city is clearly distinguished from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north border with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different eco-zones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most important of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily contributions for conservation and entrance to the park.
Buying a Wild Card can also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the whole territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a sparkling bar chart, even more evident because it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront in front.
Most of Hong Kong’s urban development has focused on the densely populated, north coastal bonified land.
This is the place that the British colonists chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of this land’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal range of mangroves in the world. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gange plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which are paludous areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; the area is estimated to have 400 royal tigers from Bengal and about 30,000 maculate deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and robust Japanese small buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby towns, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge on the Oyapock River is a dashed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
Its two tracks have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two tracks 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic occurred only in March 2017.
By September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be finalized, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that lived in present-day Eastern Paraguay. They were semi-monthly hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of India", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina has one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, in the Las Cañitas polo fields, the most important tournament of the year is held.
Here you can attend minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for pole matches, please contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their official currency, the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank of the islands, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers the currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley you can often also pay with credit cards and US dollars.
On the peripheral islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although UK and U.S. currencies may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so you exchange the money before you go back.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30<0xC2><0xB0>C are quite normal.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely reach below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rain" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of man, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may look: bisons, sharks, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping a proper distance. It is necessary to leave these animals a suitable space as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing food with you or cooking with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port there was a sadly known shipwreck of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the North Shore Pacific Ocean (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
It is mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of the pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches in Auckland Central, in the stylish suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitemata.
These are beaches suitable for families sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide selection of shops. You can bathe safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have many French wines, but those Australians and New Zealanders could better cope with the trip.
The tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, 'flat white' coffee is born from a foreign idea. Espresso' is short black coffee, cappuccino is covered with cloth (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the coral reef and accidents for one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow the instructions and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Cubomedusas appear from October to April near the beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period you can only find occasional.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack man. Most sharks fear him and tend to stay away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of river estuaries north of Rockhampton, not actively living them in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the serenity to find a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often make agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport/airport transfers or even combined flight<0x2B>hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to provide you with additional documents needed for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be made to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect as a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action, you need to arrive early and give yourself a space near the music.
Remember that once the music on the main stages is over, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes quite annoying noise for those who are most exposed to it.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include the time to spend exploring the city. Passengers of the cruises are exempted from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything to increase the time and money spent by their guests as much as possible. Generally, there are neither windows, nor watches, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the mood of the guests high to make sure they are entertained.
In some venues, alcoholic beverages are offered from the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters the ability to judge and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is reduced and you can’t drive like when you’re on a clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, in very little time it can fall so much snow that it will keep you stuck.
Even rainfall and snow rafting, or ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, can reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa’s biggest tourist attraction and the heart of many visitors’ holidays.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips made by land, especially in the savanna, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get a good visual.
Lions, guepards, and leopards are sometimes frightening and therefore it is possible to observe them better with the binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "excursion safari", or "walk safari") is a hike that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and part of the events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the two Summer Olympics, the first Olympics being held in 1964.
If your flight booking and accommodation for 2020 was made before the delay was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary from one another, however most cancellation policies related to the coronavirus, at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most tickets for events will be between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, while normal tickets will cost around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can make drying easier. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try a hairdryer, if you have it at your disposal.
Be careful not to expose the fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid restrictions or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, so in case of doubt, it is appropriate to evaluate the purchase of water packaged within sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers can come into contact with animal parasites that are not widespread in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmitting poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax-free and excise products in certain locations.
Travelers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one that has the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, it is recommended to keep your eyes open, as it predominates steep slopes, narrow roads and narrow curves.
The speed limits exposed are significantly lower than those applied in previous and subsequent stretches (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of the mobile phone service is much higher than that found in other parts of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria south.
Fruit cakes are an irreplaceable classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and prunes, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German bakery cakes also contain almonds, nuts and other shellfish fruits. The most popular cakes are often accompanied very well by a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to taste small but rich sweets, you can focus on those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
The curry may appear both "dry" and "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan for curries in the inland regions, yogurt is usually used; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating in the central and eastern area of the main island, Giava.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely distributed throughout the archipelago, offers a number of simple cooking dishes; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The supports are supports for the knight’s feet and are hung on both sides of the chair.
They guarantee greater stability to the knight, but they may present security problems for the possibility that the knight’s feet will remain blocked.
If a puppy is displaced by a horse but has a foot embedded in the rack, it may be dragged by the running horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heel and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially those in England, have inserted safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to break from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the knight pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs are trapped.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continuously trace new paths on its walls, potentially infinite.
Free-dip snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and provide for skiing on the snow thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts multiple enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums" (ski bums), which dedicate whole holiday periods to skiing activity in a particular area.
The basic principle of skiing is very ancient: the first cave paintings with the depiction of humans dating back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Ski hiking: the activity is also called cross-country skiing, mountaineering or ski trekking.
It is connected, although it usually does not understand them, to ski touring or skiing, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much harder skiing and shoes.
Think of the ski slope as a hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you can cover distances somewhat higher than those on walking trails, but very rarely you will reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy bag on steep slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through several countries would need to apply for a visa and pass for passport control multiple times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area works more like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to passport checks again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antiquity piece. Some tax agencies consider it an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition presents geographic differences with respect to the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America with respect to Europe.
Handicraft objects could be defined as pieces of antiquities, although more recent than similar items produced in series.
The breeding of reindeer is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding; some lived fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as working animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of the Sámi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roman people, the word "cigarette" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a traveler warning should be issued to the destination you are visiting, there may be consequences on your travel health insurance or your insurance in case of cancellation of the trip.
You may also be interested in opinions of governments other than yours, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The notices are simply a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social discomfort or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong windstorms, thunderstorms, precipitation above the norm and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to weather, tornadoes, marine thunderstorms and cyclones.
High-intensity regional and seasonal weather phenomena include storms, snow bubbles, ice storms and sand storms.
Travellers are advised to be informed about the adverse weather conditions that affect their area, as they may affect the planning of the trip.
Anyone who plans to visit a potentially significant country as a war zone must support professional training.
Searching on the Internet 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all issues here discussed in a much more detailed way, usually using practical experience.
A standard course lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers who are planning a surgical procedure to change sex abroad must make sure they have the documents valid for the return trip with them.
The government’s intention to issue passports without sex (X) indications or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
The availability of foreign governments to accept such documents is also variable.
Inspections at security checks also became much more scrupulous in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people in pre-operative phase should not expect to pass checks without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Rising currents are the return flow of waves that break off on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the submarine topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current toward the open sea can form.
Most deaths survive due to fatigue in an attempt to swim countercurrent, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, returning to swimming will not be more difficult than normal.
Try to identify an area where you are not at risk of being trapped again, or consider whether to wait for rescue, based on your skills and whether you have been spotted.
The return shock manifests itself in a shorter time than the cultural shock (being a smaller “honeymoon” phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to the culture of their country of origin.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will be adapted to the new culture and you will have lost some of the uses of your native culture.
In the first experience abroad, you are likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware of the fact that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness being needed even for those who return home.
The show of sounds and lights of the pyramid is how much more interesting there is in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, you will be able to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Usually you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a story book.
Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by several countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, sixteen of which are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the most extensive and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the boiler of a still active volcano filled with water from its source to a magnificent natural port.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula melt in the plateau, then reemerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km chain cut into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinelle Chain, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, because to call you have to be outdoors with the visibility bubble up to the satellite.
The service is often used by sports boats, including sports boats, as well as missions that need remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those who plan to take a Sabbath year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly common among neo-diplomats, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad in the Sabbath year can actually increase your chances of resuming higher education before returning to your home country.
Usually enrollment in these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of the Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, inside the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
There is no need for a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, the smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Nautical is the national hobby of Finland, where one boat is counted every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather unique fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two full days, returning on the ship in the evening to sleep.
For landing you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009) using the on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, and the visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by air can scare people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flew before or had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not different from the fears and personal aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people understanding a little how planes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on what is unknown, or on the fact that you don’t have control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some routes larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems arose.
On some routes, air shipments would have taken days to unload and customs.
The only way to get it faster would be to ship it as a luggage stack. And that is where you come into play, since airline regulations do not allow to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or in business class the most obvious way is to squander a nice figure for the privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do so).
However, the price to be paid is high: for example, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal low-cost fare for business trips and up to eleven times the fare for first class ones!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it is not even worth looking for discounts on first-class or business-class seats.
Airlines know well that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and conveniently to their destination, and therefore apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that in the past was the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and its own currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, the economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian-Orthodox religion.
Smyrna is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation cruise.
The ancient city of Smyrna grows on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and is now a modern, evolved and active shopping center.
Although in the city you can breathe an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide streets, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are bordered by the characteristic red tile roofs, the 18th-century market and mosques and anti-churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the shrine of the church, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons.
A half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north lies the romantic and charming city of Sintra, easily reachable. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant story of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The bus line Scotturb 403 regularly connects with Sintra, and stops in Cabo da Roca.
Always to the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of famous Marian apparitions all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a common pit, and has an almost incalculable meaning for an important part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who survived in these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or left to work until death, whether Jews or not.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid distorting these places by embracing structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known to virtually everyone.
However, most of the signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
In the metro, regular ads are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
The Parisians have a reputation for being selfish, scrupulous and presumptuous.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get well in Paris continues to be to behave at its best, communicating as a "bien élevé" (well educated) person. This will definitely facilitate your travels.
The rough appearance of the parishioners will quickly disappear if you take advantage of some good basic ways.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, predominantly with beech, fish and beetles, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels present a wide variety of plant communities.
The area also hosts a huge variety of animal and bird species.
In these places live rare species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and cedar cockroach, alongside several other species of animals most common.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide chairs for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nurse at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants under their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, a unique size for everyone!
Majorchina cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the spices available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "You" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "You", always begin with the mayonnaise, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and additions.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantive form makes writing rather complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple as most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: expensive means loved, while car means carriage.
The Persian has a relatively simple grammar and most of the time regular.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a minimal knowledge of the Spanish language can come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Today, pre-modern observers are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden age did not pose a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are huge structures in lost areas where weather conditions are favourable.
Admire the flowering of cherries, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept was originally from China, where prune flowering was preferred.
In Japan, the first festivals for the flowering of cherries were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other members of the aristocracy near the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "only" a specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you to get away from this place, without any discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy-to-turn city; you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to count on the warm (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is serene).
Some buses also head north, towards Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reach the inside of Hebron and do not stop near the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland water courses can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can do a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can navigate the Erie Canal.
They also define hiking trails and well-known cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivities of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Much of the traditions related to this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians from all over the world.
A tradition involves spending the Easter night awake in an outdoor place to admire the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations at the basis of this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual related to spring and fertility.
In the most traditional Churches, an Easter vigil is celebrated on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations that often start the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came to us for swimming, flying or floating.
Because the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals were unable to cope with the journey, which made the giant turtle the main pasture animal in the Galapagos.
In the Galapagos, numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced after the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, it will be possible to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility of witnessing the boreal dawn, because the sky remains dark almost all day long.
Since the territories are poorly populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the culture of work is more hierarchical and formal than the culture Westerners tend to be used to.
Office clothing is usually made up of jacket and tie or tailor and is addressed to colleagues with the surname or professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it gives importance to the group's commitment rather than commending individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the welfare of their superiors regarding each decision, and they are expected to follow the instructions without asking questions.
