One of the most well-known methods of dealing with others is to look at the bad example of many children who did not live with them when they were growing up in order to avoid being bullied, abused, or mistreated.
They called the children "feral" or forest children. Some of the forest children captured them with other people (mostly their parents); for example, they threw the child away because the parents found him to be incompetent or had severe changes in his body.
The children of the forest may have been severely rescued or in distress before they were abandoned or fled.
Some seem to have been rescued by animals; others are said to be living in their own forests.
