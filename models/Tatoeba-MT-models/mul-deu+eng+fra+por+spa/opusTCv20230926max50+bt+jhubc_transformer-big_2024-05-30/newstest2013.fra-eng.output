A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justify their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
The Brennan Centre considers it a myth, stating that election fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
In addition, Republican lawyers have identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in the last 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws from 2009 to make the process of enrollment or voting more difficult.
This phenomenon grew after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the year 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce voting periods in advance, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the election and withdraw citizens with a judicial file their voting right.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
The Republican authorities have made it difficult to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people aged to vote, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
However, it often costs more than <0x24>100 to get the required ID card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than <0x24>35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
A lot more.
Students, voters considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their ID card with photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to submit such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
Two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers sponsored laws abolishing voter registration on election day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not inconsequential.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures taken since 2009 have reduced the enrollment rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the voting period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter accounted for only 13% of state voters.
The same goes for the Hispanics.
These accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, white voters who made up 76% of voters only accounted for 46% of voters voting in advance.
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The attorney general of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to reduce the damage in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the support of the laws that have been voted on and see an obvious goal of influencing the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Centre shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to assert with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present false results, with false negative results or even false positives, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men who are already reluctant to pass screening tests even more hesitant?
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination among the testimonial groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, found a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that one is between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if not detected.
So I recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by opting instead, in these cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be advised to do active surveillance and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
Increasingly, the criteria for deciding who should or should not be dealt with are clearly determined.
I recommend going through the test anyway.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if you should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that if everyone eats well and moves well enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one else smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
It greatly affects people’s health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting cigarettes, the risk of dying from cancer fell by half.
The weight
Embonpoint and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer,” he added.
L'alimentation
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In excessive amounts, it increases the risk of getting colorectal cancer.
Carrots too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“The latter can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one of them noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
“Passing a screening test doesn’t give cancer.”
The Higgs Boss Decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole lot of excitement last summer, and for a reason.
Indeed, it is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, nothing but that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it's still not completely sure if it's Higgs.
It is undoubtedly known that an authentic new particle is held, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seems to confirm this, but data is still lacking to be perfectly certain.
Let's just say it's a good Higgs, since the odds of mistakes seem thin, and let's see what it's all about.
There is, in this low world, a fatally inevitable law that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
But even if the physics of particles is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting of their carats in a certain way.
From there, physicists categorize particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And in the other boson, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means they can be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the melons, which we will not address here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature would appear to propagate, and to which some of the bosons will be scattered.
These bosons, it should be emphasized here, are not all animals as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "message" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field at this precise location, somewhat like a whistle thrown into a pond.
From this "disorder" arises an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the "force-bearing" bosons.
Stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, in this difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for that boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it takes very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why it takes an immense particle accelerator like CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27-kilometre ring of circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is not all particles, or all materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself on a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while others (such as the photon, yours) do not.
Now, what "can bring" all this research, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any gap between observations and predictions of the MS.
In addition, there are a number of people who are eager to be found, as the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and dig some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-ups!).
But there have been no such gaps in CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of these researches in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. Tout-le-Monde are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not be one.
Bear in mind: In the early 1960s, the laser pioneers at the Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work was going to trigger.
They were interviewing scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 - fired us, initially the laser was rather seen as a "labo gadget".
Imagin...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the search.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although not at all its original intent, now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in physics.
This, of course, does not mean that LHC activities will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... <0x7C> The duty
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec has recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, in this essential area, much remains to be done.
The duty has tried to look more closely at it.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The cancer of the prostate that ran him had left him a two-year repeat.
"They had given me five years to live, I had seven years," he said, half-figue half-grass, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived on the eve.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for that," he said.
The disease does its job: a huge weakness that prevents her from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, talks to strangers who deal with him, bring him his medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” he confides.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this pain.
“Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man pisses up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Returning to the child stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept regression," he noted.
For, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called “curative” care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and suffocated".
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
“I don’t have any desires in life anymore,” she said, before accepting that she was wearing a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting for a last visit from her son from Italy in the coming days.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, body care and nutrition help are provided.
It is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
It's very little when we know we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home doctors.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
At the death, we will agree to provide oral care to brandy or Pepsi, depending on the demand.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served Mr. X a beer, who died overnight.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help our loved ones as much as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but do not resemble each other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family meeting in the court, well-calmed in his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having all over the place.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," Dr. Christiane Martel is concerned.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his life, whether at home, hospital, or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, are more or less exclusively specialized in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Québec health care that scares several physicians specializing in palliative care to adopt a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by summits of palliative care including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not performing well enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients only ask to die because they don't get proper care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are strangling their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
The survival hopes of Helena Richard were already minimal when she abandoned chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she answered that she regretted that I was stopping fighting, she told me.
Still, she told me I was done!
No All-Powerful Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who claim to die thank caregivers for not having access to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which returns to sleep the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend to not hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
This report was made possible through a journalism scholarship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Québec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers from political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell day by day what they know of a formidable "system", mixing building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosos.
A " industry " that cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system has been raging since we took the big steps,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive inquiry into the abuses related to roadwork contracts in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had only consented to retreat.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, occult party financing and corruption of officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the only transport ministry would have saved <0x24>1 billion on contracts,” some refer to their instincts to hit a share quota!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors", he adds, hoping it will be able to "demonstrate the stratagèmes behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Anti-Corruption Permanent Unit, established in 2011, also deals with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More police officers from "The Marteau Scout" who, since 2009, have led Montreal's "sewerage cartel" to put the soft pedal on contract swellings...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal voters, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Villancourt, who just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, third city in Quebec.
He is suspected of imposing repeated pot-de-vin in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused by Montreal road engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made sense by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of procurement of public contracts.
For years, he paid 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary that returned the money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sowed at all winds in the 2000s, giving more than <0x24>88,000 (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,000) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals then in power.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts of which it inflated the costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was working round.
Gilles Surprisant, a former engineer in public works, detailed him before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pots-de-vin totaling <0x24>736,000, in exchange for goflats.
Other road officials have admitted to greasing the leg by inflating invoices from 30% to 40%, using fake extras.
Then one of the mayor’s party organizers, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his boxes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal voters to shoot the alarm ringtone.
Mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, east of the island, she insurged in 2010 against the sale of a <0x24>5 million municipal land purchased and resold... 1.6 million to promoters, in full real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will eventually be put in place, she says it "draws on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pinch the wrong ones."
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
We're cleaning up the wound, but we'd need a proper Montreal investigative unit and an eve, so we won't see the dubious practices coming back.
Just like the household.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elected stratagème" when they weren't crawling in the mud!
Estimating the 70% share of dirty money in the funding of election campaigns in Quebec, he ironically said, "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Québec government proposes to limit donations to <0x24>100, but this will not change the figure, he said: "As long as we do not strictly limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a comprehensive review of the system of public procurement and party funding: "We cannot go lower; going deeper, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on more solid foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story twists the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look at it in their own court...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you took on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I walk by their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these things push me to raise my level of play.
And, in a game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not inflaming myself.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine preforming centre to my transition to Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed by stages.
So you will benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s recruits are accustomed to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti contributes a lot to my positioning.
He is shouldered by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Yeah, sure.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, he has no match in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won a lot of titles with hupped clubs.
He's been with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting conversation with him.
I was coming out of a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
What look do you have on the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as a leader.
But we're still in the embossing.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the 8 finals with the way.
What is the club’s goal in this competition?
We're gonna try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we will have our word to say in the face of very good European teams.
First we want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to be able to receive on the 8th of the final return.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and sign up for the duration.
Today, that's not the case.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means for this project to be realized.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we are really looking forward to winning this championship.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, you are supposed to be a champion.
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it’s the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot of us given what has been invested and the players we have.
It's totally accepted.
After that, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, it's certainly a little frustrating.
I wonder what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to set up a game project.
A team builds with time.
In the Champions League, it was proven that we could respond to those present.
Look at Manchester City who hasn’t qualified for the finals for two seasons, they’ve also made a lot of money!
With regard to the amounts invested, you were imagined with 15 points ahead of the troop!
It was to ignore our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won it.
PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's better to say that there's a "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and has a lot of goals.
He came here for that and he proves he's the league 1 star.
He demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
This encourages others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the team of France?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to be part of this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from scratching the game time.
I saw things out there and I got reinforced.
Today, I'm able to make good matches in the selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
Lessons have been learned from what has happened in Ukraine and we need to have an exemplary attitude today.
What look do you wear on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good zero (1-1) kicked off on October 16th in Spain a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everybody fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from pair to pair.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin price, after reaching a peak of <0x24>30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to <0x24>2 five months later, before returning today around <0x24>10 (the rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global exchanges in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She described bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin stands out from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance into a video game that is earned by playing or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority controls and handles exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both account book holders, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in the manner of an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, broadcast throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge introduced to computers, and the winner of which, like a provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hashing phase, i.e., transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "getting" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular imprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructiblely linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because the two have different footprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to a hundred millionth, leaving a margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also highlighted with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had highs and lows.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stolen.
“The fault used does not concern the protocol itself,” assures Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also notes the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Weight actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, “Gigantic Soldiers” were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a textbook on this currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of questioning hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to be imposed, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in the event of success of this currency.
We are leaving Afghanistan. We are leaving Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and wounded, mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign military presence, such as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, these will no longer be tolerated when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, took place in the order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, overflyed by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban strikes on Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood as a result of struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants surpassed by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahideen, Afghan government and present-day Taliban are joining in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They moved into businessmen, seizing government lands to resell them into lands to build income refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. sub-contracts.
They did not consider themselves; most of them did not, in fact, fight for themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have learned to take advantage of the American breadth: the leakage of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
They sided with the modern world during their exiles to Iran or Pakistan, they enjoyed the benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work to those young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are crawling with mobile phones; TV, and its Turkish tabloids that present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape from central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized, strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But, since the 1950s and long before, his country has depended on foreign aid.
No industry has been reinstated, no dam is in condition, no important irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan possesses immense mining wealth.
This only adds to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to grasp it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to monitor the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s leading employers.
It will also take Afghanistan and Pakistan, of which imports and exports are largely dependent, to re-establish normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops ended on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school of girls, boys, department of French at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "gain hearts and minds" and achieve the task impossible to coincide aids and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), removed in 2012, led, and carried out, in a small number of NGOs, to the benefit of a small number of NGOs.
These works, locally-worked gourmets, were able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cultivable surfaces.
What will we leave as a memory, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often located at more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to get rid of the insurrection of foreign groups, which the farmers have told me to wish for, there should be a small, well-controlled and direct civil assistance in their favor.
A constitution at the force in Egypt
This is a new poker hit by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, he decided to play his part.
Taking everyone to court, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given this Assembly two more months to finish his work.
Two years ago, Egypt relies on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "treat his word" and "pick up the right".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time which forces the brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, this is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy while protesting is raging across the country.
Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this appeal to a hasty vote holds the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text or I keep full powers", they must be put to an end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were lacking in the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked on the door, estimating that they had not been able to make their views valid.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacing members, were added to the hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted.
Commentators also enjoyed the fact that one of the only divergences of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the constituent's pendulum was poorly settled.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Objects of all attention, article 2 remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the "establishment of Islamic law" is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed for more strict application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrity," the liberals replied, who see only a blow of communication.
For according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They are aimed in particular at article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying compliance with the laws with sharia.
According to Egypt’s specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because “people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the premises of a theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are also aroused by the fact that the next rector of this university should be far less moderate than the current.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not olemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" tempera Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "there may be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms employed borrow from the religious vocabulary.
Reference is made to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question in the future could be to what extent civil judges are competent to decide on it.”
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nonetheless, civil trials in military courts will be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they deem liberal.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, in particular the press.
In addition, no article echoes the protection of women any more, says Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
Support from the head of state will be given to them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the Center of the World and a sea of salmon await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Facty has retained five great reasons to go to Israel.
Go Adoring the Holy Places
Become a must-have: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever enters these "baptisms" will be touched by the Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of Jesus’ miracles: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
This is exactly where Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is well in Jerusalem.
Believers walk along the Rue de la Souffrance or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the Pretoria), where the trial took place, then leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the place of the Stone of the Unction and the tomb.
This is where the Christian center of the world is located, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which is the remnant of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave small words there accompanied by prayers that are then heard.
Travelling in height
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, a former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineers can get there by their own means.
For others, a telegraph takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the Mont Hermont ski resort that welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are 45 km long.
The old beliefs want pagan gods to have once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit Unique Museums
The country is home to almost 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit all of them during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth the trip.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the very ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
It mainly exhibits the paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of molds of visitors and observers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Rally Museum where you can admire sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which dates back to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the children’s memorial, built on the memory of 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into a total darkness.
The stars are shiny.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Health and well-being
Israel’s three major resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Please note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the water temperature does not fall below 21<0xC2><0xB0> while the air temperature can reach 23<0xC2><0xB0>.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the world’s most unique sea: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, or 417 m below sea level.
The blue water contains salt and very easily retains bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
It comes to perform a treatment based on salt water, lemon, curative mud and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are kept by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in Greek and Egyptian legends of antiquity.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet newlyweds who have taken photo sessions from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you will be able to walk in the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tramway and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, composed of six stations and able to connect the low and high parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The trip in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on the Sabbath.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop their activities.
And the week of work starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only casher food, which excludes pork, seafood, shrimp-free fish and dishes composed of both milk and meat.
It offers a variety of lamb and beef dishes, coconut milk soups and desserts, but also hops, traditional Jewish pasta, various sauces, moulded beans balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that promote high air.
You can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars in the evening.
These felins love past places and don't refuse to give them away.
Renting a car varies depending on the brand from <0x24>37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to <0x24>188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs <0x24>15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists travelled to Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Who has a language, goes to Moscow": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are controversy over what the law will give to the mandatory language test, scammers selling “fake” certificates have already made their appearance in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since December 1, a law has entered into force and stipulates that each migrant worker will have to pass a Russian exam.
Currently, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, services to individuals and retail.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the legal foundations.
You will need to validate your Russian language skills in order to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language are exempt.
Persons who obtained certificates or diplomas of education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this Act.
Benefit, Negative Attitude and Protection of Rights
The network of exam centres will be under the auspices of the Pouchkine Institute of Russian Language, the University of the Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce exams was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law came into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will it give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, according to the representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery to work".
Many are talking about the rights of migrant workers, said Victor Sebelev, director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for unprofessional migrants, without training, those who do not know the language and do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, the future migrant is destined to cross dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded housewife where he and dozens of his likes will torment themselves for 12 days without food and without food.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"With them, one thing is promised to them, and when they arrive, they are misled, their passport is taken, and they do not touch the expected salary," said Tolib Charipov, head of the Tajik Migration Service for Tajikistan's work.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Policeman!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to come to make money in Russia trust that they not only know the language of the country they want to go to, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, it is not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow if only a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families have nothing to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equiping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people start making money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they trust.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
The human rights defenders, however, noted an important aspect of the language law.
The exams will only be for migrants who have legal status.
Without statute, there will be no official examination or work afterwards.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or Defence to Enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 rubles.
And then, you can get a fake registration quickly for only 1500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have fake documents, that we do not have records, hence cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," Oumed Khouchkadamov, a Tajik citizen, told reporters.
“Be quick, don’t hurt and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.”
From the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was found that migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be fake.
Several false language exam certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The counterfeit papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for anything: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these “paper boots”.
Authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first time exam to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take care of the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian arms carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is the shootings carried out during the weddings or the murder organized by the Moscow jurist Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to ban the use of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining a gun permit by making it 18 to 21 years old.
The idea was supported by the head of the Douma Committee for Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the State Douma soon.
Not everyone is pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "closing the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demanded to abandon "this nonsense hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a jurist and crime specialist for the BBC, told Russian service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a registered firearm in the police departments, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that enforcing civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market.
According to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow today at a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factory to the officer
The black arms market is provided through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking arms controls
The first is the "military trace", i.e. the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
“These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians,” Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals to the law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stockpiles and stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often been subjected to explosions.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires have been triggered to conceal the deficit," the former military officer said.
For Baranets, gun manufacturers are there for something.
“We see private arms factories that are not competing with the international market and that the arms are flowing to the black market, especially in Moscow,” an expert said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes handicrafted, a mafia formed and organizes the supply," the former military added.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rossstat, criminal records and the public data of the arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers explain, come from the army and the law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there “because of employees whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture, and 5% are from "illegal sheets".
A salesman and consultant at an armory who has asked for anonymity ensures that no one has been buying the weapons found by these clandestine excavators for a long time; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will be looking for new goods in military warehouses.
A person purchases a unit through a sign, such as an TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the merchandise through a grid.
"He transports it to the city and resells it for 900 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be cleared, they make a check-up purchase from illegal arms dealers," the seller added.
"Like in a luxury shop "
The seller and the buyer usually find themselves through knowledge.
I looked at sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered me to come to the Begovaya station where someone had to take me to a "coin" to trade.
The price of the pistol, I got it on the spot
Victor Baranets as military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, the seller explains. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you have to come also by saying, for example, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American handles with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives it to me because he knows I won't give it.
The little boys are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was “everything we want.”
“I thought I was in a luxury store,” the military recalled.
There is no secret for the buyer, Baranets explains, you can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the seller in the forest and we set up a target.
"You let me shoot and when I'm convinced the weapon is working well, you start negotiating," the expert describes.

Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we don’t need any documents or anyone to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," the ad reads on the site, "Buy a gun or a fighter rifle."
Users leave their requests and ask their questions.
Are we selling to minors?
"Without permission, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (conserved spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and gathers people who wish to buy combat weapons.

I have heard about this type of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People are taking over.
The buyer makes the payment at the automatic terminals.
"He receives back a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," Dmitry Kislov, the secretary of the Right to a Gun Association, said.
Victor Baranets claims that by making a request on the site, one can find one without a weapon and behind bars.

It was removed from long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes has decreased overall in Russia by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles, while cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs have decreased by 7.8%.
U.S.: employees of fast food and supermarkets are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teens go through a cashier job at McDonald’s
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will increase or quickly exhale.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Parallel to the increase in the modest salaries pertaining to basic employees at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organizers of the demonstrations want to get the creation of unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, on "Black Friday", at a time when a heavy rain of residues seized by millions of people struck America and sometimes triggered scammers.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their positions to organize strikes with unions and left-wing activists in the company’s stores whose products are intended for modest and middle-class consumers.
Walmart sells everything from layers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
On average, products are 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many poorly paid Walmart employees do their races only in their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lift trucks or portable scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday protests demanded an increase in wages, complaining that the price of health insurance provided by the company had increased from <0x24>30 to <0x24>100 per month.
For the Walmart base employee who hits <0x24>9.5 an hour, that’s an amount he can’t afford.
Scientists at the University of California Berkley show that if Walmart raised the average salary to <0x24>12 an hour, it would cost the group <0x24>3.2 billion.
That’s 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred the entire increase in wages to consumers’ shoulders, each race in the store would return them to 46 cents more.
They will spend just <0x24>12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8:00 p.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over this period 5,000 items per second.
His cash registers carried out a total of 100 million transactions for Black Friday.
Company spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that “less than five” Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a “com’ operation among so many others” on the part of the organizer’s union.
"Next customer!"
Protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, so they are not yet implanted) but McDonald's and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald’s announces to sell billions of servings and after that they don’t even give you sick leave and they don’t pay you the job you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, the minimum wage foreseen by federal and New York law is <0x24>7.25 per hour.
Fast-foods increase over time, but few, on average, its basic employees hit New York <0x24>8.90 an hour.
No one touches less than them in this city.
To me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald’s after high school while living at their parents’ house.
Few people saw their primary source of income or wished to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald’s employees who complain that they have to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you are going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. near McDonald’s on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least <0x24>15 an hour, more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing the protesters of a trade union by whistleblowers or dismissals.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a trade union, catching up with fast food remains a difficult task, and that’s for concrete reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday gathering near McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the municipal council, who said, "McDonald's announces you don't sell billions of portions of work and after they don't even give you condie.
Protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in the lead, including Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said: "We all have to support fast food workers so they get a fair salary and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has described this event as the most important fast food industry in its entire history.
But only a few hundred people took part, not all of them were fast-food employees, employing tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult to say at the moment whether this mass movement spark will make little ones.
“At the moment, you can only cheat your brain on average.”
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google who unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for a patent.
However, it emerges from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, glasses are already from ancient history.
They are tempted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time trying to broaden the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained so far at the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes at the touch screen.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although the Kinect has made the physical interaction, a lot of things take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information input has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, at the moment, is not really.
We’re trying to change that and we’re working on truly 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
It is necessary to bring the computer world out into ours, into the physical world, to make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
In this way, we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
It cannot be said that it is a panacea: the question of privacy arises because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture <0x2B> voice.
- Is that it?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt depending on what the machine can or not do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If you are interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like about modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we are based in our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In relation to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to algorithm designers.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution according to the axes X and Y, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s are really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, gave the touch sensors a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 <0xCE><0xBC>s, with the current sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would really need a device of this type in my work, but not needing to touch, to have more frames in the second.
But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a common sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem.
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve, and see how this could help set locations.
“As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, strolling all the time with a smartphone with your hands up is not practical, but here is what I think: the best option would be a "transient" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to the smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that’s what makes them strong (personal elements are the only ones you can see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem that opponents of this idea point to the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
My hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image support.
It records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really designed to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air at the ends.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him believe that he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There is still a task below on which it will take a long time to get hurt: the way to make someone who is physically in a very small space that he walks in an almost infinite open space - we also find - we work on the concepts of running carpets made shaped (nothing to see with those clubs)
At the moment, the brain can only be deceiving on average, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: a lot of things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The kingdom of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already hosted prominent actors from the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city’s border and who have found recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this beard-like man, all dressed in red that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the festivities and branched varnishes.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always gather the crowds, no matter where they are displayed.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took into his hands an organ of Barbary and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role by his existence, his philosophy and his image of Bohemia.
- Kirill, why are you going through the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue, for example?
- I chose the red as a seamstress specialized in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not grey provokes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Culture Palace where my works were located.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, of my kind, were incomprehensible.
I began to bond my friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no wave anymore.
I am interested in theater, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to be at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took my place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg Bohemian.
Many were born there: The Names, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in playback in molding shirts, among them was Igor Vdovin, today's fashionable composer.
When the band began to perform live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg did not live up to the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that’s when his great career began, but his training and basic education, it was at us that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboïedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees have gone there as a habit.
I am a hero of the last century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was conducted in the press: it was the prize "The Personalities of Our City".
I was named "Painter of the Year", and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty, and culture of the last century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- A lot of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong up-to-date and sharpness.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum Through Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it scares me to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything fades, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the clothes that matter, one is interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we're gonna have to beat him to the trunk.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
- Recently, we've seen you in the role of the organ player of Barbary. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else but me can play it.
But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be cared for, delicate, liqueurous.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Previously, people were divided into flocks, supporters of the Bohemia loved one thing, denying another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a <0x24>100 ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's the people we throw away that come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come and in the end it's less management, less money, all gone.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to ruin their lives.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones we painted at the end of life.
Nowadays, ideas are often confused.
It is said that there is a spiritual culture, a culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday’s culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of the good tsars, it was not like this, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in Saint-Petersburg who could be experts, but they are distracted, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them a path.
At the moment, it is the “kingdom of taste” that flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find themselves in other museums.
- What do you think St. Petersburg is for you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for that.
And on our stones, art has hard to grow.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, that’s bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who are going to see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very fine.
We have to turn art into fashion as it was at the beginning of the last century.

Birth in space.
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with landers on board set off in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to make our species live as weighers or on a planet of rescue?
I don't think there's much to choose.
In fact, there are two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
"This is Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500.
We can only live at very high altitudes or on Venus' orbit... in space.
We began to take an interest in the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were conducted on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then, insects, small reproductive drosophiles, were placed in orbit.
In 1979, shell eggs were sent into space to see how a weighing embryo developed.
At the exit we get a very normal puppy.
And then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the poultry has to find support, it has to get on its feet and start moving," said Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems Laboratory of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
By not finding any support, the chicks were in a mess.
And at the end of 10 hours, newborns saw their instincts completely atrophied.
The poultry reacted neither to light nor to sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
“We wiped their eyes twice, and then we gave up, because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with poultry in space.
The last biological "miniature arch" with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only embark on the same-sex species.
There was an experience with rats sent with their foetus into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. This kind of research needs to be done," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats of space gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is still not possible to perform reproductions directly in space.
It's not a thin matter.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is able to do so in principle.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, it is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
This kind of experience is not made for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has the most precious.
Our mouse flew and no one on Earth could say if it would keep after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered this question," said Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retired rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, having been in orbit twice and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it poses a danger even during orbital flights," concluded the pilot and cosmonaut, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: compulsory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero floatability, the cosmonauts train at extra-vehicle exits.
The water mimics the weigher.
If for adults, water is comfortable but still a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm that life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby develops about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid from his mother’s womb, it is easier for him to get used to water.
This is logical in principle, because from his birth until his first bath, it only takes 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the newly born child the weightier is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
In contrast, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis are atrophied very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
All right, let's ignore this by relying on birth simulators.
Of course, you can prepare a birth in a special room, the woman will be able to get it out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel terrestrial attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or muscle system.
You can’t dress a baby like an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a child with a disability, wholly disadapted," says the Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, over time this will become a reality, when the Earths will travel in their naves to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institution of Public Finance Control) said: "The control of the pseudo-independent work (in Czech " <0xC5><0xA0>varc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation but is at the forefront of its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Higher Institution of Public Finance Control, said in an interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that’s what’s missing from us,” Kala said in his comments on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abusive practice the " <0xC5><0xA0>varc system " approach by Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as.
Mr Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG would not concern entrepreneurs with controls, so is it allowed or prohibited?
“The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government can’t stop an authority to go inspect and demand compliance with the law,” Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German draft in which the public procurement legislations of these two countries were compared.
What was the concrete question?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for the way in which public procurement and specific national legislation are managed and a practice in itself follows it.
We have gathered all of this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more stringent and of better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not sufficient to continually develop more and more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project do to help you concretely and what will it do for you?
A common control of this kind should just help us stop striving to clarify laws, lower and improve thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and any criminal activity.
But by lowering the market thresholds, this goal will not necessarily be achieved.
It may be that this system is so submerged by paperwork that those looking for the gaps will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different mode of organization?
In the case of institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesbuchungshof operates there, which is organized in a similar way, it also has a board constituted slightly differently, but these two institutions basically act in a similar way.
Skills are also, to some extent, similar, however, with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has accounting courses of this type at the level of the different Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which in our country corresponds to state resources.
The public funds managed at our home by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the accounts of the Länder.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, probably not, but I repeat, I don’t have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country we consider as a model is also facing a whole series of problems.
Otherwise, they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has the amendment of the Public Procurement Act meant for you as an institution, are its effects already felt?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we do a posteriori checks, there is a certain delay.
Our comments concern only, for the time being, the process of preparing for future controls - we have launched a new "mismanagement risk detection" instrument with which we have gone to the crible of nearly 14,000 public contracts - there these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed and the conditions of certain types of contracts have been changed.
So do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or an overload for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulation, the contractor (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) was compelling the subjects to accept that any breach of the law on markets constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
So, is it really useful to make the law tougher in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system should exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal errors without impact on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS was not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system - what does that mean?
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system banned or authorized?
The law must well be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority in charge of going to inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He may declare, "We are going to change the law and authorize it," but he cannot say that we are going to act as if there was nothing.
The Markets Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what makes us lacking.
The roads are through frozen places, but most remain practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowed.
However, the network remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, roads were feasible this morning, but through frozen and also snowy places.
Temperatures have fallen and fluctuate between -5 <0xC2><0xB0> and -10 <0xC2><0xB0> C but they should rise slightly during the day.
The snowfall has stopped in the area and it remains in the plains only a thin layer of snow.
However, the peaks of the metallic mountains (Kru<0xC5><0xA1>né hory) are covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
According to the regional road maintenance service, the visibility was reduced due to the mist.
The R6 highway and national roads in the region are now easily feasible.
However, vigilance remains to be done, for example on certain bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third-class trails, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
It remains on some of their sections of frozen snow remains and by places squeezed by traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to increase their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that certain roads in East Bohemia are threatened by glacier formation and that snow-capped layers of traffic can be found on the roads in mountainous and elevated areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risks of glacial formation in the areas of the Pardubice region located at altitude.
There may be glazes in the surroundings of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 surrounding Svitavy were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e) and the Aigle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov, a layer of snow covered by traffic is present on the roads in the areas located at altitude.
In East Bohemia the weather will be cloudy, but mostly dry for a while.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3<0xC2><0xB0> and <0x2B>1<0xC2><0xB0>C.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region are now feasible, although, in some places, greater vigilance is required and its conduct is adapted to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, the temperatures range between -3 <0xC2><0xB0> and -9 <0xC2><0xB0> C.
After the last snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication paths may be through frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, however, visibility will gradually improve.
This is what information from the regional road maintenance service emerges.
Highway D5 is practically uncomplicated, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometres 80 and 131.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Certain sections can be frozen in the Pilsen-Sud district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third category tracks are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on less frequent roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to the areas of the Olomouc region located at altitude must now have a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the collar called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>, after the chemical treatment operations.
The snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to go on the field this night; according to road services, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk.
In other parts of the region, most roads are practical without difficulty.
"On the heights of the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk there are snow remains.
Drivers driving towards Jeseník should expect to meet at the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" a thick and soft layer of snow ", the head of road maintenance services in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk told <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Their colleagues from the district of Jeseník also visited the site at night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now cleared and wetted, even in the highest areas.
In Olomouc district roads are conveniently feasible, in <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk district drivers should, however, be careful in forest sections on wet roads.
Regions of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, road maintenance services in North Bohemia have reported several difficult sections.
Police data show that in addition to some areas covered in snow or glaciers, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na <0xC3><0x9A>stecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitude, so snow and glacier should stay on the roads. In the plains, especially southeast of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported so far.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of glaciers, in particular in the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow melt during the day, clear skies and freezing during the night.
From the main traffic axes, difficult conditions are also reported on national road 13 at the border between the regions of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of the snow until they reach the pavement.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest said: "Together, we want to collect positive energy. "
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our band The Tap Tap, it’s rather a joke and it’s said that we’re the only group capable of collecting some rest of positive energy to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you’re going to set up a completely unique project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
This is a charity that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11 a.m.
On the evening of December 20th, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will practically end at the time when the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati, located in the Pacific Ocean, will end, on a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who got that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed it with our creator, Honza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys to the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded a hymn against the end of the world entitled "End of the World Cancelled " (in Czech " Konec <0xC5><0x9B>va<0xC5><0xA1>eno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it be heard during these charitable concerts?
Of course, everything, in the end, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The hymns will also join at some point as part of a completely unique live broadcast of Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák who also plays the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech show-biz personalities, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charitable events...
We strive to get them to participate intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it is fun for them.
What are the benefits of these concerts for the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, with the Tap association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Institute and offer them activities that interest them and entertain them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several music groups and performers come on stage at each of these concerts?
Depending on what criteria, do you have the choices?
We have tried to develop a program that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD> will be on stage.
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other “mega events” like this in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the framework of Prague Spring; there too, we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic House in New York and personally, once on site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalistic, so far you have played, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not as bad as it looks at first.
We have five members in an electric chair whose gears have to travel in support, naturally we also pack a lot of luggage and instrument boxes.
So far everything has gone more or less well, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned from, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare what these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, public attitude towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east it is all still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common that a person moves alone in an electric chair in the city centre.
They do not yet consider it an obvious matter to give priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association aiming to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
What else do we need to catch up with the most developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for...
It is important to note that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, at this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and accessibility are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among us.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, let’s go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this band?
I started working as an educator at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a musical activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Lá<0xC4><0x87>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we have a little lost control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I am not mistaken?
True, the fact of connecting with well-known singers and actively working to promote the group helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
The European Union grants also allow us to have high-quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare claim that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, mercy, it is natural.
But mercy is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not beings suffering, abandoned by all, which we must take with pity.
They are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it’s not just an advance for them but for society as a whole.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you’re a demanding leader, as you’re qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and demand a certain discipline.
But I think that's quite normal.
Some people arrive at us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize they have to come to the rehearsal twice a week, follow the preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
A seol, La<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come in and go, there's nothing we can do.
Our doors are always open to those who want or want to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the planned day of the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
The action will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, the three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the band’s song The Tap Tap “End of the World Cancelled” will be sung together.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds (in the amount of CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional training centre Studeo located in Prague at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years old, pre-sale tickets are open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
However, the road from Poland to space began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld's conference at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled " Introduction to Astronautics " .
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the auditors cold and years later <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld received in France the Robert Esnault-Pelteria and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his work "Introduction to Astronautics".
This Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many works devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of world-renowned astronautics, his contribution was rewarded in particular by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the moon's hidden face.
In 1925 a drain was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the drasin.
The only information known about this drastic is that of the press at the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It is evident from the preserved documents that this research had reached the stage of the trials.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakitobomba lotnicza" by an author named Lelibwy-K.
These two projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were conducted by the provisional scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautic Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautice).
For the first time, it is about a company in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problème, which contains four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
At the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) deployed efforts to enter the International Astronautic Federation (created in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902–1959), became vice president of the International Astronautic Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, the RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This 1800-metre rocket was 80 cm long and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
An improved version of the RM-1A was subsequently built, and during the summer of 1959, two-stage RM-2 missile flight tests were started in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962-1965, succeeded the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B that volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of gear was 37 km.
In the period 1965–68, Meteor-2 rockets were developed at the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missile weighed 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Later, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
The entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a COSPAR national committee two years later are still to be mentioned.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in the space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision raised a lively debate in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to examine this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This concretely means that the different economic entities as well as national economic systems are continuously in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of free trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital allied with scary financial speculation.
Significant differences in labour price (salary) create tensions over prices.
Under this term, the following meaning should be given: a producer strives to withstand economic competition by importing low-cost goods by "making them more expensive" than the competitor's price, in order to remove a greater share of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, buying at low prices or disappearing. The result is a significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thereby responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the state necessarily increase.
All this situation intensifies the perfect bad will of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole society by this race for profit.
This situation is so popular that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The scrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the dictatorship of private capital prices, especially in the field of wages.
This is due, on the one hand, to a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, to the restriction of workers' rights in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the RFA, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years that cannot support their needs with their own work.
The number of these people is already counting by millions.
In the context of the increase in competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay an additional fee so that they reach the vital minimum.
Such a scandal has been updated, for example, in the case of employees working as assistants in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the southern Member States of the EU have undoubtedly generated a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to either emigrate (as was the case in their countries in the 19th century) or to invest capital in the sea with wages.
The question here is: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or then a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media say, in short, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the driven economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly advocates the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
We must then ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not direct, according to its own selfish interests, politics and, by the same, the whole state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof of this is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby present in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, by granting mutual benefits, in the legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the drafting of laws to firms of law firms closely related to industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The totality of power does not come from the people, as the Western-type constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is evident that the liberal-oriented democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianus in his work entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State was long in full delicacy and the functions were attributed by violence.
Pots-de-vin, illegally obtained favors, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The under-tables and the corruption were proliferating without limits, and the people were going to the elections with votes already sold." ... "Honest people would not at all seek to get jobs, it would result once the state had been 8 months without consuls. "It was difficult to say that it was a man to Caesar, but we started to say that it was a man to Caesar.
In conclusion, as in ancient times, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the benefit of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and make the interests of society as a whole value.
As a result, today as before, there has been an unprecedented decadence of elites, without any effort to carry out deep reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the scrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal-type democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that today’s elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human life losses, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and internally, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase citizens’ influence on the government and weaken the position of private capital monopoly in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will," Sting said in the song entitled Fragile, whose main verse of the refrain is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be no wars," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have risen.
Some take the party of Israel, arguing about its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its recurring waves of killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in this political situation and did not experience the onset of violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view located "behind the curtain", on those who benefit mainly from tensions that have been going on for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small country in the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to study, others are derived from my own understanding of that, or more precisely of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At any time we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or owe their actions to someone who was directing their actions on the basis of previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we are living in an age where world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been able to be achieved in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth is the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the peacock (I don’t know if these families still have a leader but I don’t exclude him).
There is little written about them.
Of course I do.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the world’s first news agency (Reuters) to put an end to links between their name and serious criminal acts that had always meant to them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They have major stakes in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or conducting wars against countries in which they do not yet have such stakes (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after the central government under control of the Russian-Russian invasion of the Russian Empire was only 4, after the renversation of Kadha.
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew Rothschild's Bank of America's central bank status and began to issue his own money during the civil war (government, I understand well) and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began to issue own money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was murdered in 1963, deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to file a lawsuit against the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for global power led in the years 1859-1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated to the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The aim of the first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to abolish colonialism, particularly British, and the third was to reduce the world population by between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such as a total number of slaves) to be sufficient for their ultimate, universal, luxurious, and comfortable religion.
The method used by the clan of the wealthiest families, headed by the Rothschilds, is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos).
These solutions are false and still lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to avoid repeating crises like the ones they caused in 1907).
After succeeding in triggering the First World War by the assassination of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justifications (war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
In order to facilitate the triggering of the Second World War, the bankers have allowed the politicians to create a latent conflict situation: on the one hand, they have imposed on Germany, on the other hand, far-reaching war-repairs, thus generating the conditions for a simple radicalization of the impoverished masses.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspires to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the Arab local population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers initially held it; or if all that he did was planned, however, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the camps of concentration by the common sense of the world creates the basis for them.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that war repairs imposed on Germany were the source of World War II, the founding of the State of Israel ignited a firehouse that could cause a third world war.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during World War II, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (it is enough to see how people sharply divide between supporters and advocates of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a mistake generates another error according to an endless cycle of violence and where, at the origin of everything, is found the greediness of certain individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world?
There is a difference here between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as with us, international bankers offer people elections only their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to trigger a war with Iran, which could, because of the country's membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which is a wide-ranging organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) that will control the world's two-and-a-half-month conflict.
David Rockefeller said in 1994, “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which a newborn is seen to be implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a fully controlled being.
"Let them all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, take a mark on their hand or on their forehead, so that they may not buy or sell anyone who has the mark of the beast or the number of his name."
It must be understood that the one who makes good sense counts the figures of this wild beast.
This is the number of the man, and it is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist students attacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and hostaged 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not give the U.S. administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously disturbed the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, further aggravated by the fiasco of the attempted release of hostages by force.
The abducted diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate sparked a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle contributed heavily to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, directed by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory for America.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated peripheries, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a rock-eyed cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a shooting team that came to make footage for a major science-fiction film.
Combination of genres
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan calls for Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported this film project, press conferences were organized, and a fictional production company had real offices.
Details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a part of a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful hit, a betrayal - such as, for example, in Ocean's Eleven, Twelve and Thirteen trilogy.
The ambiances follow: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations were re-transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to re-start his career remarkably.
As a ridiculous actor, he became a respected screenwriter and his acting stopped sparking ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film not to take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above the Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive for its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The screenwriter must have been content with a subject that in fact offers few exciting scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It turns out very well, it sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is distracted by a phone call in America and the prosecution by sniping them on the slope are shot by the axe.
The weakness of Argo lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-workers, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from that, the only ones in this case.
Affleck’s film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it lets itself be seen with a moderate interest, appreciating the performance and retro style of the 1970s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story yet, in some way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the case.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankonipoplatky.com, which conducts a public survey of the most absurd bank charges every year, has now decided to launch the regulation contest or ideas from the "EU workshop" of the most absurd.
"The fact that the EU is considering adopting a 40 per cent women's quota for the management of large European companies in recent times has been at the root of our decision," said Patrik Nacher, the organiser of the survey.
One of the absurdities mentioned is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
However, so far, women have been given preference in terms of life insurance rates because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
“The vote will take place before the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the obligation to add bio-components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a significant amount of direct fuels or a small amount of substance.
Criticisms have also been issued in the past against the ban on the use of the term "tartin butter" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
The quality bananas should be 14 centimeters tall.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose requests are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (as the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the root of the fact that in the Union bananas should not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curve".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
Standards on fruits and vegetables have been softened despite the opposition of some states, claiming that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize will be awarded in this survey to the last year’s EU regulation that must include on the inflatable balloons a warning that children under 8 years of age should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to a U.S. investigation that balloons are, among toys, the first cause of deaths of children due to suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to blowing in fair trumpets.
At home, too, we have strange ideas.
The following rule concerning the European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Let's Do" association of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com named in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation concerning the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and thereby risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found the idea of paying money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for subsidy.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague.
“The fact that we don’t have sea disabilities.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund." This is how the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), expressed himself in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that because of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had found itself with full stocks that it had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
Ultimately, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organised a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Subsidies for the obtaining of grants were offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), which were intended to be used in the preparation of grant applications granted by Brussels.
The EU declares: "Bizarre regulations are rare".
While the Regulations often raise criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning as well as in the field of its overall development are rather commendable.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of using EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States during budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific denominations for these traditional products (which it does not always win) raises strong emotions among the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky", for the name "Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum" which dates back to the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuák".
Only cane sugar alcohol-based products, and not beet sugar-based, can be called rum.
In the official list of EU-registered products, there are today in the company of world-renowned cheeses such as the Feta or the Gorgonzola, the Lübeck massepain or the Parma ham, the biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carpets of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elic and Poho<0xC5><0x99>elo chbo<0xC5><0x88>.
Pardubice spicy bread ("Pardubic<0xC3><0xBD> perník") and cakes called "Cornets de Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice " ("ho<0xC5><0x99>ick<0xC3><0xBD> tube<0xC4><0x8D>ky") can also be proud of their Community brand.
“People want me to save the Republic, but I’m just an amateur,” said Senator Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how did you come up with the idea for the presidential election?
It's not to be a senator or president that counts for me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn’t be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer bear to see how the country has been robbed over the past twenty years, that thieves are not under lockdown and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don’t like, then I try to bring a solution for it to change.
And since I am over forty years old and am an independent member of any party, I have no other way to influence the situation than to present myself to the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set out for the Château (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency).
Do you not turn your back on those who have chosen you?
I've always said that I'll go to battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Subsequently, I clarified that if I were elected a senator, I would be present in the presidential election.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we stand at the bar or in front of our television station, but we are also walking all those who are trying to bring about change.
Added to this is the press that breaks people’s reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lying.
For example, I have been told that I suspect journalists or that I have been the adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You have started the fight for the Castle with as a battlehorse the themes of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK].
You have to change the law for this purpose.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I pressed for tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained cause gain.
The problem is politicism: when someone arrives from left or right with a good project, it is consciously refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of any party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorization and dogma supporters, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself a man of the right or of the left?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people place me rather on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we're moving forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but that people are gathered together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the ODS, and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone tells you that you are a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimum goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have spoken about it.
But without the support of Parliament, there are only slogans left to you.
You won’t survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any choice.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them in my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then eventually explain why they don’t want it.
When there is a strong personality that identifies abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, which was achieved through the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, without a trade, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I've just started politics and I'm trying to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm trying to move things forward alone, and if it doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and I'll be back in the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that a single person can’t make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to come to the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencova who revealed oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really dissatisfied but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did, for the most part, gave their votes to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose changes.
In spite of all this, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of the regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if each potential member's past is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I also don't have money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property to about 60 million.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth eight million, a collection of artworks worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a boy’s dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving in a car, being gallant with women and fighting against evil and abuse.
You’re driving an Aston Martin, you have a fortune worth <0x24>60 million and you don’t have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don’t want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have <0x24>15 million for this campaign.
Should I be indebted?
I've already invested two and a half million dollars in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that my program is not of great interest.
I'm not obliged to pay this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign fees are generally covered by the salary I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn’t live in it, for example, paying for my son’s English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I would not run for any election.
Are you going to continue your business activities in order to live?
Didn’t you say that you would put your business in silence?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take the lead of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
I still have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would put an end to my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the Práva newspaper.
The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince yourself, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected book mountain - 2 photos
"I find this building funny, it makes very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the bottom of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large neighboring company, tells us, “Yes, it’s really pretty, this building.”
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Nowadays, no one goes to one of these ringing libraries at all, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing to do with the doors of Rotterdam, holds a very special record.
The community of 80,000 souls shows the lowest rate of education in the Netherlands.
In order to give back a few neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of cute small miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get back to the statistics: building a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam MVRDV Architects' Office, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of mind-blowing and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with its usual phlegm and presented himself at the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and one on the shoulder.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at each other, distracted and shaking their shoulders, Maas, facing him, stacked his book of choice in order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his discourse stunned by activist arguments with one: "common love!"
Here is my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse books, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain fell off the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few mitoyene buildings and houses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the Book Mountain received the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
It is thus that this small, ternish burgade, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a town hall of a stunning cowardice, whose white facades invite to think they are home to a dairy, has been enriched with a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Way to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under a cheese bell.
Sure, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you dig the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The completely glass-made interior is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant reverberations unambiguously speak the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, the rays of the library are located along the facade and in the middle there is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” explains Willy Maas.
We have completely disrupted the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the book mountain has been properly arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes lambris, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircases.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened building architects and engineers don’t want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
That's how one day we found in a farm fries an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membrane of one millimeter thick has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're saving time.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, as well as Dutch croquettes and pot ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal humidity level of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
“It’s amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermia.
Although the mountain of books is located under a glass bell, the sun only briefly illuminates the interior, even on the days of beautiful weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted across the glass facade serve as a sunscreen, intercepting much of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated stores take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the voids of the library which was not yet fully filled (today it counts 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty library."
“I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it’s only for decoration.”
This is how MVRDV achieved the master discipline, which is called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Even though she may seem young and under-educated.
It is finally a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans have to play a bigger role."
Germany chose to abstain during the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on U.S.-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians’ request to obtain observer status from the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
What's wrong?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious as it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to affirm its independence, but not to be too critical of Israel.
During the insurgency in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Eventually, NATO imposed this measure.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is revising its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy, so to speak, defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are fighting on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still hesitant to find this role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as in France or Great Britain
So what does the term “normal” foreign policy mean to the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions that are independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, hence by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany’s position on the conflict in the Middle East and its abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first had major outbreaks in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to contradict public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is at least a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Is Germany declining its relations with the United States by choosing abstaining in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Perhaps even that Germany will only be more respected.
In fact, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
The United States, on the other hand, announced its veto with a clear voice.
Is there a difference between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the U.S. domestic policy scene.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly demonstrates a great understanding of the European position.
But given the country’s political configuration, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you’ll notice that Obama is far from exaggerating with enthusiasm for Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don’t think that makes things easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not the case.
They cannot therefore encompass a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing in the euro issue.
In my view, Germany will in the future assume a role of locomotive and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Will Germany play a role as a major actor on the international stage, does Germany just want to take on a key role?
Or is it still difficult to take on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable for it and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If you look at, for example, the euro crisis, you notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn’t make things easy for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It has to be composed with very different neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this void, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don’t like it, even if it’s unpleasant and if they’re just less appreciated, it’s life!

"Marketing Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands worldwide.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially filed in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the company that bears its name cannot complain.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd get a cause gain.
“It’s increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, attorney at the Taylor Wessing firm specializing in property rights violations in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives at my office.
Imitators only need a few additional letters to be able to register their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sportswear.
Pattloch opens a directory that contains the registrations made at the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the Zegna DF Puma brand, a designation that the company artificially created by acquiring a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several-storey shopping malls that sell virtually nothing but counterfeits.
Pattloch’s cases, however, are different: his mandate is to challenge the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese are talking about "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women are designated to marry rich men.
Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame for.
“It’s bad for business, we have to fight this trend,” Pattloch said.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and judicial costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially in the case of expensive lighthouse products.
According to CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion, the world’s third-largest and fastest-growing luxury product market.
However, it is not easy to radiate dubious registrations from the trademark registry and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reported the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the criticised designation had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, as he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the acquisition of Volvo, used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW’s. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against the plagiarists of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the famous crocodile’s gaze in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing admits that it experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have spent the last year from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a normal recovery".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type have been closed, representing a 75% increase from the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures are still undergoing at the office.
Acting costly
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the agency, this is a record and this means that China is ranked at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world for the tenth time in a row.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each record reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Indeed, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components to be suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain his Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany,” said Hanno Wentzler, president of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office therefore rejected the objection of the Munichois.
Freudenberg certainly gained cause gain from the following two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is set
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of judges.
However, he adds, "the procedure is long, tempting and takes us a lot of time and money."
The internal costs are also difficult to assess, and the Archives Service has even had to review the acts of the past 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even offered in vain to the opposing party a "big six-digit euro sum" to settle the dispute.
“That’s what we see what it represents for us,” Wentzler said.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overwhelm Europe.
This would be the case if the imitators of this region were to ensure the operation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit in Germany the name Freudenberg for a footwear and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: “Watching is on the move.”
Pattloch and he advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
According to them, it is not enough to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should instead “register also in China everything that is likely to be protected,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place in the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: toss your foot, sing, help
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphans of Swaziland’s AIDS are delighted to come.
Here is the story of a link that crosses far more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we tap the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, sneakers for ladies and mocassins for men look for the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly amplifie—alto, bass, tenor, and soprano—and they pick up, whisper, and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old orchestra leader almost loses his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are on Monday night, the choir Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers aged 23 to 69 have come, from the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
To be helped to help each other
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary education institution.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This sum guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a hot daily meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi in Zulu means "songwriter of stories" or "songwriter of praise".
No one can speak the Bantou language in this area, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that she brought to Germany to now return to her native region: South Africa.
For 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the voice power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some living in modest straw or land huts and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken their parents away.
In Esitjeni, the diseases that plague Swaziland can be observed on a smaller scale: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure which nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction of the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s population is infected with the immunodeficiency virus, and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis especially saw many children in the street who were lacking not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is absolutely no prospect.
At the beginning, it was just a few people who personally committed to paying a few euros a year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since been working almost professionally with orphans of Esitjeni's AIDS.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial ISTs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorrhea (or gonorrhea).
Common ISTs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubis lice and gall belong to parasitic ISTs.
Which groups are primarily concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhea often appear in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is the cause of at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonasis, candidiasis (fungal), blennorrhea and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In young people, the rate of chlamydia-related infections is significantly higher than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth from the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscess in the genitals, urine pain, white loss, lower bowel pain as well as the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not regularly exert any pain or other symptom and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close bodily contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who changes sexual partners often undergo regular exams.
Most quickly detected ISTs can be cured and late sequels can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds that chorists collect through their voices throughout Germany, the funds accumulate.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well-located, for example, at one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, so called the old women in zoulou, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them accommodate up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is greeted in a safe place at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chickens. With the competition of the American Health Organization PSI, the association organized an HIV screening test for many residents.
This is not in itself, because even if the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wifes
“AIDS is a real taboo,” explains Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a topic that touches sexuality.”
It's quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned practices, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Yet condoms are found in every corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
“Culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi chorists travel together every two or three years to South Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people at the tip of the black continent still know of.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition as it not only generates good mood and joy, but also sometimes teares away a few gruesome border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the chorists visit their daughters.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Esulweni valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," people say there.
And after a 8,733-kilometre bird-flying journey back to Heidelberg, in front of those chorists who tap their feet in the rehearsal hall of Bergheimer Straße, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice Presence on Mercury
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters in thickness.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the specialised journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet permanently immersed in the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that can go up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one has made any connection between the discovery of water and the assumption of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other vital elements of life have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unperceived by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which infinity is observed.
The image comes from a photographic camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink spots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborns" in the delivery room.
The Spitzer Telescope has discovered the region where the stars are born, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope has photographed the flaming rays of a dying star.
The beige-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic birth room.
The Pleiades, also known as the "seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope puts more emphasis on colors.
In this infrared photo, the Nebula of Helice, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of Verseau.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned it the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular shade.
Only the Spitzer infrared detectors have been able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of Saturn’s rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and clearest photographs the Hubble telescope has taken is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifide Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three stripes of dust divide the heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the premise of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpent: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two fusion galaxies rush to each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble Telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like the technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and consists of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than the common domestic dust.
This photo was developed from optical and x-ray images taken by different telescopes.
You can see the circle of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies named Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, also continuously create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy of bright rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to thicken and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, U.S.A.
It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its uniqueness is due to its large light-gathering capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by contributing to the computational power of its machine.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take photos before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck’s telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory which observes the sky with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope is also expected to be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from us from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space by early 2018 on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will have a mission to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that Mercury’s South Pole also contains ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data have been indicating the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
With the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists have maintained its certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach the worthy ages of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is also a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years old.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach the worthy ages of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is also a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years old.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is a complete romantic.
Along the many turns of the road, the small bus runs along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, you would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But here we are in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh lives, of which much is not known, unless they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and have a very great longevity.
Terms: Lerik.
The small town is plastered with its overly aggressive Soviet-era architecture that does not at all match the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too difficult.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres, because the road has only one path.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilate Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only such museum in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh of the region that are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he reached the age of 120.
Having another child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is Shirali Muslimov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
There is, however, no birth certificate.
And when we think that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Muslimov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva said.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have a daughter.
Would Shirali Muslimov be mistaken for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also told him about the man in the Great Age of Central Asia.
“Surprisingly elderly people also live in certain regions of China, Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the absence of documents, except that there was no civil status record.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, it is in fact that people in the Lerik area often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it is a matter of nutrition.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical of seeing throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a barrel, of which she beats the contents tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children also live in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armored glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his skirt hide long trails of a dark blonde that his son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I've never lost them and they've kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She always ate what came from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda amazes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who has still led his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and his son Ilham succeeded him later.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan are not aware of the distress.
Mirzayeva receives a monthly 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) for her retirement, an amount that guarantees a good train of life in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-time grinning son is right: “Elders enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The “Human Rights” omitted in the Constitution
The revolution resurfaces in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the country’s deep fracture.
The draft constitution based on Sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not awful with words of emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
“And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,” he told state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but also especially to Christian Copts, Liberals, enlightened and secular Muslims.
For all members of the confused and desperate opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world don’t really know what this 61-year-old engineer, a PhD student at the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles drafted in haste by the majority-Islamic assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night force tour are indeed to some extent disturbing.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the margin of legal maneuver that follows to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
In any case, it is worth thinking about a newly introduced article stating that, with regard to all subjects affecting Sharia, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the country's most important Islamic institution and its brightness radiates on all Sunni Muslims.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will oversee the legislative apparatus, which would lead de facto to the oversight of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Moubarak, these courts used to suppress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also, can the project read, protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values”.
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
In addition, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his messengers.
However, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offensive people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or tell a joke to the detriment of a law man?
Many points are therefore to be interpreted in the draft that Morsi submits to the vote and which, according to his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
“The Revolution Renews”
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring Sharia down before it comes into force.
“The revolution is reborn and we are going to win,” Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential election, said.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft constitution is "to be thrown into the trash of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to foster a “putsch against democracy.”
“If he declares the referendum, we will go to his palace and we will overthrow it,” said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated," said Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member, according to Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges announced they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
For his part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-protest not on Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and the supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in large numbers, shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
“Clean our land!” they asked Morsi, affirming that “the Qur’an was their constitution.”
A battle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that’s what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that the opponents of the draft constitution, as well as its supporters, expressed themselves loudly and strongly.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the urns of the leadership that the country must take.
The project of the Islamists will certainly win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did it not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regretted during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are deplorable violations of the rules of democracy and will result in a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto takes away all his powers,” Saeda said.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who watches the battle between different political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could pay off.
A protester on Tharir Square warns: "You are born with a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway’s rakfisk: Is it the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standard of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to the appetite of the locals for an extremely smelly fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty footwear.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes in Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this odor, ubiquitous, impregnates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-powdered trout and fermented in water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can last up to a year.
When the darkness settles and it’s cold, the Norwegians gather together to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
“You eat crude, then you swallow an aquavit glass,” explains Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter who is also called “Rakfisk General”, responsible for the festival’s management.
Around us, people crave small pieces of fish and pour a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” Havard adds.
Drinking kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it’s not bad – it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and – undoubtedly with the senses of alcoholism – was eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly immigrant to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, crossed the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, though smelly, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> each.
Norway does not often speak of it in the international news, which is not to her displeasure.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they evoke this murder, they talk about "the July 22 incident".
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason that justifies our success,” explains Anna, our waitress, with blonde hair and eyes of a translucent blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk plate at hand.
We are, as you say, prudent people.
His English, like that of most people living here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to get noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution – everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money through the windows, during the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the ropes of its stock market tight.
“As much as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy,” Anna says.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand under the snow and I do the tail to buy myself something to eat - I had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger made of enthusiasm, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where you can use rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them – or perhaps for the smelliest of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly node, surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
We believe in the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls off his chair, maybe because of the aquavit abuse.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emanations.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are numerous.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where loopholes are legion in normal time, a safety dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the goal was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico’s economy is doing well, with results due to ex-President Felipe Calderon, but the country is on the verge of a drug war that has already killed about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. President, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populous and tempting state that encloses the capital. On its land of preference, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises attribute it to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of Mr Pena Nieto’s new highways, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once wooded and full of cliffs.
Plaques bearing its name are hanged outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are counting on him to bring about sustainable change,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and the party of Peña Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years of powerlessness, the PRI was defeated in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there is a lot of expectations within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto.
It rejects criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lack of charisma.
He's an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent state man and above all, he knows how to listen.
However, it is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the highway bridges, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military was called for rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women there is particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found on the verge of discharge.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico when Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez – a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to address the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality face to face.
In a concrete house, typical of this demolished neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to retain her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reports a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed,” said Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and body rigidity had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was refused.
The authorities treated me as if I was an old nurse, a troublemaker, a crymaker.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
“But it’s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made the promise that he will make it his priority during his term.
“I hope he will be as good as he was as president when he was governor,” Olvera told Congress in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse that Bradley Manning was allegedly the victim of during his detention.
The trial concerns Manning’s detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to classify the case on the grounds that the abduction of Manning took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried on Friday to demonstrate that Soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the largest confidential information leak in U.S. military history -- missed many occasions to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his detention.
At a counter-interrogatory with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Ashden Fein stated that recordings of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia regarding his treatment were not recovered.
The counter-interrogatory -- during a hearing, the defense filed a request demanding that Manning's case be categorized on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning witnessed his desire to commit suicide during his suicide.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had filled out after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein evoked the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards had reserved for him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had had in prison was overall "very professional."
Forms do not report any complaints for ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the problems mentioned.
"They wrote 'no problem' (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn't mean I didn't raise any problems," Manning said.
Military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to evoke the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to amend his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military said they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know I was doing well, and I wanted this status to be removed... so that I could enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison from the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and that he had disappeared once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he was not kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell—at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours—without company.
Manning also added that the only items at his disposal were a mattress, a cover, tongs, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to stay on the move because sleeping or lying down during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also stated that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards could not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so that he could see his face.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning’s treatments in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico all night, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other detainees one morning during the call.
Manning testified that at no time was allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he had deducted from his guard's order that he should release his cover that could have concealed his nudity, but he admitted that no one had ordered him to release it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he had tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning had told the officer that he could have used the elasticity of his slip or his tongs to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, tongs, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he experienced during his detention and that he will considerably reduce his sentence if he is to be found guilty before a martial court, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning is considering pleading guilty to the least serious crimes and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors arguing that detention conditions were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all the detainees in Quantico.
The prosecutors brought against Manning include theft of public goods or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to national defense.
If all the prosecutors are detained, he will be sentenced to life indefinitely.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He said many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind the Mexicans of the difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says the Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, in front of customs and immigration, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two paths: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I remained motionless for several seconds, not knowing which row to head for.
I grew up in central California, where I have been called the "Mexican" all my life.
This is an ethnic qualification, just as my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italians".
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the land that my grandfather was born, there is no need for special qualifications or a trait of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to manage an interview in one or the other language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of an indigenous, and I can’t lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed to the "Foreigners" row.
I was thinking at that time of the week when the new Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than take risks in the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a trade union on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to hand over half of their territory in writing to the tip of the rifle.
But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as an U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are hurting the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the battle.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to discuss the subject of bitterness?
There's a lot.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and went into the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream that we live, and not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with the United States.
Moreover, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they cheer us up as if we were individuals of lower race and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans more firmly claim their identity and Mexican-Americans are opposed to it.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries.
In addition, many Mexican-Americans that I know do not feel like being part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligences want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexican-Americans to work as wealth ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a great country that we absolutely need to visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, given the inequalities in wages, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to deal with yourself, friends.
That's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States in the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they must accept that some Mexican-Americans still want them in the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another effusion of blood seems to indicate that such a hope is vain.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed in the vicinity of Tehran.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab Spring has blown away, and whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there are all the reasons to think that this could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that does not make any losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to show optimism.
Even though the cease-fire on November 21 continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has led Gaza since 2007, will haunt the Israelis forcing them to abandon, even though Gaza has wiped out a crackdown.
After killing some of its leaders and repatriating the 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most miserable and overpopulated corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently at the hands of its Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken the blame for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The members of Hamas celebrate and say that the growing Islamist curves around Israel, from Lebanon, to the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its domination, to Syria, where Islamist-trended rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where the Allies of the King Ha.
And most importantly, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more easily given to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, supporters of Israel’s hardline will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put in a box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears – for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the cause of the last wave of violence.
But most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who completely ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza’s rocket fire has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide bombings, particularly thanks to the separation barrier that impinges on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state of law, and which protects them from international corruption by continuing their Jewish colonies.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more belligerent party, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman in the January 22 election, has the good part.
Why do these Palestinian bastards sleep while giving them a state?
If they were heading the West Bank, wouldn’t they launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get out of the head.
Perhaps the hard line supporters will take it; but it may be that the Arab spring changes it.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defense budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire which is a good promise -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a dust that is destined to explode one day in Israeli-occupied territories – a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions to Gaza every two or three years to strike Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains that advocated by the reasonable people on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with an Israeli assignment of territory in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give the opportunity to outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which is now committed to ending the movement of arms to Gaza, as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a Jerusalem by-pass.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute far more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state to the United Nations.
Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, he seems just as reluctant to establish one.
It's a very tight vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws on Neutral Cigarette Packages Have Been Enforced in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law entered into force in Australia is a world premiere, the logos and colors were replaced by a dark green olive and horrific photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases were caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the world's strictest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people don’t start smoking before age 26, there’s a 99% chance they never start smoking.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,” said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have revealed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess.”
Even though Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said it would relaunch the black market trade, which will give easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
“Negative consequences will result from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco Australia.
Forgers from China and Indonesia will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask horrific packaging, has increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco disputed it.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only boredom, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertisements, sports sponsorship and the obligation for dealers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you work in tobacco marketing and you only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the must-have place by excellence,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens in favor of brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Do we have to wonder if this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who made a video, or is it a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry went so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new judicial decisions - these countries have told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade deals with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken by the year 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa, and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I don't know.
“You take a cigarette and you store the package,” said Victor El Hage at the time of buying a package with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm going to stop is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in downtown Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store the packages on the shelves.
“Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
“The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, that’s right, we stop and put the key under the door,” he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
Therefore, I have had enough time to think about the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free stores).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development are praising the boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting pathways, or even to nurture creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Oh, yes.
And no.
But I'll be back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes a long way," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, dating back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of "willing to do something but not getting into a satisfying activity."
What differentiates the boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not doing a task even though she would like it.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do something.
What is at the heart of the boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
The boredom can be very much like a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be linked, people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we may think that we are bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened to an article from a handful of people on the tape.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the too loud sound of a TV show that had no connection, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or challenging task, attention interruption can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an aggregated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you’re doing a boring task, “like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you not get bored.”
In fact, he says, now we know that when you are sneezing or sneezing, these gestures, often considered signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gamble learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain motionless,” said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Standard of Predisposition to Boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "Of the tasks I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many centres of interest that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of numerous and varied stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are quick to get angry.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and during their homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not at school.
In contrast, 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether today’s boredom rates, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a period where boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents don't have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question: Is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, bet or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Boring is the way the brain found it to tell you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will no longer be bored, but he will not have learned to take care of himself or self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And “this self-regulation goes from one situation to another,” he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more control of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the boredom.
Just like I don’t think we should criticize it either.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant boiling generated by activities and technology is the goal we should aim for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom arouses an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate stopping times.
“In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to jump into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directives for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and footballer in Colorado, is accused of something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and a few friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a citation to appear for possession of drugs and material that could be used for his consumption - minor crimes, each accompanied by a <0x24>100 fine - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is it one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado’s vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been classified as unsuitable.
Police have stopped accusing adults aged 21 and over of minor marijuana possession, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to blame those who own it.
At the same time, several suburban cities from Denver to the Western Mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana stores in their neighborhoods.
“Things are evolving so fast that I don’t know what the future holds for us,” said Daniel J. Oates, the head of police at Aurora, east of Denver.
The Washington State regulators are also asking themselves a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidance on how to install a license system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether you like it or not, is ahead of most marijuana regulatory states, first with regard to therapeutic use and now with regard to personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, admits Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no previous reality on which we can rely," he said.
The Washington Act, called I-502, comes into force on December 6, leaving a legal void of one year, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
In the meantime, practical questions remain: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees proper access to approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis stores within a 30 km radius around a school, a park, a playground or a playground.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis trade, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Cannabis Legalization Center, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, the police chief, Oates, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City Attorney" would no longer prosecute people aged 21 and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to "deposit this type of person."
Chief Oates said that the police would implement the new court rulings that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the District Attorney, Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana-owning affairs, mainly in order to pressure users to detoxify themselves.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges.
“Our office is obliged to prosecute those people who have committed a crime that, at the time of the incident, was a recognized crime,” Buck said.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favour of restricted marijuana consumption.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, are no longer showing up adults for possession of limited amounts.
The county's public ministry representative, Pete Hochzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all marijuana detention cases indefinitely.
“I don’t feel like wasting my time applying the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado’s voters supported the measure, providing a legal and governmental framework suitable for personal marijuana use is not an easy thing.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various U.S. cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with public ministry representatives, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the people accused of marijuana use and who speaks as a local spokesman for the "National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws).
“They’ve spent much of their lives prosecuting people who consumed marijuana, too, they have trouble accepting that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to deal with restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are about to become a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state representatives are planning a new legalized sales frontier, they are anxiously awaiting the federal government’s directives, which still sees marijuana sales and cultivation as federal crimes.
Advocates for the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will surrender.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and vendors, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana stores for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are not likely to knock the doors to seize small bags of drugs, there is a strong bet that it is opposed to authorized stores of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not expected federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local administrations approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana stores, even if this is only a one-year postponement.
Last week, the city of Montrose got a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
“We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions are asked.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mined and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not just the students of today who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and my elder brother studied in what was for me a prominent place of knowledge, a sort of modern-day Greek amphitheater that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were upset.
L'Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left the university because I objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said with affair that I left after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yes, I fled, because I had been the victim of bullying and was the subject of constant whistleblowers.
Not because of my name rather foreigner, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for a single reason, and in this cradle of the so-called know, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my sorry father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a partisan of the Conservative Party.
Why should I mention this today, you will tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students are undergoing the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Student Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable” because of their political opinions.
They want a representative within the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Wonderland: Young, Intelligent and Right), which depicted the "Tories" as eccentrics and eccentrics.
Among them was student Joe Cooke, a former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)", who moves in Rolls-Royce, arbores a complete silver and moves with a chrome-headed cane.
In other universities, conservative students are said to be treated like emissaries of the establishment of higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing party in universities.
“People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of the members of the CCR towards those who are centered on.
"This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one who thought that way during my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and with paralyzing timidity.
The hate of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted against granting Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, due to the reduction in higher education funding.
The atmosphere was filled with Stalin's vibrations.
From the first days of the reception week, when the new students met the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards.
I found out that the teachers not only participated in the sarcasm towards Tory students, but also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on strike minors, privatization and the government’s opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved in the classroom woods.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim was about a translation into English of 18th-century French texts, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pussy face, was easy to take.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he said in a harrowing tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
During dinner there tonight, I sat alone then I felt a slight tape on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
I'm afraid he'll be like that.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your dad's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even harder for you.
Most Tory youths claim to be Labour (workers).
Later on, at the local pub, I loosely tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with all that Mrs Thatcher had said.
This stratagem has failed.
A student in his first year of philosophy, political and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took the refrain.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the Liberal Legislation of the 1960s.
Could I have just lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I have become a worker and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly professor Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-Determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started making the shuttle between Oxford and my parents’ home in London, finding shelter with my family and more open-minded city friends.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unfaithful.
During his studies in Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with the dreaming bells.
Even my communist friends had impeccable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's for tackling you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his beliefs.
During a session of work conducted the following week, when another history professor seriously suggested that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Internally crying out for shame, I admitted to being the victim of brainwashing my parents and treating them as “old crazy.”
The repeat was short-lived.
It was my father who pushed the last nail of my Oxford box.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press each week.
My door was locked.
I remained carpeted in my room, and after five minutes, my persecutors abandoned.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can treat me as a wet chicken crynichard.
But no 18-year-old child should be the victim of such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but also has an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Sewing", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian sewing artist.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The seller recognized it at the opening of "Valentino: a Master of Sewing", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high sewing models created for his sewing house over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the highlight of a story whose only protagonist is "Mr." Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, you will find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest couturier of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet set.
There is nothing wrong with loving the kingdom.
“At least, they don’t crush their cigarette bumps on your beautiful carpet like some pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and welcomes with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his Gstaad cottage," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Place d’Espagne in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the Haute-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
“He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art,” she concludes.
Nobility line parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He likes well-educated people and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamour podium of sixty meters wide that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to scroll on the podium to admire a "public" of the dream, carrying the main creations of Valentino's Day, with the "singer" and the "singer" of the mandy, like the one with the tailor Jack had.
Among this audience of models are names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly well.
It was a pants, a shirt, a gillette vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift he had given me,” said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier’s muses.
“I prefer him to everyone else because of his femininity, his great love for women, and because he sublimes our beauty,” the former Duchess of Feria added.
I like the colors he uses, they are bright and lighten the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Eventually, this was possible at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward of Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a skirt, a draped bustier, and a necklace to fall.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg preserves the couturier's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories she carries."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is the Marie-Chantal Miller wedding dress worn during her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturier calls his couturiers) to make this ivory silk dress with beads, twelve different kinds of toothbrushes and a draw of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high seam of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obsessed for years by the "knowledge" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani brings together as many honors as any of his clients' wives.
“Its sophistication, its calmness, its carefree and perfect appearance have always jumped into my eyes,” says Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years had no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The hardest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilograms of sulfur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their lives by bringing the sulphur of the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It has to work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfur gas emitted from the earth’s intestines solidifies into contact with the air.
After collecting large sulfur rocks, which weigh in total nearly 70 kilograms, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters up to the peak of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters above sea level, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle’s beam, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipitate.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once up there, they pave a path between tourists photographing them as if they were circus beasts, and carrying heavy baskets painfully, they walk the 3 kilometres up to the scale that a mining company has installed a little below 1,850 meters of altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) per kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry as this mineral is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
“As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip,” explains Anto, who generally travels three times a day.
Each takes 3 hours and ends exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misfortune for such a superhuman effort, it is triple what it would gain in the fields.
“The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” said the carrier who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sulfur itself.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes hard, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes hard, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that the volcano discards.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
“I’m going to work two more years, because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Stunned by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wooden mass with other carriers, rises every day at two in the morning because the sulphur keeps sparkling at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and glows in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater illuminating himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not touch one of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) of camera increase, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for animals, not for humans,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old bodyguard who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 pounds, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", as he needs money to raise his three sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of serious diseases... to which of course they are added to their psoriasis, their usual psoriasis, their psoriasis and respiratory problems.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometres from there by a trail of goats invaded by bad herbs.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening her mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but the perpetual misery from generation to generation is one of the most difficult trades in the world: the one that makes the human mules of volcano Kawah ljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans take responsibility for this absence of children on career, stress and the cost of access to property.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unthinkable that these words come from an advertisement for peppermint pills, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to that, the video spread like a pull of powder on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polychinelle in the drawer" to joke about Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency at the origin of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertisement.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music for people to fulfill “their national duty.”
It is only for the Internet, so we could make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of natality, so we felt it was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like launching perfumes to pheromones or organizing speed dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we’ve said the following to ourselves: what’s more creative to solve this problem than making it a rap song?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore does not take it as lightly.
He spends <0x24>1,300 a year on politics to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers grants up to <0x24>15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, said it was due to “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and the creation of a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and the delay in marriage and childbirth, resulting in a decrease in Singapore's birth rate.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that are plentiful with barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese who are accused of lowering wages and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore experienced its worst electoral results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the setting up of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale wins a lot of success.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these housings build much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to promoters, who were previously put in the wheels if they wanted to offer too small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If so much is that these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center, it would seem that they are not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that's why people put it back in later," a young manager said.
Other people can have children.
“But for me, it’s important to be able to have my money and my time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, the stress and cost of access to property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
So, while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the privacy domain that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for those under the age of 16?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" personally and "password and username" when applying it to social networks.
“I’m not going to reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” said Jorge, 10, when trying to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
“These are very secrets, my mother may know them but not everyone,” he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I’m not going to share any of my photos or someone who would make a fool,” he said.
The young boy admits that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he added.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or with my friends, quickly,” he says.
He said he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will also not trust anyone who would recommend him a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter he admits not to know 20 of the people on his friend list.
“I don’t care because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the young boy, no one made any advances or asked for his address or phone number.
“If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would just delete them from my account,” he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyber-hacking are not alien to the young boy.
A close friend of a friend of mine was racketeered on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He just passed it on as a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to set up his account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I was angry or angry.
"Even though I know it's cyber-hacking," he says.
Key Issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to educate children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information but, with the advent of these sites, the rule of the game has changed,” she said.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who are born with technology.
“We’re the digital immigrants that we have to teach them there, while we’re learning on our own,” she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a definite criterion on whether or not to disclose, publish or tell at an age where they do not have the maturity necessary to do so."
“We also ask them to be selective while what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents about privacy is to use questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do it is useless," she says.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people permission to identify them?
Also, does everyone need to know what you’re doing every minute?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“In the world of the Internet, everyone has to act with respect, morality and other principles, it has to be the same on social media,” she says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and education counselor, says it is essential that parents read the terms of use of social networks consciously.
Understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid basis to discuss with their children the implications of opening an online account.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published,” he says.
According to the Guardian, it is essential to remind children that they should not speak to foreigners.
The UNASUR summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven representatives present.
Efe has tried several times to access the document signed during the VIth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be released after the closing of the summit, and then stated on the Internet at one time that it was published on the website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by Peru's President, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to the information on the summit has been constantly restricted.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private, restricted audio session" was broadcast in the press room.
Few information circulating among journalists was given by press officials from some of the UNESCO governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South American Summit of Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this was promptly requested by the press, it had also not issued the declaration also called the Declaration of Lima, as it had previously been mentioned.
On the official website of the ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgement by the Hague Court that crosses a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the decision of the CIJ to hear the advocates of both parties in the trial Lima filed against Santiago and which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we are bringing to this international court today," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts," President Piñera added, handing President Humala a hand.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international court, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua that it deemed to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been suspended by UNESCO since 2011 after the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
He read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between South American countries for a total investment of <0x24>17 million.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of the UNESCO would put in place “significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits.”
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, low-cost internet access throughout South America, and to assess jointly and efficiently the risks of crime."
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (from Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should help increase our productive matrix and see a better future for our populations," said President Humala.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circles,” he said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concern Peru and were located on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a larger connection with Ecuador although it did not give any details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
“We hope that this country’s electoral process will allow it to be reintegrated into the Union of South American Nations,” he said.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another topic addressed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaragua counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a CIJ judgement requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these pathways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we are going to settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takeover of the country’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, as part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the UNESCO, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru assumes the pro-temporary presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” Rafael Correa said.
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should set an example for Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the VI Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, told state television TV Peru that the Europeans "were interviewed during World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they were forming a patriot."
In this regard, he defended the project of establishing South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of the UNESCO.
"We have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still areas of reaction that we want to make to belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador has expressed his support for the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who knock our ears never compromise on anything, on the contrary, we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding," he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but he has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were reasonable suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice that demanded that he be subjected to an interrogation on his territory regarding a alleged sexual offence while "the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconferencing, which could be done since the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious,” he said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
“It works on anyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa notes that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the assignment of a non-conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the authorities to find a foundation of the European Union.
We are not negotiating with human rights, we are not using this word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings against different European courts," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain gave the exception from tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as fully permitted by its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression."
“The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not malicious or perverse politicians, but bad journalists at the expense of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
From this point of view, he congratulated himself that this was not the kind of journalists “neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador” and, rather than highlighting his re-election, “it would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and trace the right path”.
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within the UNESCO at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should show firmness and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, it would destroy the paraguay, "they destroyed it."
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries through the judgement of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
They need to be solved together to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the dispute over the maritime borders opposing Peru and Chile within the same court and said it was “benefitful for Latin America to seize international instances if both countries agree to accept a judgment so firm that it is.”
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, with a view to a third consecutive term, he said he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa said that if he lost the primarys in February 2013, he would retire from public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
“My political movement thought it was me who guaranteed this eventual victory but we must accept that responsibility,” he said.
If I win, that would be my last presidential term and then I will retire from political life.
If we ever lose, I will.
“This is my decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just discussed with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of President Chávez's health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed the test result: HIV-positive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the moment of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about him and his bitterness was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he recovered in 1994 after numerous battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmatizations.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him “because he was voiceless.”
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, “depleted” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first cases reported, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV unit validator, Jaime Andrade said in a press release that this year was published in Ilferrieva.
The HIV/AIDS infectiologist and expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, the scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of the CD up to 200 assignment of the immune system.
Simply put, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," the scientist explained.
In order to replace this progress in its context, one must know that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of deaths from AIDS has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60% of national patients have died from AIDS.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So, why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we have never missed medications, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an undeniable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive while they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnosis and, for this, we need to propose screening tests massively, to all people who ask for it."
The specialists and members of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had complicitly done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a patient with AIDS.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better that I explode three times a week,” they say, “that’s not my case.”
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
To this day, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but I take care of myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who have the Mare of the Sea today.
Let them do the test, if they have taken the risk, the sooner they will know if they are HIV positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
Its message summarizes the slogan of the fight against AIDS this year.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, supports Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "the distribution of condoms has actually been increased, before we were given one or two of them, now we are given a hundred packages, that's very good, but as a result, some still do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
The question: "What are you going to do about it?", posed with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, orientation counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, the journalist assures.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but that they be found in public toilets distributors and in places where young people visit.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
It is also not about paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
“It’s not how sexuality works, it’s best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,” he said.
Statistics in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is the 4th state in the country in the number of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% by blood, and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each recorded case there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it.
A U.S. court-appointed ruling ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt agreed through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, causing a bad precedent for all national corporations with branches in the neighbouring country and having solvency problems.
It seems, therefore, that the surviving procedures of companies authorized by Mexican law are not valid in the country under the flag, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the coup brought to trial on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Northern District Court of Texas, leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of an embargo on their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the major glass maker of Mexico to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must register under U.S. bankruptcy law, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, located in New Orleans, claims that the main proceedings are the formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-company vote, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by subsidiaries of Vitro to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are a half-dozen examples here, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, of which the Federal Institute of Commercial Failures had secured the debts.
In addition, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the courts of the United States, i.e. the "vatour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool did not obtain.
The vote was 45 votes against 37.
A statement omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without stopping from the severe economic crisis facing the United States, impacting costs to the country.
So far, the González Sada family company will appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance appeal will demand non-prosperity and require the review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("Friend of the Court") in which the procedure followed by Vitro in the framework of the Commercial Bankruptcy Act was detailed, noting that this freed him from the agreements signed by the two states at the same level as the one for the Allied.
In addition, he noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-part scrap: they take over Vitro and they take over the country.
General balance sheet
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the company's former boss, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, have been silenced for several months, this one was accused of fraudulent administration, the Aviation Pilots' Association problem has already renewed.
The case, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking and Value Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has consistently denied providing information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw 198 million pesos from the F/589 trustee of IXE Bank on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They Sit on the Dragon Mars
Meeting at the weekend in an amphitheater at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad opposition front to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the Great Wall country, with a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the South-East area to oppose the monumental project, which is partly in protected areas and represents the largest of all the threats to industry.
The ACTA is dead
The government has raised a demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Fraud Trade Agreement, known under its English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As everyone knows, it was well-known that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered a violation of freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
"Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the field and, thanks to him, traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as large as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain haemorrhage sentenced him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether it be as a lower league player, a national basketball player, manager and manager of the national baseball team, the national basketball team, the NBA Basketball team, and the NBA Basketball team.
"I have worn several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as I was the president of the BSN, the general manager of the national team and the president of the federation during the 90s," Reyes recalls during a visit to his home in Primera Hora in Bayamón, where he has been living with Isabel since his 50th birthday.
"Basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind him of his out-of-standard route, testify to it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves most are the ones that remind him of his passage as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as co-manager or team manager.
"These were my best years, the ones I took most advantage of because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or manager.
This made many years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired during the championship in 1981, the year that Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over the team," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who was the leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a costly player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
This is how Mincy started, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the Federation’s great mantleman.
At that time, he would prefer to take advantage of his and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we got 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn’t made us play again the last game,” Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is that of the 1991 Cuban Pan-American Games, when we won gold and put a raffle on the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not assist in a problem of the world.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy during the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the Imbroglio of the Pan-American Games of Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculín did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team consisting of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In my youth, I like the work that Leo Arill does.
What is your biggest success within the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious period of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island during national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of compulsory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and arbitrators.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, attend basketball games.
And of course, I take advantage of the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he portrayed a scrupulous, fearful and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the magnate of the unscrupulous oil J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R in a new Dallas season, died Friday evening of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., Dallas production house.
“Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her press secretary, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
“He was an exceptional person and he was living life in the depths,” Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he had admitted to drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and had a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had become known on television as an ordinary guy in the "Jinny of My Dreams" series aired by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought it home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in theaters are the critically acclaimed roles in "The Band", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully hateful J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their relatives was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", coined to entertain the suspense around a thrilling episode in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in betting.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had made her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but with a charismatic smile: an unhonest entrepreneur and an infidel husband who was trying to incarcerate his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be written, "Who is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing?"
Here's the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, the co-star of the original series, recalled this Friday Hagman as a "immense man, both on the small screen and in life."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already complete for the second season and a sixth is underway, the channel said.
For now, neither Warner nor TNT have announced how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who met the celebrity with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the theatre scenes in New York in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and he married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': Les memoires implacables de J.R)
“I didn’t write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way,” he told the press at the time.
After his liver transplantation, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist concerned patients.
“I advise them, I give them back confidence, I come with them when they come to have surgery and then,” he said in 1996.
I’m trying to offer them some comfort, like, “Don’t be afraid, it won’t be easy for a little while, but it’s going to be fine.”
He was also an anti-tobacco activist and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and climate warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he was throwing an irresistible heist there: the end of the “great countdown” of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, which many people referred to as the proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charming had no idea what was waiting for him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax spree that some have nicknamed the "Debt Armageddon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists would see the end of the pencil.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we told it, it was a very good time.
And one must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the Apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher to give lessons on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker delivers the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and climate warming.
“We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Associate Professor of History of Art and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled "The End of the World".
"We're adding '2012' to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world doesn't disappear," Professor Restall said.
Despite the “imminent disaster,” students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final examination will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses turned out to be quite popular.
“It was complete in two hours,” Restall said of his high-level course, which consisted of 35 students.
We received emails several weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I’m fascinated to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of a class that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students questioned, and even less a teacher, told us to believe in the end date of December 21st.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,” says Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old student at Temple, who is from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I recognize that there is an apocalypse-related anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, that causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise in these speculations.
“In other parts of the world, people don’t think about it,” he said.
This is mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who gives lectures to the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew there were lectures here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception coming from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, many supposed dates of the last judgment have been discussed, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start to think about the next date" or to philosophize about the fact that December 21 will mark the beginning of a period of seven years.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several told us that they thought they were going to parties "from the end of the world".
“Sometimes I call friends and we cling to them together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
