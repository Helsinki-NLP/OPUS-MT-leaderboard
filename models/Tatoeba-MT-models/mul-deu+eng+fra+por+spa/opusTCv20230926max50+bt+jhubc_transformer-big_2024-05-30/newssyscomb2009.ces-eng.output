Right-wing populists in Austria win 29 percent
The significant weakening of both sides of the so far major coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have brought, according to the first preliminary results of Sunday’s early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People’s Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the election leader of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), Korutan hejtman Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to state-wide politics.
According to preliminary results, it remains the strongest party in the country of Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8 percent of the vote, but loses 5.5 percent of the vote against the 2006 elections.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost 25.6 percent of the vote, was even worse.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially for the people who called for early elections, a literally disastrous result.
As early as July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP stepped out of the coalition, the people in preference to the SP<0xC3><0x96> had a significant jump.
But voters were obviously punished for letting the government down.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party’s president and former Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at the party’s extraordinary chairmanship meeting.
Such developments would probably facilitate the path to the increasingly likely starting point of the election result, i.e. to the restoration of the great coalition of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Due to the reinforcement of both right-wing populist parties - the Free Party (FP<0xC3><0x96>) won 18 percent and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11 percent of the votes - however, the social democrats at the same time expressed concerns about the repetition of 1999, when the people were able to negotiate with the populists (since the time it was in the European Union) in 2005.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and expects to return to Vienna to state-wide politics.
The Green Party was still in parliament, but it lost slightly and fell between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
None of the other parties apparently exceeded the 4% threshold and did not reach parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India could cool down
If the problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who were accused of illegally collecting brooks in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg said there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it did not work out, then yes, then there would be some cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the hearing that the executive might have a hard time interfering in legal matters.
However, he said that in the case of Peter <0xC5><0xA0>váchy, who was released of charges and punished with a fine, the central government could deal with the local government in Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Kucheru, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said it would be best for him to appeal to a higher court.
He can then ask for bail and wait for the verdict to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same in the negotiations.
"He recommends appealing to a higher court, then it would be possible to have mercy on him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can enter the whole matter is to provide the convict "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance was already provided by the Indian side.
“We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relationship with India that has a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and appeal these Czech scientists,” he said.
Answers to the question of whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with matters, the minister avoided.
"I've got enough promises already," he just said.
The Czechs judge the battle for the seabed
It will access the walled electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Luigi Santosuosso, a lawyer from Italy who is a member of the 30-member UN Division of Oceans and Sea Law staff.
His head, director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, monitors and sometimes supplements the interpretation.
There will be work elan and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other infertile raw materials can be found here, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key, for example, to the development of a cure for cancer.
The ground is bigger than the ground
The coastal states have begun to vehemently approach new submarine territories today.
According to the UN Convention, they exercise their rights, which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often stretches up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
It has the exclusive right to all resources of the continental shelf under the Convention.
"Simplified, the continental shelf has that part of the seabed and its substrate, which is a natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
Saha beyond the coastal sea, often even beyond the 200 nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental shelf must be documented by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded,” Mikulka adds.
The World Report recently recorded the success of Australia, which was the first to substantially expand its undersea countries.
New Zealand, however, was also given the size of the seabed, which the Commission admitted last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the state itself.
Millions of dollars have been invested in the survey.
The profits that they will reap in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Further States will submit their applications gradually as well.
They can do this for up to ten years from the time they ratified the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, declared by the Convention as a "common heritage of humanity".
No state has any exclusive status here anymore.
The right to extraction in this area shall be conferred by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not a Klondajk," Mikulka said in a statement, stating that "its individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, according to the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, it gained the status of a so-called "pioneer investor".
It is authorized to min in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is lined up there, it's some kind of underwater replica of Tater.
"It can be mined on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev is demonstrating one such concreteness.
It resembles a small potato, or, with a little imagination, a wonderful sham, which according to legend revived Golem.
German special deployment units were involved in the liberation of hostages.
The Egyptian government has called for help from Germany in resolving the hostage crisis, experts have arrived.
When the situation was threatened, special forces were prepared, but no deployment took place.
Further details of the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are gradually being made available to the public.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue.
According to the statements of the ministries, both the experts of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German GSG9 police, the Federal Police Air Force, the Federal Criminal Office and also the logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Service (Technical Assistance Service).
However, according to a further statement from both ministries on Monday afternoon, the German forces were not needed because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of a violent release.
The Egyptian government said the aid offered by Germany was accepted as a supportive force for the action on the ground.
"Unfortunately, that didn't happen," said one of the spokesmen of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight of their Egyptian guides in southern Egypt on September 19.
After the kidnapping in the desert area of southern Egypt, hostages moved to border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last minute, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
Currently, rescues are well underway in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of the hostage was under the auspices of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, no information is yet available as to when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", all five tourists are expected to fly with special forces from one of the German Airbus aircraft and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress dropped a <0x24>700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones Index has fallen sharply.
In a 206-to-227 vote, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a government bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges faced by U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians on both sides, the majority did not find a program to alleviate chaos in financial markets.
With the dramatic event, supporters desperately tried to convince critics of the <0x24>700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called on MEPs to vote in favour, although, he said, the plan is not popular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than 6 percent, or 600 points.
Investors were worried that the state’s bailout could collapse.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose, so that after the announcement of the package's cancellation, it again declined sharply.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the approval of the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel agents are registering the increasing number of bookings
It seems that the winter will be good for German entrepreneurs in tourism:
According to one study, when booking trips for the next month increased significantly compared to the previous year – more than 30% for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the Germans’ desire to travel remains unshakable.
For bookings for the winter season, travel agencies saw a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to last year’s same period as the Deutscher Reiseverband (DRV) said on Monday in Berlin.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, there are already an increased number of reservations available for the autumn months.
According to the DRV in October, turnover was thus about 11 percent higher compared to 2007.
The basis for these results is the GfK numbers, which each month evaluates the booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies and interpolates them to the overall market.
This result included the bookings of trips that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak exchange rate of the dollar, travel to the U.S. is required primarily, the DRV said.
For these routes, the increase in bookings is about one-third.
In addition, for the Germans, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly desirable targets.
In particular, the organized tours are on course, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising energy and food expenditures, the costs are "more readable for the client than for individually organized holidays".
Laepple explained that consumers can save money, among other things, by utilizing discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was said to be very good, so a higher turnover will again be recorded compared to the previous year – although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip has fallen compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Endlessly repeated beer, beer from stews and celebrities in cuts from well-known designers.
For the first time in a beer pot.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV moderator and wears a tailor-made cut.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is from secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes off the beer pot, and we're already being shot by photographers, and we're already full of memory cards - I'm sorry, I'm at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can be friends.
Looks like my cheap cut has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the ham equator, so my sense of comfort in the ski resort was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a feminine cut or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
The special views of the banana stall in chocolate are only harvested by my coat of arms.
One nun reminds me that I misunderstood her: "You're free on the left, in the middle of the virgin, right-handed, widowed on the back."
They're hiding by shifting their feathers from the back to the left.
"Okay," he said, laughing.
Others with subtle flirting techniques do not care so much, and they have simple plastered hats with the inscription "To drank to get dressed!" and they pull on their upcoming naked ass.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is named Bob, he is from England and also came to the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He seems to be "gorgeous" with an extended "oat".
That's what he tells me after he's relieved of his just drunken mess.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are trash cans.
Bob is one of the frightened "Wildbieslers" in Bavaria, as people who urinate freely in public are called.
Others have no luck getting rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening they run around the stage where Oktoberfest is held, crowded health workers who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Doctors always appear in the hens - in the four they wear a covert carrier from tent to tent.
They work the same way as most visitors to the beer hall: empty there, full back.
Whoever lies under the bridle of this box of love is not seen.
"It's only those who can't go on," one of the doctors calls me in response to my question and disappears in the crowd.
Police have released the name of the victim of the accident.
The name of the thirty-six-year-old woman who died in the hospital after her car crashed in Essex.
Shenfield Road accident in Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, an 11-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has already been released from police bail.
Turkey’s diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began trying to join the European Union, the European powers wanted to penetrate deep into the Turkish castle.
On the eastern shore of the Bosporus, perhaps just twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in the neo-Renaissance style.
That’s what the tour guide will tell you.
The building sits at the end of the staircase with a tower at every corner through, in view of the indifference of any provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly breaking down.
But as soon as a man gets into a jeweled treasury, he can no longer doubt the size of the enterprise whose western gate was the station.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which was late in the game of empires, intended to implement its ambition to control the Middle East by means of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from the surrounding areas, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial forces marched out of Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a station as well.
In 1917, the explosion of the ammunition train destroyed its refined roof.
According to Turkish sources, it was sabotage.
Since then, she has been gradually hooked up and history has evaded her.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling party Justice and Development (AKP) has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding areas, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
Now a new policy is in place - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To review the parameters of this new policy, I took a night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I had to meet one of the leading AKP foreign policy experts, Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half an hour later - after a cruise on the rails that reminiscent of the old-world rhythms of the well-known Night Postal document, I arrived in the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for the secular state, who wants to go to its Ottoman mining.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in the paradigm of Turkish consensus.
It raised suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
The taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built on a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-detached business houses and handicrafts on the power, where the middle managers in the business clothes - shoppers, shoppers and women.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry, too.
“The goal of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its borders.
Today we have to look to the East and the West at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He had to do both.
"But surely the moment will come," I asked, "when will Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "you didn't want such a decision to happen."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke with said almost in memory: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea region are equally beneficial to Europe and the United States as Turkey is.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, take these routes to the East to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a station, after another mostly awake night, I was thinking of the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Con, who watched this building build a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found out that the European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, in large part, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting in the port for a ferry back across the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the weak man of Europe".
So it seems that at least at the time there were not many doubts which continent should be eligible for this fascinating country.
Memorable Life: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Necrologist, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district music plan, the year was founded by the excellent choir of young Proteus.
He was supposed to be under 21, but by the time Proteus sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were almost 30 - we just refused to give up that choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape changer) represented the choir's willingness and ability to engage in any music that was presented to him - be it a madrigal or a messiaen, be it alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often astounding, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanged all the time.
How often did Tod just tell us to "let the music speak for ourselves."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
Then sing it! "
His tactile technique was clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor Mayan.
No matter where the music standard was, he always raised it up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be matched to a knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by any of them – and I’ve been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, according to him, simply “took one or two dirty pecks around the world.”
Many of us will be missed.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrologist William Woodruff (September 25) claims that "in 1946 he went back to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and at the same time studied at BSc, MA and PhD."
This is based on Woodruff's author's remarks in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he completed a dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and summer 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina 'Flamenco y Vivo' because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
They reminded me of the simplicity and the powerful load with which he works on the audience, and of the respect and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
“Resino can capture magical moments.”
Honda to attack its bestseller for the second time
In November, Honda will start selling the second-generation Jazz.
If the predecessor of this one-room vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
Enhanced engines are connected to this, which increase the comfort of driving and allow for greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically speaking, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, many changes have been made to this one-room car.
It is necessary to mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period of time than other manufacturers to rejuvenate this model.
Although Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon for sale in other markets.
This is the case with Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year’s 2008.
In Japan, almost a million copies have been sold since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market became the old continent with about half a million pieces sold in six years.
Honda, however, aims to increase sales of the new Jazz in its category.
That is, while in 2007 this Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Honda Jazz pieces, in 2009 estimates 100,000 cars, which would mean a 17% increase in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the head of the Spanish branch expects 2,000 units to be sold throughout the year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
So de facto, the company expects the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007 and a 16% decrease.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
In order for Honda to achieve this share, it relies on the success of its next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a five-cylinder compact 4.37-metre-long hybrid, from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of approximately 200,000 units per year.
As for the markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will divide the old continent and Japan.
The launch of the Honda Insight is expected in the first months of next year as it will be presented to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation of the new Jazz, all dimensions have increased.
Its length increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), its width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more), and the displacement of the shafts to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
With the increase in dimensions, there has also been an increase in the interior space.
These advantages were achieved by using a new platform, but by storing a fuel tank in the middle of a car that was already used with the previous Honda Jazz.
The volume of the luggage compartment – which has a double bottom system – also increased by up to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the volume of the first-generation luggage compartment.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the 1.4 engine version, as the volume of the luggage compartment with the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
The further improvement in addition to the external elements – such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipped with a glazed panoramic roof – is easier access to the rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees versus 67 for the first Jazz.
In the second generation of the Honda Jazz, there are also new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which enables lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and delivers excellent improvements to the drive system at the same time with a high torque in the full range of engine speeds.
The first 1.2-litre engine has 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine, which had a previous generation Jazz 78 horsepower, has a consumption of 5.3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horsepower in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
The 100 horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4 has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
"Car bee" prevents collisions
To make progress in the development of accident-protection technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature, specifically bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the pattern of flying bees, thus preventing collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Technical Advancement Center have developed the robot in collaboration with the Center for Advancement in Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhira Doie, Director General of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Brand Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the four zones of Nissan’s safety shield.
The mission of the robot is to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions in cars of this brand.
During the summer, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
The most important, however, are the composite bees eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, which allows the bees to fly in their personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual function, engineers designed what they called the Laser Range Finder (Laser Range Finder).
It records obstacles up to two meters in a 180-degree radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns it into a collision warning.
"As soon as an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics bee movements and immediately changes the direction by turning the wheels at a right or even larger angle to prevent collisions.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all shifting maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If it weren’t, the robot wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move upwards and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to the direction in which it is allowed to rotate its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as with bees.
In addition to acceleration and slowdown, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent collisions.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and according to this data to be retained.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with just two dozen kB of memory.
You may be surprised, but we’re not talking about gigs or mega memory.”
This is the first step in the development of new collision prevention technologies, a technology Nissan predicts to be used in serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would bring the drivers to their destination while avoiding road obstacles.
Enjoy the fear before taking a mortgage.
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury, in addition to having enough capital to distribute injections, is not lacking in inventiveness.
Faced with a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages from banks with dubious solvency, he created on the internet a popular science game "Bad Credit Hotel".
It wasn't a bad loan hotel... or a messy hotel.
The hotel and in particular its front desk look cloudy so that a person once, twice and three times thinks about whether the right time is to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, even if not very detailed.
It is a site that is more suitable for young people than a space for the general public.
What happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel there is a dream room.
At least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its MUFG capital
The banking house Morgan Stanley announced that it will enter Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, which will issue <0x24>9 billion to earn 21 percent of its capital.
A week after unveiling their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s shares at a single price of <0x24>25.25, representing a total of <0x24>3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the accounting value of securities as of August 31.
MUFG is investing an additional <0x24>6 billion in convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and an exchange rate of <0x24>31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the entire operation would be based on an average unit price of <0x24>29, i.e. 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley's shares, however, lost 6.79 percent and fell to <0x24>23.07 around 17.00 Greenwich time.
“This strategic merger represents an important opportunity on the path to accelerating Morgan Stanley’s transition to the statute of banking holdings,” said John Mack, CEO of the U.S. group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week to allow him to diversify his activities, but at the same time put it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest ace to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms presented on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been changed over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that he would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for about <0x24>8.5 billion.
"We thought a week ago," Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, "that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimise the risks and to cover up.”
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley securities by 7% less than their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the share profit by about 20%.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares within a year if the latter are traded for a period of time at a price of 50% above the exchange price, i.e. around <0x24>47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the speakers refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new alliances.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to boast a Tier One payability ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said that since the end of August, he has "significantly" reduced his balance sheet.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, as its exchange rate has fallen by half, while insurance costs against the non-payment risk associated with debt have risen sharply.
These costs rose on Monday, but remained high, at around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of major Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced that she had picked up <0x24>15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-establishing a republic around socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third nominee submitted to the vote, following the pattern of his peers and friends, a proposal for a new constitution.
And its mission is fulfilled, because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% of the votes received the "No" vote, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, he had to get half of the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted at the exit of the polling stations and a non-governmental organization proposal predicted on Sunday a clear "yes" victory, placing them in the range of 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa, on the night of Sunday to Monday, demanded the victory of his draft constitution.
"The constitution has won the whole line," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at Guayaquil Governorate headquarters, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It is understood that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the observation mission of the Organization of States of America (OAS), took place quietly, concerned the text of the 444-point building “new socialism” promoted by the president.
The draft constitution consecrates the state’s power over the economy by preserving it of “planning the development” of a country living mainly from oil mining by foreign companies and from the currencies sent by its emigrants.
The Correa-protected proposal, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, which will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that this power will be exercised and a new mandate will be applied in February 2009.
The Constitution, among other things, establishes the principle of free health and education, which the President has begun to implement in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also counts on a ban on the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
19 hostages freed in Chad
The Egyptian command attacked the kidnappers of eleven tourists and their eight-member escort, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who had been imprisoned in the desert for ten days, were taken alive and well to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
During the morning, an Egyptian command was released in Chad.
The hostages arrived around 15:30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft at al-Maza military base, close to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported, without the possibility of expressing themselves in the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, Cairo’s outskirts of residence, to undergo medical examinations there.
"They are completely healthy" and "the contractors have not been paid any ransoms," said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zohejr Garran on the route of the airport.
Since its capture on September 19, during a safari in a four-wheeled vehicle at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a hostage group has been dragged from one hiding place to the other by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one frontier director of Aegyptous, the organizer of the safari.
A senior security officer in Egypt said 30 members of the special forces who were approaching the site on board two helicopters had crashed into the barracks during the night just before dawn.
“There was a shooting, half of the kidnappers were killed and the rest fled,” said the source, who wanted to remain anonymous.
He pointed out that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the Flash unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, mentioned the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the people from our secret services, from the special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
In the evening, the Sudanese army said it had stopped a vehicle with all four-wheel drive on board of the hijackers, killing six of them, including a Chad commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed to have been linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the said movement immediately rejected.
Letters - Quiet most of the cultural resort
The debate on the financing of culture fills the page with newspaper headlines and is the topic of the current election campaign.
Better time.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to clean up the poor sums that are provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national monuments that spark hunger?
What politicians will be happy to remind the federal government that they will forget their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we don’t have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to the restoration of the mere castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
It is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organizations, in cooperation.
In Québec, in the federation of Quebec History Society, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered into 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy about the disclosure of history, the preservation of a pile of private archives and the protection of archaeological remains for a few.
Often these companies are the watchdogs of our memorials, who are desperately protesting when promoters and executives throw their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally reach the Tribune for History and Monuments?
Government of Benelux State Bank Fortis
The states of Benelux will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the widespread effect of the US mortgage market crisis, by partial nationalisation: the three countries will support the monetary and insurance institutions, the shareholding of the 11 billion e-capital
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed at the highest level this weekend with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Banka Fortis is the first in the euro area to go into a major crisis in the context of the crisis of international financial markets, which has spread in waves for more than a year, and the decisions taken in this regard could in some way be seen as precedents.
In terms of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets there.
The bank will with absolute certainty sell some of its equity shares, especially then - mainly insurance - the assets purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis’s shares began to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week there were serious signs of a crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it collapse.
The company's securities fell only 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year minimum.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company’s executives, this is unrealistic.
The company’s management is blamed for the decline in Fortis’s overseas market share of uncertainty related to the adoption of a <0x24>700 billion U.S. package plan.
On Monday, the stocks had risen slightly.
On Friday, the new Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, Filip Dierckx, was appointed.
The monetary institution was also looking for private buyers, however, with a more serious offer, no one has yet signed up.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors do not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
There was no panic among the bank’s clients and the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis Bank has a separate branch and has also acquired several leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken
Life and health insurance companies in the United States, based on people’s data on the purchase of medicines, often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with the applicant.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that binds the use of prescription data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of an independent person, otherwise we entrust the chicken fox," quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, author of a program designed to monitor prescription drugs.
The insurance company makes the insurance and the amounts paid in the case of insurance events depending on the health status of the interested party, and if the risk is assessed as too high, it does not even cover the insurance with it.
In the past, they sent the person concerned for medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number of the pharmacist, the customer will easily find out what medications he has purchased in the last year and a half, from which the program itself results, how he suffers from the disease, and what his state of health is.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol-lowering medications, it refers to the fact that it has practically uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts it in the higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation right away, some at the same time as determining the risk factor, so there is almost no work left in the insurance company besides paperwork, even though small problems arise.
Disadvantages include that certain medicines can also be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds are useful against migraines or fever attacks, but they are also effective against depression.
These represent a significant risk-increasing factor from the point of view of commercial insurers, where the above-mentioned problems are not.
For the purpose of requesting and processing the data, special companies have been created, which, before providing the necessary information from the pharmacist, ask the patient for permission.
They are now being forced by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their negligence so far.
Some companies have also recently been working on the results of laboratory tests that relate to the data on the medicines they are taking, allowing them to provide an even more accurate picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, while controlling their use will become more and more complex.
There is a special health data protection law, however, its effectiveness applies only to healthcare providers and insurers.
The bill, which gives authorities the power to control companies specializing in the provision of data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: that is why he developed his program so that the transfer of data is bound by the explicit consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that the authorization in question can hardly be denied, otherwise the insurance companies will not enter into a contract with it.
So the blinds are only slightly referenced to the fox of good will.
The Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India to double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this topic has also led to the agenda of the ninth summit, in addition to other, predominantly global issues.
The French-Indian summit will also take place today, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is developing with a democratic power, which should be given a greater opportunity to speak on international affairs, but the Member States have not yet managed to find a common denominator on the issue of support for permanent membership in New Delhi.
This issue has not yet been dealt with at the 9th summit, which was held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as the current President of the Union, the President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed that the turnover of trade would not be more than five billion years, doubled or doubled.
Given that the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
As a sign of this, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been legally agreed, so that the future of aviation is green.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy said the negotiations would be accelerated.
The goal is to balance the balance sheet, while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is among the EU’s partners up to ninth.
The summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, respectively, have condemned both sides in all their forms and called for an accelerated UN conference to be convened.
They also called for the end of the round of trade talks in Dauha, although both have a large share in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will continue on its energy and climate programme, namely that it would like to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as well as with the need to conclude a global agreement at the next year’s climate conference and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent rising food prices and support the convening of an international conference to address the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India is heading to the French capital, where he plans to close a trade deal on the peaceful use of nuclear power at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion in commissions to build Indian nuclear reactors will be given to French companies.
According to the Agency’s reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Large participation of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will participate in the 60th Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects this edition of more than 7,000 exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries, who will take 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to be seen as a turque.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inaugural ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – at 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a press meeting at Room Structure Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the total Italian production is decreasing, mainly due to literature for children and adults.
Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The remains of the plane were found by Steve Fosset, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the desert in Nevada.
The fragments were discovered on a hilly plain at an altitude of three thousand meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, raised the doubts that remained: “The plane was found, we sent a team there and now we’re sure it’s exactly where Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared,” he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been deemed dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (NTSB) said several hours after detecting the damage, it was sent by an inquiry team that eventually identified the aircraft: it is exactly the Bellanca 8kcab, uninformed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett flew off from the Yerevan airport.
Yesterday, still in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal items were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, about cash and one coat.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has won a place in history thanks to a long collection of championships.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a journey around the world in an air balloon: a two-week flight alone.
Three years later, the world flew around in an airplane without landing.
His many records include a flight at an altitude of 15,445 meters, above the Andes, although with a copilot.
Advertising that you don’t expect
An unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "compact" jeeps of the starhouse, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring the newest lines into this sector.
It is precisely thanks to its unconventional processing that it will be an unexpected and unconventional communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk and that will be available in the showrooms of Mercedes-Benz from October 17.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, also launches an unofficial way of communication thanks to the futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is also used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The Maxi Posters project, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan business class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and with the help of special glasses, which will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Actually, when you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its small sizes, so that it can then reassemble in a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communications.
Will he succeed in arousing the interest of future customers in this way? We will see.
So we know who the Italians are.
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of Italy? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the Nazionale azzurra for years and, to be honest, has never done too much trouble.
She never met an opponent’s fans.
The orientation of the group is right.
The founders are from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Terst and Udine.
In Sofia, they were joined by groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-colored flags showing the cities of origin of the participants: on Saturday night they were removed so that they could not be recognized.
Inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all for the name, that is, easy to control.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dash, no one to be banned from visiting the stadiums.
The four blue fans who had previously had violations from the stadium were denied a ticket and the match was banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports coming from the Bulgarian police, then will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified during the raid.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our Chuligans, in short, will no longer enter a single stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: this means that more than one hundred and fifty are added.
“We must immediately end this fire and not justify those who behave in this way,” Viminalu said.
So, "decently open eyes, mainly because of the national match on Wednesday in Lecce."
Right in Puglia, there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio will meet on Tuesday, Casms, which can also count on one part of Aise, a secret service that takes care of problems at the stadiums.
"Religious Leader-Leader and tense arm during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria it's not a crime...".
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really unlucky way), who for a few weeks was the director of the Viminal Observatory (he gained a place that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was once a quasar in Terst, where the core of Ultras Italia supporters was founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate a leader, but of course, the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a shame.
“I’m not a sociologist – adds Observatory One – the crimes are attributed to the country where they happened.
So far this group has remained within the limits, now let’s take a look at what has happened and evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the rise of Mameli’s hymn: it’s not a crime either, but if you allow it, it’s disobedience.
