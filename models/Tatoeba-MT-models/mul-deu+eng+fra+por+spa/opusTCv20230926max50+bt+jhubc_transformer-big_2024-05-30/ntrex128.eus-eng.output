Members of the Welsh Assembly have expressed their concerns 'because they will take them as twins'
A number of members of the Assembly have expressed discomfort after hearing suggestions to change their name as MWP (Member of the Legislative Assembly).
This idea came into being after plans to change the name of the Legislative Assembly of Galicia were developed.
The members of the political assembly are concerned that this is a good way to laugh at them.
A member of the Labour Party at the meeting said: "This new name spells out Twp and Pwp in English."
If you are outside of Wales: In English, the word twp means "innocent" and the word pwp means "cake".
For his part, a member of the Scottish parliament has said the entire group is "not very happy" and has suggested looking for a replacement name.
Also, a Conservative member of the Welsh party has said that there is an "evil" for new ideas to change the name, but has also expressed concerns about the implications that MWP could bring about changes.
In order to better understand this problem, it is necessary to take into account that the Welsh w letters and the Yorkshire English u letters have a similar pronunciation.
On the other hand, the committee of the Assembly, which is creating a legal barrier to amendment of names, said: "As far as members of the Assembly are concerned, they will have the sole responsibility to select the descriptors they wish to use."
According to the Galician government's 2017 act, the Galician Assembly has the ability to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation to select the proposed proposals and, in general, the Galician Legislature received numerous declarations of solidarity.
As for the names of the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name of the Member of the Legislative Assembly of Wales or WMP (in English acronyms), but the name MWP was decided in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly, on the other hand, suggest alternatives, but it can be extremely difficult to choose an option by mouth; especially for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who has had to send out a few weeks of discussion with the changes.
However, the legislative amendments to be made will affect the functioning of the Assembly; among other things, rules will be established to avoid activities that would result in the loss of good name to members of the Assembly and the design of the system of the Assembly will be managed with the help of this law.
When discussing the amendment of the legislation, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to decide on their names.
Macedonians will take part in a referendum to change the country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday and decide whether or not to change the country's name under the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
This referendum was organised in order to resolve the long-term issue of the last decades with Greece (which is called a province called Macedonia).
The government of Athens has long underlined the name of its northern neighbour because of a re-indication of its territory and has repeatedly prevented the request for entry into the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite to change his name, has said he will not see the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum (including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev), say it is only the price to be paid for entering the U.S. and NATO.
San Martín Church camps lose their voice because of problems with Harlem churches
"I've talked to a lot of older people and they've been telling me that you could find a bar and a church in all the old days," Adams said.
Nowadays, there’s nothing.”
He says the disappearance of the bar is normal.
“People use other methods to socialize,” he explains.
“The bars are no longer the rooms that people used to meet.”
As for the elites, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of assets will not be enough and "we will be back at the starting point sooner or later".
Similarly, churches can be replaced by houses, and people who do not care about the shrines of the neighbourhood will build proprieties filled with them.
"The people who buy houses of ownership will be white people," he says, "and that's why the churches will be closed alive because these new people are not members of the congregations of the churches."
The congregations of white people built two churches before Harlem was a black metropolis; it was the Metropolitan community of 1870 and San Martin was built a decade later.
In 1930, the original Methodist Congregation left the neighborhood.
After that, a black congregation of people took the relay.
Reverend John Howard Johnson's Black Congregation took San Martin Church; Howard organized a boycott against 125 Harlem Street shopping malls, which did not hire or raise black people.
As a result of a fire in 1939, the church suffered a number of damages, but Father Johnson's church members devised a number of plans to rebuild the church and collect the chapel.
Reverend David Johnson, father of Johnson's son and heir to San Martin, called the carillon "the camps of the poor people."
In July, the expert who hit the carillon gave him another name: "The Treasure of Culture" and "the irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, has also stated that he was the first black musician to be played in the world; the musician, Dionisio A. Linde, went to play the larger church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather explains that San Martin has not replaced his musician.
In recent months, San Martin has witnessed the tireless arrivals of several architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by lay leaders or bishop dioceses.
The parish assembly (the council of archaeology composed of lay leaders), on the other hand, sent a letter to the diocese in July to verify that the contracts of these persons "will pass to the parish the costs incurred" because the parish has nothing to do with the diocese's sending counterparts.
Some churches have lodged complaints about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was injured when he was looking for oysters on the California coast.
According to police, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured on Saturday while searching for oysters on the California coast on the first day of the oyster harvest.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. on the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
According to the San Diego KSWB-TV channel, Chad Hammele was swimming with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning, but his friend, screaming, heard a call for help; then, he swims with a group of people to help him out of the water.
Hammel, who had found an oyster friend, thought he was screaming happily alive first, but then realized that his friend was screaming "I'm fucked!"
I've been kicked!
"I could see his entire club," said Hammel, after seeing his friend.
"I cried out to all the people out of the water, 'There's a curse!'" said Hammel.
The San Diego Rady has been taken to a children's hospital and his condition is severe.
Couldn't find the species of squirrel that attacked in this election.
Sorosle's captain, Larry Giles, presented a report to the media and said they had seen a swamp a few weeks earlier, but the species was not determined to be dangerous.
Giles also said the victim's wounds are on top of the sound.
Police have shut down access to Encinitas’ Swami beach from Casablade’s Ponto beach to conduct a 48-hour investigation to ensure the safety of the people.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 species of seaweed in the area, but most are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's supermarket plans to enter the UK cosmetic market
Sainsbury's supermarket has operated in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores and now offers beauty salons in the style of large shops with a range of experts and specialists.
While the sales of fashion and household products are declining, <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion has been invested in the UK’s beauty sector, which is growing indefinitely; it will build more beauty shops and will be tested in the country’s 11 stores, if the results are close.
Thanks to the investments made in the field of beauty, televisions, microwaves and shops selling home products can benefit from supermarkets.
According to Sainsbury's supermarkets, their beauty products will double and offer more than 3000 products; also, Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw and similar brands will be put at the disposal of customers.
As for L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands, they will have more space in marked areas, like those found in Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket is re-introducing its "Boutique" branded makeup, which is entirely a beige product; younger retailers are increasingly demanding such products.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test out the offers offered by land sellers at Sainsbury's two supermarket stores; the first opened in Croydon (south London) last week and the second, Selly Oaken (Birmingham), will open again at the end of the year.
Online shopping and the daily tendency to buy food in small local stores are the reason why supermarkets have to work head and ear to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's supermarkets, said that retail outlets will adopt the style of large stores and that supermarket chains will reduce the threat of Aldi and Lidl competitors to non-food products.
Sainsbury's supermarket has opened Argos stores in hundreds of stores and opened several Habitats, two chains two years ago, which is why food sales have strengthened and the chains purchased are more profitable than ever.
The supermarket tried to reopen the beauty and pharmacy department, but the strategy failed.
He then merged with Sainsbury's Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger ended because the process of dividing the profits in supermarket pharmacy became paper burning.
A new strategy was set up when Sainsbury's supermarket sold its 281 stores of pharmacy to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds chain will have a function in the organized plan: it will add a large range of luxury skincare brands in four stores; among others, La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s supermarkets, said: “We have improved the look of beauty salons so that our customers can find the best environments.
In addition, we have recruited highly experienced workers to provide specific advice on the products.
We have designed our brand range to meet all your demands and, thanks to the convenient environment and location, our beauty salons offer a modern and easy option in front of shops that use outdated methods."
Pete Jones is "enraged" by Holly Willoughby after dropping a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million offer.
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones was "enraged" by Holly Willoughby's end-of-life deal with the brand's 11 million-liberal deal after he dropped his contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for the True brand that sells home products and ingredients.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
Presenter of This Morning, 37, used Instagram to present his resignation.
Following Holly Willoughby's resignation to accept the contracts offered by Marks & Spencer and ITV companies, "Dragons" show star Peter Jones was horribly angry at the late end of the high-profit business created between the two.
According to our sources, there was a tragic meeting at Marlowe's headquarters on Tuesday and, as a result, Jones was "horriblely angry" when he heard the famous woman on our television explaining that she would accept <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million in new contracts, and that she would not be able to accept them.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and has doubled Willoughby's 11 million pound worth.
Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving the True brand's business to go to a vacation home that Jones left the UK.
One source said: “Holly’s priorities have always been that opportunity.
Thanks to this decision, the future of the next two decades will be guaranteed.
However, the decision to leave the mark has left our mouth full of teeth.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, even when the brand’s offer was closed.
Moreover, the warehouse of Marlowe’s headquarters is filled with products to be sold.”
According to experts, the company is struggling to lose millions of pounds due to the departure of the presenter for the This Morning program (which is the UK's most profitable presenter); the company has invested a lot of money in a variety of products (e.g., made of cupcakes, candles, clothing, and home appliances, etc.)
In addition, this may be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin have three children and Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, have been friends for ten years.
Willoughby and Cappe founded the True brand in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as director in March.
The two couples always organize their holidays together, and Jones has 40 percent of Baldwin's television production.
Willoughby will be M&S's ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source from the Jones group said in a statement that he "would not say anything about the activities of his business."
The conversation was late, yes, but then "we fell in love"
He was joking about the wrong words he had to bear on the media, all for making a "inappropriate" comment about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give so much?
Trump has used his "television presenter" voice to answer in chats:
"I didn't give anything."
Following the first meeting in Singapore in June, President Trump said he wanted to hold a second meeting and, thanks to that, has taken a very important step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, the process of nuclear disarmament has stopped.
After a meeting in Singapore in June and three months, North Korea’s chief diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told UN World Leaders: At the general meeting on Saturday, North Korea has not seen “appropriate responses” to the U.S. military in the United States.
Instead, the sanctions imposed by the United States have been tightened to keep the country under pressure.
Trump, on the other hand, has a broader view and has expressed that in the last speech.
"The relationship we have with North Korea is better than ever," he said.
"Also, we were declaring war with North Korea".
Millions of people could die in this war.
But now, we have this special relationship in our hands.”
In addition, he said efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought good results; among other things, tests with missiles have ended, the process of release of prisoners has improved, and the rest of the U.S. military is delaying.
He also explains his unusual point of view regarding the conversations he had with Kim.
"It's terribly easy to do the president's job, but if there are 10,000 people who want to enter the country forcefully, we have 200 people here," Trump said in a statement.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia have destroyed an island and killed hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, there was no need for the help of non-profit organizations to win internationally.
Although 10 percent of Lombok’s population was displaced, the earthquake was not declared a national disaster (a prerequisite for requesting assistance from nations).
"In many cases, unfortunately, the government clearly stated that it did not need international assistance, so this situation is a challenge," Sumung said.
The Save the Children organization is forming a team that will go to Palura, but it is not yet known whether volunteers can work in the country.
Mr. Sutopo, representatives of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials are working on Palun to accept assistance from international agencies.
Although Indonesia has suffered a number of earthquakes, the country has undertaken measures to deal with natural disasters.
Anti-tsunami fortresses have been built in Aceh, but there are still few fortresses on the coast.
Palu does not have a siren to warn people, and even though he was on the alert, perhaps that's why he was so dead.
When the weather is good, travelling between Indonesian islands can be a challenge.
In addition, natural disasters make it difficult to implement logistics.
A hospital ship was anchored in Lombok to provide treatment to the victims of the earthquake and is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the point of disaster.
The campaign of President Joko Widodo was based on projects to improve Indonesian infrastructure and has invested a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, the funds have been reduced and the administration of the Games president is in a tight position as the next year's elections are being prepared.
Similarly, Mr. Joko has trouble controlling the tyranny of Indonesian sects; for example, most members of the Islamic party have taken a more conservative view of religion.
As a result, more than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands of their homes have been lost because gangs of Christians and Muslims have taken their fighters to the streets; among others, they use rifles, bows, rifles and similar weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge's Equal-Goal vs. Chelsea
On Saturday, thanks to the goal scored by Daniel Sturridge at London's Stamford Bridge in the 89th minute, Liverpool survived the Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Thanks to the Chealsea pass from Xherdan Shaqirik from 30 yards, Sturridge was able to change the marker 1-0.
He put the ball on his left before he hit the doorpost.
Thanks to this stitching, the ball flew to the area where the ball flew and went to the top-right of the net.
Eventually, the ball overcame the protection of Kepa Arrizabalagar and entered the net.
"As players like Shaq are always playing at the top, I wanted to get that position so I could get the ball, so I tried to get enough time," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the song coming and, with a single touch, I was standing on the ball; after that I didn't have much time to think; I just took the opportunity."
Belgian star Eden Hazard, who scored a goal in the 25th minute, was scoring Chelsea 1-0 in the middle of the game.
During that game, the blue team's frontman returned an orpox pass to Mateo Kovacici, who returned in the middle of the field and ran to the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic was fishing in the middle of the field.
Then he gave the ball a great deal of money, which was at the foot of Hazard.
Hazard overtook the other team's defense and put the ball in the net behind the door with a left foot injury that destroyed Liverpool's Alison Becker's defense.
Liverpool's next match will be against Naples in the Champions League team phase at 15:00 p.m. on Wednesday, at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
On the other hand, Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday in London.
Indonesia's Tsunami Death toll rises to 832
Indonesia's earthquakes and tsunami have raised the death toll to 832, according to the disaster agency on Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesman said several people were trapped in the building's debris after a 7.5-degree earthquake and 20-foot-high tides hit Friday.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was filled with the debris of the buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man for Attacking and Murdering Woman
A murder investigation was launched this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead.
The body of the 44-year-old woman was found wounded at 7.55 a.m. in John Grayson Mews Street; currently, a 32-year-old man has been arrested as the main suspect in the murder.
The police have asked the people of the neighborhood if they have seen or heard anything, to call the police.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is only the beginning, but if someone has seen or heard anything on John Street in Birkenhead, we'd love to contact us.
We also want to ask for help from the drivers of cars that can make recordings, including other taxi drivers, because they may have the necessary information recorded for research."
On the other hand, a police official confirmed that the woman found was living in Birkenhead and her body was found inside a house.
That afternoon, a number of friends who knew the woman arrived at the scene of the incident in the morning to find out where the body was.
As the investigation continues, the police will contact the victim’s family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but police said no one could enter or exit the building.
After hearing about what happened, he was shocked.
Neighbors will have to wait a few hours to get into their homes.
A policeman was talking to a neighbourhood and was stating that the entire area would be taken as the scene of the murder.
Later, a woman appeared in the room crying.
He said again and again, “This is scary.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police patrol cars entered the police line and another patrol remained outside.
Several police officers have searched the building's apartments.
Anyone with the information can send a message to DM <0x40>MerPolCC account, call 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers' phone number (0800 555 111); except for the September 30th 247th registration.
Parliament's Cromwell Statue becomes the ultimate goal of "renewing history" trend
If it disappears, it will be poetic justice: in the same way that the Taliban destroyed several religious objects, the Puritans of England did the same thing with various historical and cultural objects in the country.
The Cromwell Society, however, says that Mr. Crick's suggestion is a "walllessness" and is "trying to renew history."
John Goldsmith, a representative of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's debate about the abolition of the state outside Westminster Palace has become an objective.
Cromwell himself never claimed or organized the iconoclasms of the English Civil War.
Perhaps we should sacrifice another Cromwell for the actions of his ancestors, Thomas, in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's stunning depiction of Cromwell is part of the 19th century opinions and our historiography; many still believe that the actions of this person should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Less people than in the 19th century believe this, yes, but many still believe that Cromwell was a defender of the parliament against external pressures; in this case, of course, we are talking about the monarchy.
It will continue to be a mammoth of historical debates whether or not this person’s image is accurate.
However, we can safely say that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century was the starting point for the development of our country, and the famous Cromwell was part of the parties that took part in that starting point.
The title "Lord Protector" may also be a reason to celebrate and remember all the achievements they have won."
A Pig Kills a Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
A man named "Yuan" was found dead, with a cut artery in his body and a blood clot in a pork at the Liupanshu market in Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post newspaper.
On May 30, 2005, a pig breeder prepares for the introduction of pigs in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Usually on Wednesdays, she travels from Yunnan province with her cousin to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the body of the deceased and saw the door of the pighouse next door open.
He also indicated that there was a large pig's blood in his mouth.
The court's analysis report confirms that the <0xC2><0xA3>550 pig was killed by a farmer.
"My cousin's legs were full of blood and bleached," his cousin, who was nicknamed "Wu", told Guiyang Evening News.
According to security camera footage, Yuan can be seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. (Thursday) to feed pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not one of Yuan’s or of his cousin’s wrists.
A market chief told the Evening News newspaper that the pig is locked up to prevent further attacks and allow the police to collect evidence of the site.
Yuan’s family and market leaders are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although strange, the attacks of some pigs have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a Massachusetts basin, and the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig surrounded a Welsh farmer in his tractor, until the man’s wife was bitten by the animal.
In 2012, a farmer’s pigs in Oregon ate their bodies and, after that, a farmer in Manitoba left CBC News that pigs weren’t vulnerable animals, but if they tasted blood, it could function as a “factor.”
"They love to play.
They're like children, and they're very knowledgeable, they don't want to hurt you.
“You have to show respect,” he said.
Small Hurricane Roses Leaving Rainfall in U.S. Southwest
According to the weather, the hurricane Rosa is weakening as it flows into the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rainstorms to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At 5:00 a.m., Rosa will generate 85-mile-hour winds and become a Category 1 hurricane. According to the Eastern Time, on Sunday, it was found at 385-mile from Punta Eugenia in southwestern Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will head north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low-pressure point is being created in the Lower Ocean and it will head east to the western coast of the United States. On Monday, it will go to the Rosa Baja California Peninsula, a tropical rainfall that will take it from the north to the United States.
In addition, on Monday, Rosa will bring about 10 percent rainfall in some parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, tropical fertility will be combined with a low-precision point and large rainfall will be generated in the south-west in the coming days.
In local areas, 1-4 percent of the water can be hazardous, because sudden floods, waste streams and landslides can occur in the desert.
Rains caused by high tropical precipitation can leave 2-3 hectares of water at specific times and locations, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to collect 2-4 percent of the water in the southwest, especially in Arizona.
Because tropical rains are sideways, they can cause sudden rains and flooding conditions.
It is not advisable to go for a walk in the desert if the warning of a tropical rainfall has been given.
Rainstorms can turn rocks into rivers, and rains can bring wind and dust from the wind.
In addition, as pressure drops, there will be local rainstorms on the southern coast of California.
Due to rain and a half-hectare of water, small streams of waste and dirty roads may be created.
This could be the first rainy season in the region.
Also, on Sundays and Mondays, some tropical rains may arise in Arizona, but there will be more rainfall on Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the rainbows will go to the four corners and will expire until Wednesday.
October may have severe temperature changes in the U.S. to the extent that the territorial areas are cold, but the warm temperatures of the tropics will be maintained.
Sometimes, these temperatures are subject to major changes in distances.
As an example, there will be major temperature changes in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
There is a nearly 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will reach and will spread everywhere.
The U.S. central and eastern regions will be warm, with temperatures of 80 degrees from the south to the northeast.
It can also be 80 degrees Celsius on Tuesdays in New York City; it can be slightly over 10 degrees Celsius on average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, the east of the United States will receive temperatures greater than average in the first quarter of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's statement.
More than 20 million people saw the shocking statements of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford in Tuesday's sixth channel news, the latter accusing Kavanaugh of sexual abuse in 1980.
Meanwhile, the political controversy continued and the channel's broadcasters stopped Friday's permanent programming to give a last-minute news: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake agreed to conduct a week-long investigation with the FBI.
According to a statement to the Senate magistrate, it is quite certain that Kavanaugh had touched him over and over while he was drunk and tried to take off his clothes at a university party.
For Kavanaugh, he said in a fiery statement that it was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen data, nearly 20.4 million people saw the statement on Friday.
The company calculated the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
However, that number was not immediately usable for other channels, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who watch TV in offices.
For example, we can say that the number of spectators can be compared with a football final or with Academy awards.
According to Fox News Channel, Kavanaugh’s statement is fully accepted by the channel’s presenters and an average of 5.69 million viewers while making the statement, Nielsen said.
The second ABC was 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After hearing the statement, the public’s interest remained.
Flake was the cornerstone of Friday's drama.
After announcing that the Republican moderate office would vote for Kavanaugh, cameras on CNN and CBS channels recorded Kavanaugh on Friday as he was trying to take a manifesto-enclosed elevator to declare in the judiciary.
On the CNN channel, he was seen watching the protesters beating down.
"I'm here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?"
And he added, "You have amazing powers, but many women don't have anything."
At that moment and before the elevator door closed, Flake said that his office had published a notice and would give more details at the meeting.
Cable and television channels were broadcasting live for hours and, in the meantime, the Magistrate Assembly was voting on the appointment of Senator Kavanaugh.
However, Flake said he would vote on the FBI's arguments against the candidate for a week, and at least remember that he was asking the Democratic party to do so.
After talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coon, Flake believed almost entirely in the investigation.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made his final decision.
Flaken's decision was powerful, because the Republican party did not need enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to examine the arguments against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “playing with politics” as the basis for Brexit
According to a Sunday Times interview, Prime Minister Theresa May blames people who are criticizing her plans to leave the European Union for playing with the UK’s future and weakening the country’s interests.
On September 29, 2018, Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative party's speech to be held in Birmingham.
In another interview on the newspaper's front page, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized a plan called a "lady-game" for Brexit and said the taxes to be paid by Britain and the European Union were "totally ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson for murder of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspected person for the death of Wayde Simsen, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU University.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Police have shared a video of the discussion between Sims and Simpson and, according to police, Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
According to CBS WAFB partner, police have recovered these glasses from the scene of the murder and said they were in Simpson's DNA.
After asking Simpson, he confessed to giving Wayder a shot.
His lawyer said his fiduciary is set at <0x24>350,000.
The Eastern Baton Rouge district court office published a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a shot from head to toe.
The department is grateful to the Department for helping the Department of State Police find fugitives, the State Police Criminology Laboratory, the Southern University police and the surrounding citizens in their search for suspects.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanked police for "the prestige and the protection of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
Two-metre player Baton Rouge grew up and his father Wayne also played in baseball at LSU.
He scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds on average in last season games.
On Friday morning, LSU baseball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayden's death.
"These are things that always bother you," Wade said.
A mob throws fires in Mexico City.
Rainfall caused by the Popocatepetl volcanoes has reached the southern parts of Mexico City.
The pre-disaster National Center warned Mexicans on Saturday and recommended that the crater stay away from the volcano after several activities; 183 gas and debris surges were recorded for 24 hours.
Half of the summit also had several darts.
According to social media images, wild boars can be seen in the winds of cars in some neighborhoods of Mexico City (e.g., Xochimilcon).
Geophysicists have found that the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, has increased since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in September 2017 struck Mexico's middle.
"Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The struggle between the police and the independents of Catalonia before the anniversary of voting for independence
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona on Saturday to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia’s independence vote in Catalonia as thousands of people joined the opposition police for fighting against the trends.
The anti-Istalian police stopped a mobbed independentist group, but they were thrown away with eggs and paints; as a result, dusty streets filled with tourists were created.
Later, more struggles arose because the police were using their guns to stop the leaks.
Similarly, the bands in favor of independence have been walking for several hours before the unions singing "We will not forget, we will not forgive" who were singing "Large Life to Spain."
According to local journalists, 14 people were treated for the minor injuries sustained in the leaks.
There is great anxiety in this territory which seeks to find independence after the elections on 1 October, which were illegal according to the Madrid government, but achieved a day to celebrate the independence of Catalonia.
Most of the voters voted for independence, but the participation of citizens was very small due to the number of citizens who wanted to boycott the elections against independence.
According to Catalan authorities, after the attack by the 1,000 wounded police, voters went to the polling stations to stop the voters, which is why violent clashes were created.
Independence groups have camped on Friday to avoid a national police demonstration.
The demonstration took place, but they were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician and went to the independence demonstration with his wife, saying that Catalonia no longer hopes for independence.
“We had a wonderful memory last night.
"My parents were happy to vote because they could have voted for joy, but now we're bored," he said.
After achieving a pivotal but important victory in the local elections last December, Catalan independence parties have had a lot of trouble this year to maintain the interests of the people; some of the parties have been detained or held overseas by prosecution and organising a referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, is recording a protest in favour of the police on his phone and says politicians from both sides are guilty of the situation.
"There's more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, one of the leaders of Catalonia, Oriol Junqueras, who has been waiting for a trial in prison since last year, said he would take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
"If I participate as a candidate in the European elections, the best way to denounce the reduction of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Three men arrested for hitting a house in a car
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, have been arrested for hitting a Londonderry house in a car over and over again.
The incident at Ballyngard Crescent was at 19:30 (BST) on Tuesday afternoon.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the building and its doors were damaged.
It also appears to have been used in the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 against the Rangers thanks to Mengar's goalkeeper
Dolly Mengar's First Goal Reveals Livingston's Victory
Livingston has shocked Rangers player and Steven Gerrard scores his second loss in 18 matches as Ibrox club leader.
Dolly Menga's throw was decisive for Gary Holten's Hibernian team to rise in the second half.
Gerrarden's team is left unsuccessful this Premiership season and will have to play against the Hearts leaders (who have eight more points) next Sunday.
Before that match, the Rangers will have to play with Rapid Vienna on Tuesday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, the Livingston team is unsuccessful and six games remain this season; Holt's coach hasn't figured out what's going on since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses a lot of opportunities in front of strong visitors
Holten's team had to take a step forward before entering the goal; as he was extremely straightforward, he caused a number of problems to the Rangers' team.
Scott Robinson made his way but all his efforts were lost in front of the door and then Alan Lithgow redirected his efforts to the rear after the head of Craig Halkett.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play, but they knew that the visitors could have fun at any time.
And with that, the goal was decisive.
The Rangers gave a free throw and Livingston created an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to mark Menga, but the latter knocked the ball into the middle of the goal.
During this phase of the game, the Rangers dominated the property, but the home defense was intransigent and Liam Kelly's goalkeeper spent the game smoothly.
This pattern continued until the middle of the second part, but the dismissal of Alfredo Morelos demanded Kelly's full skill.
Scott Pittman could not score because of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgowe avoided another game at Livingston.
The walks went into the Livingston area over and over and over again; the home players were asked for two penalties for challenging representative Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with their hand, but both were rejected.
Livingston's match "combinant" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston's game was unique and the result was unbeatable.
For me, they have done great games and they have great chances of getting to the level.
The style of the players and the team hasn't changed since they reached the first level, but Holt has been an outstanding coach: since he arrived, he has put the team on the right track.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett's work has been terrifying; he has organized and managed an unparalleled defense, and Menga has been responsible for putting Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall nervous throughout the game.
The Rangers didn’t have much inspiration, though.
They work very well at Gerrard's orders, but they have forgotten the standards set by the coaches.
The final game has been weak and they have only won the defense of the houses once; the Rangers have to run quickly if they want to get out of the table.
Erdogan finds anti-colonial welcome in Cologne
Smiles and blue skies were on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met to have breakfast in Berlin.
President Erdogan is the last day of the controversial visit to Germany; the visit was organized to resolve relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed a number of issues, including the lack of human rights and press freedom and Turkey’s access to the European Union.
Afterwards, Erdogan went to Colonia to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest population outside of Turkey.
Because of the security measures imposed by the police, 25,000 people who wanted to gather in front of the mosque were blocked, but several followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (mostly Kurds) gathered their voices together to protest Erdogan’s policy measures and the German government’s decision to welcome the president.
Protesters on both sides reflected the discrepancies sparked by the Lehendakari; some Turks in Germany say he is a hero and others say he is just an autocrat.
Deptford Road Accident: A Cyclist Killed In A Car Crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred in the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets at about 10:15 a.m.; the Deptford highway in the southeast of the city is usually overtaken by car.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived immediately, but the man died on the spot.
In Childers Street, one mile from the accident on Saturday, another cyclist died a month ago and the driver escaped.
Metropolitan Police are working to identify the man and alert his family.
A number of roads have been closed and the permanent route of bus lines has changed; motorists are also advised to avoid that area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in a Crash
Six prison officers have been injured in a man's high-security prison, the prison office said in a statement.
HMP Long Lartin jail in Worcestershire was opened at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday morning (BST) and the sessions have not yet been completed.
Officials of "Tornado" have arrived to end the detention of eight detainees; for the time being, it has been confined to a wing of the building.
Officers had small injuries to their face and healed them there.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "We have sent experts to the prison to end HMP Long Lartin's sentences.
We've healed six workers from the injuries they've sustained.
"We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we will hand those who have started the riots over to the police, and I am sure they will spend much more time between the prison barracks."
The HMP Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 detainees, including the country's criminal rape.
In June, the mayor of the prison had to go to the hospital for an attack by a detainee.
In addition, in October last year, counter-terrorism officers had to go to jail to stop a serious lice, as the detainees were attacking workers with bills of masks.
Hurricane Rosa has become a threat to the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (possibly taking advantage of some of the driest areas)
It is very strange to see a tropical rainfall in Arizona, but the same will happen next week as the Rosa rains deplete its power; she will visit the southwestern desert and there is a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already sent a warning about the sudden rains that may occur on Monday and Friday; it will enter from the western part of Arizona and will go south and east of Nevada. Also, from the California and Utah sides, from the southeast to the other side of Las Vegas.
Rosa will go straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, but the rains that will be coming on Monday will make her hear her arrival.
According to the National Weather Service of Phoenix, "Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones from Phoenix, 200 miles away, have maintained the status of tropical rainfall or depression.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that was 40 miles from the AZ boundary.
According to the latest predictions by the National Hurricane Center, 2-4 percent of the water will be collected, and a maximum of 6 percent of the water will be collected on the shores of Mogollo, Arizona.
As for other areas of the south-western part of the Forest (the Middle Rocky Mountains and the Great River, among others), 1-2 hectares of water will be collected; at most 4 hectares will be collected in isolated places.
As for those who expect sudden flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing, due to the droughts that the land has suffered.
Floods should not be reduced, but these rainstorms may be beneficial due to the drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought control service, 40 percent of Arizona’s droughts are undergoing severe droughts, which is the second-highest category, the weather.com site said.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The force of Hurricane Rosa will be maintained on Sunday morning and will generate maximum winds of 85 miles per hour; it will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and will have a speed of 12 miles per hour.
Colder rains are being found in the Pacific and, as a result, its ability is weakening.
They will arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or at night as tropical rainfall.
As heavy rains can occur in some parts of Mexico, there is a high risk of flooding.
According to the weather.com site, "the rainfall will leave 3-6 hectares of water from Baja California to the southwest of Sonora, and perhaps 10 hectares in some places."
Rosa will then pass from northern Mexico as a tropical rainfall in the early hours of Tuesday before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression; after that, it will cross Arizona and head south to Utah on Tuesday night.
"The major threats to Rosa or its rains are the heavy rains that will occur in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," the Hurricane Center said.
These rains will create hazardous rains and debris in the deserts and in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Trying to Kill Someone
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for murder after finding a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
The teenager was injured in the Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace area at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday morning (BST).
He was taken to the hospital and his condition was stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested that night in the Radstock area (Avon and Somerset), police said.
If someone has recorded or traced what happened to the phone, the policemen have asked for his help.
Trump says Kavanaugh needs to tolerate "unreasonable anger" from Democrats
"The votes cast for Judge Kavanaugh are repealing the Democratic party's reckless and outrageous tactics," Trump said in a speech held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Also, Trump said Kavanaugh had to tolerate the party's "irresponsibility and anger" in his nomination process.
On Tuesday, Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress, completely denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, according to the woman, when Kavanaugh raped adolescent a few decades ago.
Ford also testified after hearing his allegations.
The president said on Saturday: "The citizens of the United States saw Kavanaugh's adoration, intelligence and quality on that day."
"The votes to elect Judge Kavanaugh confirm that he has the best law-abiding authority of our time; this lawyer has given his entire life to protect the public service," the president told West Virginia followers.
In addition to the appointment of Kavanaugh, the president also spoke about the importance of the Republican Party in these elections.
“There are five weeks left to vote for the most important elections in our lives.
"I'm not going to participate, but I'm going to campaign," he said.
"That's why I'm here to fight for the best candidates."
Trump also said the Democratic campaign was using strategies to "interfere and make it harder."
According to a senior Republican spokesman for CNN, the voting process for Kavanaugh's nomination will be held in the Senate before Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami; the number of deaths is increasing
According to authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed as a result of earthquakes and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, most of whom were killed as waves destroyed the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to celebrate a festival in the city of Palu, but in the dark six-metre (18-foot) waves rebounded the coastline; several people were dragged to death and all who were on the way were destroyed.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"A tsunami warning was sent yesterday, but people were still on the beach and did not immediately escape, which is why they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroh, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster prevention agency (BNPB) in Jakarta.
"The tsunami dragged cars, barrels, and houses and destroyed everything in the territory," Nugroh says; moreover, the tsunami travelled from the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before reaching the coast.
"Many people have climbed to the trees to escape the tsunami and have survived," he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have gone to the 24 centres of Palu.
Several buildings and shops are destroyed, a mosque surrounded by bridges and water can be seen in the air photos taken by the disaster agency.
The replicas of the earthquake continued to sail off the coast on Saturday.
Earthquakes were observed in an area of 2.4 million people.
According to a report published by the Indonesian Technology Validation and Implementation Agency (BPPT), the energy level released by major earthquakes on Friday was 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is long and narrow, may have something to do with the magnitude of the tsunami, the agency said.
According to Nugroh, the disaster has been "extensive"; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have been rebuilt.
The bodies of some of the victims have been found among the residues of the rebuilt buildings, resulting in 540 more injuries and 29 disappearances.
Nugroh also said that the number of casualties and disasters could increase along the 300 kilometres (190 miles) coastline of Palu, especially a place called Donggala, which is close to the epicenter.
"The media are not working and we have no information," Nugroh said.
According to the data of the Red Cross, there are more than 300,000 people in the area; at present, the organization’s staff and volunteers are going to the affected areas to provide assistance.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received harsh criticism of the destruction of Palu for failing to provide information about the tsunami, but officials said the tides appeared after the warning was transmitted.
In a shared recording on social networks, you can see a man in a building, and he's screaming "there's a tsunami" to warn people on the street.
A few minutes later, he arrives on the waterfront and drags the buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately confirm the accuracy of the recording.
As the tsunami caused general electricity cuts, all media in Palu were stopped, so it was difficult for the competent authorities to arrange rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has sent aid from Jakarta and other cities to the bombings, but the evacuees still need food and priority goods.
The city’s airport is reopened to facilitate relief facilities and will be closed to the public until October.
The president of the game Widodo will visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has killed more than 800 people.
It is a tragedy.
Workers from Donggala's World Vision have arrived in the city of Palu without problems (the workers there have built possible shelters in the organization's office patio), but have directly seen the terrible situation left behind by disasters, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
That's very bad.
Although the support teams began to make sad repairs to work in disasters, some of the experienced workers and assistants complained that they had advised not to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, international financing, supply and personnel supply can only begin after it has been classified as a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘Okay, it’s a national disaster,’ we will be able to open the doors to receiving international aid, but it has not yet been classified as such.”
On the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Palun, friends and families who were still missing had not yet lost hope of the October miracle of the probability that their loved ones would appear.
On Saturday, a small child was taken out of the locker room.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had been working under the rubbish for two days, who was next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian national paratrooper's coach, trained two of the missing Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Some of the others, including Mandagi Jn., were students who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel.
"As an expert in the world of enlightenment, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon Jn. explained that in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the parapent community, he was sending WhatsApp messages to competitors, who were at the beach party.
His messages, however, received only one grey beak, not two blue marks.
"I think that means that these messages weren't sent," he added.
Thieves stole <0x24>26,750 while filling Newport on the Leveene's cash registers
On Friday morning, the robbers stole <0x24>26,750 from an employee who was filling an automatic box office in Newport on the Brink, according to new Newport Police Department officials.
The car driver was leaking an automatic box office in a complex entertainment and preparing to deliver more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the announcement.
While working, another man "attacked the Brinke worker after him" and stole a bag of money he had to hand over.
The witnesses saw a number of suspects fleeing the scene, as indicated in the statement, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the surprise.
If you have any information about their identity, please contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper has changed his name, and he is now
The rapper Kanye West has changed his name - He is now.
On Saturday, the change was announced on Twitter: "The creature was known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been using Ye for a while, and has used this ability as the title of his eighth album, which he posted in June.
He made the change before appearing on Saturday Night Live, as Yandhi is expected to present his final album.
She took part in the show instead of Ariana Grande, according to the creator of the show, because she could not participate due to "emotional reasons".
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has indicated that this word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I think the word 'yes' is the most widely used in the Bible and it means 'you' in the Bible," West said recently, speaking to the radio presenter Big Boy about the album.
"So I am you, I am us, we are us.
It comes from Kanye, which is the only thing he means to become Ye—to become the mirror of our good, our evil, our confusion, and our being.
This work better reflects who we are.”
He is one of the most famous rappers he has changed his name.
We also know Sean Combs as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has indicated that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with the West, has also changed his speeches and speeches.
Mexico’s AMLO has vowed not to use the military against its citizens
Mexico's elected president, Andres Manuel López Obrador, has vowed that he will not use armed force or army against citizens when the country will be living on the 50th anniversary of a repression that has shed blood against students.
López Obrador on Saturday sworn in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the army to repress Mexican citizens."
On 2 October 1968, the army fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people to force the rise of left-wing students throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to help Mexicans learn through monthly grants and more free public universities.
In his words, unemployment and educational disability are pushing young people into criminal groups.
The U.S. should double its funding.
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it uses to research in that area, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and expert at AA, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The rumors arose when several U.S. governments made statements about the AA, although the U.S. in general does not have an official AA strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the best AA innovation by 2030.
"A duplicate AA research would be a good start, as other countries are far from the U.S. and are looking forward to the next AA discovery," Leek said.
Double funding could double the chances of making big discoveries in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
This month, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who has published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has researched Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of the most important companies in the AA in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AA system that surpassed the U.S. high-level Othello reproductor and later worked as an executive at Microsoft Research, and was president of Google in China.
Lee praised the U.S. government’s previous technology competition, including the Advanced Defense Projects Research Agency’s Robotics Competition, and asked when the next would be to help identify the next candidates.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get the government’s grants, Lee says.
"It doesn't mean that China carries academic leaders, they're companies," Lee added.
Facebook, Google and a number of other technology companies have taken the lights from universities to operate in the AA in recent years.
Lee said a change in immigration policy would also help the U.S. to boost U.S. activities.
"I think the green card should be offered automatically to the AA doctors," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China finances academic institutions, as does the National Science Foundation and other government institutions in the U.S., but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee says.
Earlier that year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Center for Artificial Intelligence, where industrial and educational partners gathered, and announced that the White House had formed the Artificial Intelligence Commission.
And this month, DARPA has announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in the AI NEXT initiative.
As for NSF, it invests more than <0x24>100 million a day in AA research.
Meanwhile, EU law aimed at establishing the National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has not made progress in recent months.
The Macedonians had a referendum on whether to change the name of the country or not.
The country of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of the "ancient Republic of Macedonia", which would put an end to decades of conflict, blocking Greece from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, formerly a province called Macedonia, says that the name of its northern neighbors still takes its territory, and blocks it from entering NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say this change is at the expense of the ethnic identity of most Macedonian Slavic citizens.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and that the boycott had raised doubts about whether he would achieve 50 percent of the vote he would have to make in the referendum to be valid.
This is the question that could be read in the referendum paper: "Are you in favour of being a member of NATO and the EU with the agreement of Greece?"
Those in favour of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said he deserved the opportunity to join the EU and NATO institutions for Macedonia, being one of the countries that were created when Yugoslavia was disbanded.
"I am here to vote on the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, under the cover of the European Union to live freely, this will bring us a safer life," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, the members of Parliament have indicated that they will continue to be decisive about the outcome of the vote.
Three members of the Parliament will be required to change the name.
The State Election Commission said it was not a surprise to report until a few hours later.
However, only 16 per cent voted, compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 per cent were eligible to vote.
"I went to vote for my children, there's our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duskok voted to change the country's name in the Macedonian referendum and to have the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union, Strumican, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and climbing stairs in front of shops that wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to meet our conditions and not enter by the door of the servers," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can look at China or Russia and we can be part of the Euro-Asia unification.”
Prime Minister Zaev said the NATO member could bring so much investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is 20 percent.
"I think the majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of the population is in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
In his words, saying "yes" would "restore our future."
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Organization, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote - less than necessary.
Another poll, Telma TV in Macedonia, said 57 percent of residents thought they would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote for it.
In order for a referendum to be successful, more than 50 percent of the votes must be cast.
If the referendum was wrong, it would be the first serious failure of Western policy since the beginning of last May.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero beats all of Brighton's defense to go goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He ran among the three defenders of Brighton before entering the open field.
All of a sudden, Aguero saw himself surrounded by four elastic greens.
He pushed a defender out of many others after escaping at the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he turned to the left, and Sterling was there.
The English frontier returned the Aguero ball within the area at the first touch, and he used his right foot to overtake Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a toss to the right of the net.
"Aguero is having a lot of problems on his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were so happy to be able to get in at that moment.”
But Sterling gave the blue elastic bands a starting point in the Premier League.
He scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero picked up the ball in the Brighton field.
He gave Leroy Saneri a great pass on the left side.
Sane made a few touches before directing Sterling to the remote pole.
The blue elastic pushed the ball into the net before leaving the line.
City Hoffenheim will compete in the Champions League on Tuesday, at 12:55 p.m., at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Joker wants to destroy the Rockies
Out of the competition, there was no great reason to force another start.
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, wants to take advantage of the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but the Rockies still experience the consequences of equality, which is still an advantage for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West competition.
The Rockies have scored a commodity win at least 5-2 for the Nationals on Friday night, but they will still have to try to win the first level title.
"Even if we play for anything, at least we know that the Denver world will be on top of the people and that the opposing team will play at the best level in all the areas we have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in that?”
The nationals still have to announce a trigger, but it seems that they will leave Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th launch, conducted a throw-in interview on Thursday and seems to be acting as a thrower on Sunday.
Washington's hand is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and has scored 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump's statements in West Virginia
The president reviewed the situation and referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who was elected by the Supreme Court himself, when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we do is in the game.
We have five of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big -- I'm not a candidate, but, yes, if I am, that's why I'm everywhere to compete for big candidates."
Trump added, "You can see the horrific Democratic extremist group, you can see what's happening right now.
And they have no doubt that the power to use any means necessary to remove, see wisdom, see humility.
It doesn’t matter who harms them, to get control and power over them, we won’t give them that.”
The Democrats, he said, are aiming to "stop and distract."
"As you have seen in the last four days," he said, adding that the Democrats "are acting angry and angry and they are disgusting and fake."
She was named the Senator of the Democratic Party, Dianne Feinstein, by the Senate Court Committee, which received the calls of the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the file?
Uh, uh, what.
No, ah, no, I'm waiting for someone - that's the wrong body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Workers won’t have a lot of success.
They are intolerant of what they think.
When my local Momentum activists voted against me, it was not a big surprise.
In fact, I'm the last of the list that we weren't welcome from Labour MPet - for saying what we all thought.
Joan Ryan, who is a member of parliament, received similar treatment because she spoke in favour of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, in Europe, Jeremy was not in agreement with previous leaders on similar issues.
News about Friday's East Nottingham meeting said "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night’s GC meetings have been like this.
Unfortunately, today it has not been recalled to do the word politics "beautiful, respectful" if ever.
It remains to be seen that there are different views of the Labour Party and opinions that are acceptable to the party leaders are judged.
It started when Jeremy became a leader, when our members gave us the same political outlook before giving us a 180-degree turn and I would never accept it when they started asking me to accept the outlook - both in terms of national security and the single EU market.
Every time I speak in public - no matter what I say - I complain about the media policies on social networks and the amount of opinion they ask me to get out of there, the arrest, it happens, in terms of what I should not be in the Labour Party.
That's not just my experience.
For I know that I have better luck than some of my members, because the opinions cast against me are political.
Every day, I depend on the professionalism and honesty of the attacks of sexism or racialism, but never shyly, on those who have to deal with them.
One of the displeased aspects of this policy is that the current level of abuse seems to be normal.
Jeremy Corbyn stated last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we do not obtain a single opinion in each motion of "untrusted" or when the rules of the party become tighter.
In the last two years, I have received many and many remarks to lower my mind, not to speak so much, and thus to say, "I would be fine."
But I’m not in politics for that.
Thirty-two years ago, when I was a student, I left the room, pushed by the indifference of Thatcher's government, and entered the public services that most needed me - as a local councilor or minister of the government.
I have never concealed my political beliefs, not in the last edition.
No one in East Nottingham will have any doubts about my political views and the disagreements I have with the current leader.
I would say to those who promoted the Friday motion that when the country is targeting Brexit, which will harm our homes, businesses and public services, I don’t understand that I’m wasting time and energy arguing my loyalty to Labour leaders.
But my real message is not to push Nottingham, but to my voters, to be a member of the Labour Party or not: I am very proud to work for you and to speak to your best interests, I will not be opposed to threats or political expeditions.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is a leader who has not lost a match yet
The last two surprise attempts somehow changed the final result, but without any doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in the beautiful and fun Tennent Championship game of the day.
They are in the first place, and they are the only ones who have not lost one of the ten games.
In the end, they had a better defense, and they took better advantage of the options. The housemates and coach Peter Murchie have the full right to be happy.
"We've been put to the test so far, and we haven't lost one, so we have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose added: “My honor is to the Father, because they have used the choices better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute essay, performed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr before, but the yellow cards issued to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, left by the Warriors for the game, enabled him to add points to Melrosi and Jason Baggot.
Climo interrupted Ayr's leader through penalties before, at the end of the first part, he performed a solo experiment and Ayr went 17-5 to rest.
But Melrose started fine in the second part and Patrick Anderson's experiments, done by Baggot, reduced the side by five points.
Then there was a long pause due to Ruaridh Knott's serious injury, which was taken out of hand and when Ayr returned to the game, he reached a further distance when he became a member of Stafford McDowall's Climo.
Then, Blair Macpherson's yellow card was given to Ayr's captain, and Melrose again benefited him from having a more man, which he did not accomplish with Bruce Colvin's aunt, living at the end of his life.
The households returned and, when Hutchinson's yellow card was issued to Struan, to prevent Climo from having any balls, MacPherson touched the ground following Ayr's footsteps from the penalty margin.
Climo did as much, as he almost did from the beginning, as Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's wing and removed the wing of Gregor Henry in the fifth house experiment.
Still Game star set to start a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the actor Ford Kieran wants to jump into the world of hospitality, as he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, whose writer and longtime member is Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that it would be the last of the show, the ninth season, and it seems that Kiernan is planning the next life of Craiglang.
According to official registry, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to say anything about the story, although sources in Scottish Sun magazine said he wanted to enter a "brand of important restaurants" in Glasgow in Kiernan.
'The Sea Is Ours': Interior Bolivia Expects Courts to Reopen Road to the Pacific
The Marine Patrol is headquartered in La Paz in the cover of naval apparatus.
The building has a blue flag.
From Lake Titicaca on the bases of ships in the Amazon you can read the following slogan: "The sea is our right.
It is our duty to restore it.”
Throughout inner Bolivia, the 19th-century Chilean coastal clashes of bloodshed are still alive - once again they are eager to sail in the Mediterranean Sea.
These expectations are perhaps stronger now than in recent decades, as Bolivia expects to resolve the international courts after five years of reflection on October 1st.
"Bolivia is living in a good time, with a sense of unity and tranquility, and of course the outcome is better," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will continue to follow the international court's decision through giant screens distributed across the country, with the hope that the Hague Court will give a reason to Bolivia's demands - following decades of ceasefire negotiations - Bolivien's forced forced entry into force.
Evo Morales, the charming indigenous president of Bolivia - who is headquartered in the conflict for re-election next year - has also made several contributions around Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Ocean Bar, he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not decide for Bolivia and, as a result, will not change much.
The United Nations, which is headquartered in the region, has not been able to grant the territory of Chile and has indicated that it has not decided on the outcome of the negotiations that could be reached.
The resolution of the International Court of Justice concluded the negotiations and six months later indicated that the case was "not difficult," said Paz Zarate, an international expert from Chile.
And instead of promoting the cause of Bolivia, they have been backwards for the last four years.
"Today's Bolivian administration has taken the issue of reaching the sea as a priority," said Zarate.
President Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has shattered all the desire to do good in Chile, he says.
Bolivians and Chileans still have to deal with a number of issues, but it will be very difficult to continue to argue afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagrees with those who say the court’s resolution is particularly rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia "will have an extraordinary opportunity to re-establish relations with Chile" and "end the 139 years of disagreement, both for good."
Calzadilla said he disagreed with Morales - still one of South America's popular presidents - who is using the problem of the sea to get political aid.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to have a way to the Ocean Gate," he added.
“We had to look at the past as an opportunity to overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Will Not Happen Until It Can Be Believed In The US
North Korean Prime Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not be disarmed until Washington could be trusted.
This was stated by the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He asked the United States at the Singapore summit, in front of the leaders of the Algerians, to fulfill the pledge.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un have been on the verge of blocking nuclear diplomacy again for more than three months.
Rik says that those who continue to be "utopia" and think that the U.S. obstacles will put North Korea on its feet in the face of the declaration of end of the Korean War.
Washington does not want to agree on the confession before Pyongyang withdraws its weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second chancellor.
But there is very much skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang because it is the only way the country seems to guarantee its security and about giving up all weapons.
Pompeo's plan is to go to Pyongyang next month to arrange a second round between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris fashion show, he showed the newest line of massive hats on High Street Road next to you
If you want to expand the collection of your hats or if you want to completely block the sun, here is the answer.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of strange large-sized hats in the 2019 spring-wood collection, which left the style shown at Paris Fashion Week in the dark.
Unpractical chapels have arrived on Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular designs to the forefront.
The most prominent piece of Valentino's, with a light-colored beige hat, covered the heads of the models.
Among other large-sized accessories we have a kind of velvet-filled corner, a weird hat, and also a kind of pine - but they are not designed to heat the head.
Thom Brown also showed a collection of strange masks - time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks have lipsticks and Hannibal Lecterre looks more like high-end lipsticks.
One looked like a mask for scrubbing, with glasses and sheets, while the other looked like ice cream.
If you are a fan of fashion, you have good news.
Experts say that haters will go out to the streets, even around you.
The large-sized hats come from ‘La Bomba’, the two-legged broad-winged lace hat, ranging from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski and wearing the most famous hats we’ve ever seen.
The cultural mark behind the chapel, which was not at all practically successful in social networks, has brought another object to the passageway - a beach-shoulder bag, almost as large as the bathrobe model it carries.
La Riviera is the protagonist of Jacquemus’s Spring 2019 collection La Riviera in the Paris Fashion Week, with an orange-colored handbag, cut with a velvet slit and a white leather.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope that with large hats and large beach bags coming to the main streets next summer, it would be difficult for the designer to ignore the demand for supplements for giants."
John Edward: Basic Language Skills for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland are making academic excellence records, and in 2018 they have continued, with the results of the studies, which have been strengthened with the excellent results in individual and group sports, among others, in music and other projects in the community.
With 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools are being replaced by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, and are trying to provide the best service between students and their parents.
The goal of independent schools is to prepare students for higher education, for their chosen career and as a citizen.
Since we can design and implement a custom curriculum in the school as an education sector, we have seen that modern languages continue to be the usual choice chosen by students.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, you will come to his mind.
If you speak to him in his language, you will come to his heart.”
It’s a powerful way to remind people from other countries that we don’t just need to use English to build relationships and gain confidence in them.
We can see from the results of this year’s final exams that there are the languages that are most passed in the top of the independent schools.
68 percent of students who learn a foreign language have achieved the best A rating.
The data, collected at SCIS’ 74 pupil schools, shows that 72 percent of pupils achieved the best A rating in Chinese Mandarin; 72 percent in German; 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This verifies that Scottish independent schools view foreign languages in the future undoubtedly as an indispensable skill that young people and children will need.
Languages today serve as a focus on teaching (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools.
A 2014 survey by the EU Commission found that one of the main reasons that was found to fill the job was non-language knowledge.
Increasingly, knowledge of languages is becoming essential to preparing young people for future careers.
With more opportunities for work demanding languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the careers chosen, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifetime advantage.
Being able to speak directly to people from foreign countries will automatically place the first person at the head of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey of 4,000 adults in the EU, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language as a normal conversation, and between those who spoke French alone, it increased to two digits, 15 percent.
That’s why it’s so important to invest in learning languages in today’s children.
Speaking more than one language, which is mostly used in economic developments, will give your children more opportunities to find better employment.
In Scotland, they are distinguished by the language they teach in schools.
Some students prefer more modern classical languages, while others prefer the ones that seem to be important to the EU by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
As your child’s interests are, there will always be a wide language opportunity to study independently at school with teachers who are experts in the field.
The aim of independent schools in Scotland is to train children in various ways to be successful in the future and to provide tools for this.
We cannot deny this time, in an international business environment, where languages are indispensable for the future of the country, so that is what education needs.
In fact, modern languages should be understood as an "international communication capability."
Independent schools will continue to offer their opportunities, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut with Lakers in San Diego on Monday.
First-class star LeBron James is waiting for fans to debut in Los Angeles.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play for Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Monday.
He hasn’t yet determined how many minutes he will play.
"There's more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel said on Twitter that James will play time limits.
After training this week, James was asked about the six-match pre-season schedule at the Lakers.
"I don't need a pre-season match to prepare for this stage of my career," he replied.
Trump's West Virginia Rally, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will host the rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump will be the first of five rallys next week, and will visit several of his friends’ locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Waiting for the vote to be repealed to fill the Supreme Court square, the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress in the midterm elections that Trump will be seeking.
What time is today’s West Virginia Trump myth and how can it be viewed on the Internet?
Trump's turn is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. in West Virginia today, September 29, 2018.
You will be able to watch Trump’s mitin in West Virginia online via YouTube streaming.
Trump appears to be directing this week's hearings of appointee Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court, until a response from the Senate has been held to the FBI's investigation.
But the main purpose of this revolution is to help Republicans win a few votes in the November elections.
Trump’s campaign, he said, aims to “promote volunteers and support the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"The controversy with Congress is of particular importance and the President will travel to as many states as possible as he enters the campaign session," Trump's campaign spokesman said, who did not give permission to name it.
The Wesbanco Arena program will allow today’s rally to cover Ohio and Pennsylvania followers and Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
It will be the second time Trump will visit West Virginia last month, winning the status by 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Virginia Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who is going after him.
It’s not a good sign for Morrisey to have to go there to help in the election,” Simon Header, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team will try to continue Sunday's individual competition
After three sessions on one side, Saturday afternoon's fourth was what this Ryder Cup needed.
The key to the moment is the concept of sport invented from top to bottom, in which players believe, but not for other competitions.
So you can't say it's time now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they have four, so I think it's time, somehow," said Jordan Spieth, on the field one day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, with four points, out of the thirteen in the game.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind is not on their side, and they need help, mostly Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together and scored three points.
Spieth has been absolutely decisive, from equation to green, and is directed with the pattern.
These screams to celebrate have become more and more intense as the chess moves forward, and he has won a major putt, winning four all-square, after Thomas lost two after two.
He celebrated with another scream like a whore won in the 15th match, which indicates that the American team is not outside the competition.
"You have to look for the strengths and take care of your game alone," said Spieth.
That’s what these players do.
18 holes to get out.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the historic players in the Ryder Cup.
There are four European couples out of four who have vowed to fail.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not throw a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon, the bogeys were also avoided, and on Friday the last nine.
This clash and the crowd's energies that came to and from it became a duo to overcome on Sunday and was not a more famous European player than Fleetwood and Molinari when the sun came out to close Europe's victory at Le Golf National.
It is better to have both in different holes.
It’s too early to talk about Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson accelerated the work of Sergio García, the best of four, when he was equal to Alex Noren.
They put a Bogey and two doubles in front of the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole that was never too close to defeating.
On Sunday, however, there was no one to help you get out of your hole.
When the couples were in close contact with each other, they gave advice, did not give them, and at one point they could see how the strategy could change.
Europe played better as a team, and had a significant advantage in the final, but the fourth-round session showed that the U.S. team had the ability to fight, although some, especially the United Stateside, had doubts.
Europe wins 10-6 in the Ryder Cup final
Europe took a significant advantage in the Ryder Cup final after Saturday's quarter-finals scored 10-6 against the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, he scored two victories against Tiger Woods, and now they scored four valuable points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to regain Hazelin's lost prize two years ago, was head coach this morning and won a 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered greater resistance, and they won two games, but were unable to overcome the side.
Jim Furyk needed eight points to hold the prize in 12 individual matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the only European rookie to have won four points in a row and with Molinari, after a great weekend called "Molliwood", they are second in Ryder Cup history to win four points in four games.
After four-balling Woods and Patrick Reed, he perfected the game with Woods tired and Bryson Dechambeau beat the American rookie with 5 and 4 lights.
Woods, after playing two games on Saturday, showed a touch of excellence, but lost 19 of the 29 games in fourball and foursomes, 7 in a row.
Justin Ros took a break for the morning fourballs and returned with Henrik Stenson to win the quarterfinals 2&1 for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the world's best and third.
Europe did not find its way to Paris in a pleasant day to the southwest, fresh.
The three-time winners Jordan Spiethe and Justin Thomase set a benchmark for the Americans, two points, on Saturday.
They scored a 2–1 win against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball match and then also defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 quarters after losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team succeeded in overcoming the four-point side and entering the individual, although the Furyken side needed only an equation to hold the prize.
After the second best two days, after the Sunday counter-offensive, they will be standing in front of him.
North Korea has given a no-brainer to drop arms without any confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the sanctions continued to obstruct trust in the United States and that in such a situation they would not, in any way, stop making nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's Annual General Meeting that North Korea took "significant measures of goodwill" last year to test nuclear weapons and missiles, to abandon nuclear testing sites and to stop the development of technology and nuclear weapons.
"We don't see the right answers from the United States," he said.
“Without U.S. confidence, there is no trust in our national security and, anyway, we can’t leave the first weapons alone.”
Rik repeats North Korea's family complaints about Washington's resistance in a "phase" denuclearization process, where North Korea would be rewarded for pausing it a little bit. His statements appear to be significant in the past, according to the unilateral statement in Pyongyang.
Rik Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump are referring to Singapore's first flagship of US President and North Korean leader on June 12, when Kim vowed to "desnuclearize the Korean Peninsula" and Trump vowed to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is looking for a way to formally end the Korean War between 1950-1953, but the United States has indicated that Pyongyang should abandon its first weapons.
The U.S. has refused to accept the sanctions imposed on North Korea by international voices.
"Again, the United States says it will have to drop the first weapons and continue to increase the pressure on the sanctions to force them to achieve their goal, and it is against the "declaration of the end of the war"," he said.
"It's a utopia that we don't know when we think that the coercion will put us on their feet.
The problem is that the punishment continues to increase in distrust.”
Rickey has not mentioned the second U.S.-led Kim and Trump deal announced at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, on the other hand, mentioned three meetings in the last five months between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae, adding: "If South Korea had the other side instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have been blocked."
However, the tone of Ri’s speech would be completely different last year, when North Korea’s UN General Assembly stated that missiles were inevitably looking at the United States since Trump called “Devil President” Kim “Missile” in a suicide mission.
This year, in front of the United Nations, Trump, who said North Korea would be "stricken," praised Kim for having the courage to take steps to deter weapons, but said there was still a need to do so and that North Korea would continue to face sanctions against nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he hadn't had the time for that, "whether it's two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should award Pyongyang for its move.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in front of the NB Security Council on Thursday: "We must continue to strengthen the Security Council's sanctions without fail, verifying that its denuclearization is real."
The Security Council has single-handedly encouraged North Korea to block the sanctions imposed since 2006 as an attempt to finance Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic programs.
He met with Pompeo Rire outside the NB General Assembly and later indicated that he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare the second cap.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not well.
When he returned from Pyongyang in July, he said that he had only achieved something for North Korea, after complaining that he had been making "demands made by the people" for hours.
In a meeting with Moon, North Korea vowed to leave a missile site and a nuclear complex if the U.S. takes the necessary measures."
Kimi said he was looking for "measures that are relevant to us" that Trump was Singapore's agreed security guarantees and focused on normalizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard have taken the necessary courses to take a long break.
This year’s Harvard University course will make graduates more sleepy, trying to cope with an increasingly widespread culture of coffee-taking graduates.
One teacher saw that at the world’s best university, students are losing prizes in a basic way to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospitals, designed the course, which he believes is the first such in the EU.
He began his course when he gave a lecture on the influence of sleeplessness during the period of study.
'A little girl came up to me and said, 'Why do I have to do that now alone, the last year of my school?'
"No one told him how important it was to sleep well, and that surprised me," said the Telegraph.
The course, which is offered earlier this year, explains to students the impact of suitable sleep habits on their studies and sports outcomes, in addition to improving their well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and director of the University's health services, said the university had decided to start the course when they saw students sleeping less during the week.
The long-term course takes a number of interactive courses.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students see the effect of caffeine and light pressing coffee pots, jars, coaches and books, and see the impact of less sleep on sports performance and the importance of sleeping habits.
In another section, participants are told that having too little sleep can cause heart attacks, and that it can increase the risk of depression or cancer.
On an outdoor map, using interactive icons, participants are invited to reflect on their daily habits.
"We know that we will not suddenly change the habits of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know, if you choose to smoke cigarettes, just as you have the right to know the consequences that this will have on your health,” Czeisler added.
There is still a culture of pride to make “gauges,” he says, and as modern technologies and students are affected, the problem of making more or less pressures increases.
Good sleep, with good quality sleep, should be the "secret weapon" to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - and also to gain weight, because less sleep puts the brain hungry and we will always be hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Czeisler design the course, and one of his first classes at Harvard in his first year.
The course showed her that she opened her eyes and encouraged her to take part in a course that took part in the campus.
The next step, he hopes, would be to ask for a research similar to the next graduates before entering the competitive organization.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm to determine when to go to bed, as well as to warn, and to recognize the effects of the harmful effects of "blue light" that electronic screens and LEDs emit, which can alter circadian rhythms.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga overtook the men of Warrrarden
The Rangers suffered another defeat in the Dolly Mengar strike, set 1-0 in favor of Steven Gerrard in Livingston.
Ibrox wanted to win for the first time after winning 4-1 St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holter's team resulted in a second loss to Gerrard's team as a coach in his 18th game, with his eight points allowing us to control the Hearts of the Leader of the Landbrokes Championship.
We were seven minutes ahead of the strike, and Rangers' work did not achieve equilibrium.
The Rangers have now dropped to sixth position, while Livingston has climbed to third place and are behind the Hibernians only by goal.
The problem could have been more serious for Rangers, as Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury that had to be thrown from the outside by an object that they said had hit him.
Gerrard made eight changes and managed to reach the finals of Ayr Betfred Kopar.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livi 11, who took a point to Heartsey last week and would be happy to see her well-fitted suits twisted each time the opponents turn.
The Rangers dominated possession, but Livingstone benefited them more from their games.
Scott Pittmani McGregor, on the wing of the mountain, should have entered the goal, but the midfielder did not take advantage of the opportunity.
A deep free throw at Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow only managed to retreat to the rear foot.
The Rangers took control, but at the end of the day their expectations for the game seemed to be greater than their beliefs.
It seemed to Alfredo Morelos that there should have been a penalty on the border of the fourth, when he and Steven Lawless were beaten, but Judge Steven Thomson did not take into account the Colonial appeals.
The Rangers managed to make only two throws out in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's mild hit.
Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have damaged the development of the game, but no one can deny it, at least given the great effort they deserved.
Once again, the Rangers failed to face a stopping play at Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, and he quietly chose Menga to make a simple ending.
Gerrard took action during the rest by alternating with Coulibaly Ryan Kent, and the change had an immediate effect when the southern wing passed to Morelos, but the horrific Kelly ran from her line to block her.
But the Livingston continued to force outsiders to play their favorite game, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long after long passes.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase his advantage, but McGregor bravely held him before making a head coming from the corner of Lithgow.
The Rangers' deputy, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a penalty at the end when he broke up with Jacobs, but Thomson did not again make a case against him.
Almanaka: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now our "Sunday Morning" page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity: following his invention came what he called the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger has been the frontier of science, and it has also become the frontier of pop culture, as in the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado," where the seemingly unscientific cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “Geiger is a counter that is used to search for radioactive minerals, uranium, for example.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms caused by the radioactivity of minerals."
“Yeah, they’re listening right now!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 when he was 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer could teach malignant cells to ‘see’ the immune system
A new vaccine against cancer could teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malignant cells
Tchertok teaches malignant cells within the immune system treatment
The method is to remove immune cells from the patient and then alter them in the laboratory.
You can then see a protein that is often common in cancer and then re-inject it.
The test shot is delivering very good results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who had been treated with pig-concerned with the malignant immune system managed to eradicate ophthalmological cancer for more than 18 months.
Here is the method: when removing immune cells from the patient and altering them in the laboratory, to be able to "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then repositioning the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a great vaccine for the future."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of various types of cancers," including breast, pelvic, colon and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
When taking immune cells from patients and reaching carcinogenic cells, a similar approach works in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West entered a Trump-backed diary, wearing a MAG championship, following the SNL protest.
It didn't work out well.
Kanye West was yelled at the studio in a Saturday Night Live when he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would be running for president again in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great championship, began to speak badly against the Democrats and reaffirmed Trump's stance.
“Every time I talk to a white person, they say to me, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s racial?’”
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have been away from America for a long time now," he said.
Matt Damon began his session with a sketch, in which he mocked the testimony made by Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't easy, West's offensive speech was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock West was trying to make fun of the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had gone wrong in the middle of the mountain because of his jacket.
“They told me in the middle of the mountain.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with that champion.’
They attacked me!
And then they say I'm in a deep place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see where I'm going?" saying, "I'm going to wear my superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
"Test the love."
As a result of his speeches, at least a couple of jokes came from the public and appeared to be embarrassed by the members of the SNL room, Variety reported, and a person who was there told the magazine: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West was brought in at the last moment to replace Ariana Grande, who had been killed a few days earlier by her boyfriend, rapper Rac Miller.
The web surprised a lot of people with the interpretation of the song I love it, dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received the protection of Candace Turner, the leader of the TPUSA Conservative group, as he published this message: "To one of the bravest spirits: THE TRUTH OF OUR MASTER IS EMPLOYABLE."
But as interview presenter Karen Hunter shrugged out, West was just "being like him, and that's wonderful."
“But I don’t want to reward a person who makes his own an ideology that is harmful to the community (by buying his music or clothing or protecting his “art”).
He is free.
And so are we," he added.
Before the session, the rapper said on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it is now "the creature called Kanye West so far".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puffy Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg also named Snoop Lion, and not to mention the nine legends of Prince music, which changed his name to a duck and became the artist Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has appeared against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow in the HBO Middle Ages fantasy violin series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has appeared in opposition to the stereotype of the machi hero, indicating that as a result of the appearance of such papers on the screen, young boys often feel they need to be tough enough to be respected.
In a statement to The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said he thought something was wrong and asked him how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in <0x23>MeToo's time.
Kit is also a star of Game of Thrones and also married to 31-year-old Rose Leslie recently, and admits that she is "confessed" that she has to deal with the problem.
"Personally, and with great certainty, at this moment, I'm thinking - what have we done wrong with masculinity?" she said.
"What have we been teaching when men are growing up, given the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can also be responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity as a result of the character being very masculine.
He continued, “What is self-centered and what is taught?
What does it teach on television, and in the streets, that the way of being a man is what makes young boys feel like?
I think that's one of the most important issues of our time. How can we change that?
It’s clear that something went wrong for the young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that he would not do any of Game of Thrones' previous or subsequent series when the series ends next summer, and said "he's finished with warships and horses".
From November onwards, Kit Sam Shepard will appear in the return of True West. It is the story of a filmmaker and his brother; his brother is stolen.
The actor recently announced that he thinks his wife Rose is the best thing Game of Thrones has ever given him.
"I met my wife in this session, and so it gave me my future family and life from here on out," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the woman in Kit's Jon Snow character, who won the Emmy Award in the fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
GIB/Hiesa: China has reported a 14 percent increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of citizens with GIB and HISA.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health officials.
More than 40,000 new cases have been registered in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are sexually transmitted, and that’s a change to the past.
Traditionally, GIB was rapidly spreading as a result of blood transfusions contaminated in some areas of China.
But in this way, the number of people infected with GIB was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a Yunnan provincial conference.
However, the number of people with GIB and HIV in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
Sexually transmitted GIB is a serious problem in the Chinese LGTB community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGTB persons is widespread.
Based on the country’s conservative values, research has estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men marry a woman.
Many transmissions of diseases occur due to the use of improper sexual protection in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ordered universal access to GIB medicine within the scope of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied the data of GOP senators filtered by workers, and put up “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Secretary of State Maxine Waters on Saturday accused a member of her work that she had published personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
Democrats in Los Angeles said the statements were driven by "ultra-square-level" experts and websites.
"More lies, lies, and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published included information from three U.S. senators: Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, during a hearing of allegations of sexual inadequacy against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Senate Supreme Court in Capitol Hill.
The three senators questioned the filtration of Kavanaugh and came later.
Conservatives such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the source-identifying IP address was linked to the Waters office and published information from a member of the Waters plant, Hill said.
"This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and a complete lie," Waters continued.
"The members of my company, who have put their integrity, personal information and security at risk as a result of these false allegations, are not responsible for the filtration of this information.
“An unfounded allegation is completely false and a complete lie.”
Waters’ statements immediately received criticism on the line, for example from Ari Fleischer, a former White House press briefing.
"It's an act of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that he has no character to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone who hasn't done something, they don't have to be angry.
You don’t have to show a challenge.
There is no need to question the prosecutor’s motives.
It must appear quietly and with a good temple.”
Fleischer appeared to want to compare Waters' reaction to the criticisms made by Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh as critics accused him of resentment at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to remove Waters in mid-term elections, said on Twitter.
"If the meaning is true," he whispered.
In his statements, Waters said his office had warned that "the authorities and law enforcement entities were eligible for these deceptive statements.
"We make sure that those who have broken the law will know who they are," he continued, "and that they will have to respond before the law to any member of my work and to any action that is harmful and dangerous to all members."
Johnny English Strikes Again - The Parody of Little Power Rowan Atkinson
Now it has become traditional to look for the meanings of Brexit in any new film that has a British spectrum, and this does not appear to be applicable in the franchise of Johnny English action-media parody. It started in 2003, right with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English-Reebor.
What kind of garbage we are clearly showing about the fact that by satirizing ourselves, will we achieve a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, Johnny English, with big eyes out and a rubbery face, has renewed the license to scrape things for the second time: his name shows above all things that a comic book designed for non-English cinema is not a comic book.
Although he has a special desire for glamour, he is a secret agent with a bit of Clouseau's resemblance, of course, he is also a glimpse of Mr. Bean and a part of a guy who assists Chariots of Fire with a single note at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In Barclaycard's already forgotten television ads, Atkinson played the traveler and is based on the mysterious international man himself, leaving behind chaos.
There are a couple of days or so in this last episode.
I liked how Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the rotor's crosses gave him hits in the helmet.
Atkinson's play for comedy is seen on the screen, but humor is lacking and superfluous, especially when movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible are now included in the comedy.
It seems to me that the children are being directed by humans more than the adults, and for me, Johnny English’s senseless adventures are not as cunning and bright as the jokes of the character Bean in Atkinson’s silent films.
This is the ultimate prerequisite: Britain has a serious problem.
A cyberhacker infiltrates the UK's supersecret web of spies, revealing the identity of all British agents who are working, and is relieved to be the agent in service. Unfortunately, a small paper for Kevin Eldon.
That's too much for a prime minister with a character that's punctual and deceptive, as she's already completely losing political fame: Emma Thompson gives her best with a character almost like Teresa May, but the script doesn't help much.
His intelligent advisers tell him that he will have to recover someone who is in retirement because all active spies are at risk.
And that means Johnny English walks as much as he can. Now he's a teacher in a nice place, but he's giving us some confidential school about acting as a hidden operative: there's some nice jokes, because English offers a 'School of Rock' kind of spy academy.
English are again taken to Whitehall to make an emergency briefing, and he reunites with his former member, Bough. Again Ben Miller interprets that character.
Bough is a married man now tied to a naval commander, and Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost in that kind of wealthy paper.
So, in the Secret Service of Your Majesty, we are once again in the action of making things worse, Batman and Robin, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful fatal femme Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the British tech billionaire who claims he can solve the computer unrest has an enthusiasm for the prime minister, Jason Volta, who is a billionaire, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventures as a waitress, they set fire to a French restaurant. They create chaos by entering Volta's luxury yacht, and the English lights up the complete anarchy of virtual reality as a result of attempts to ignite virtual-reality volcanoes.
All periods are watching this final sequence, but despite being pleasant and skeptical, it has a lot of children's television.
It's kind of.
And as with other Johnny English movies, I thought this: Can Rowan Atkinson not give the British film industry a paper that deserves his talents?
The Labour Party has denied that the British are preparing a five-day plan to work in a four-day week.
Jeremy Corbyn is looking at a radical Labour Party plan, which predicts British people to work for a week but pay for five days.
It seems that the parties want to give workers what they have saved through the revolution of artificial intelligence, by giving them one more birthday.
Workers would have a three-day weekend, but they would still take the same salary home.
Sources have pointed out that the idea is "inserting well" into the economic agenda of the party and that it wants to put the country on the side of the workers.
The four-week weekend has received the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as a way to get workers out of their way to change the economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "It is expected to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen from one day to another, but the four-working-day week comes with the side’s vision of reinforcing the workers’ economy, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be a party that supports such an idea, as the Green Party has advocated a four-day working week in the 2017 general election campaign.
Anyway, the aspirations have not yet received the full support of the Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy, and the party doesn't take it as such."
In the dark, Minister John McDonnell used a congress last week by the Labour Party to clarify his view of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said, undoubtedly, that the power of "unauthorized directors" and "speculators" should be removed from the companies that provide public services.
In addition, the current shareholders of water companies may not be fully involved in the planet of the shadow minister, as a Labour government may have misbehaviour if it is seen that there is a misbehaviour.
In addition, he reiterated that there were plans for employees to enter the corporate boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees, since they could charge annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say the FBI’s 60 Minutes Kavanaugh investigations could change their opinions or not.
With regard to the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the FBI's investigation has delayed his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and has raised doubts as to whether the results of the investigation could be withdrawn by a Republican senator or not.
In an interview posted on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a 60 Minutes correspondent, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was anything the FBI could do to change their views.
Kennedy appeared more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I think, of course, yes," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this happened, I called him, he got to know the allegation, I said, 'Did you do that?'
He answered with a certainty, of course, without a doubt.”
Graham's votes, however, appear to be written on the stone.
"I have a decision with regard to Brett Kavanaugh and he would also bear the charges that would cause an explosion," he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett reluctantly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all those who are mentioned by him have not been able to verify that.
He's 36 years old.
“I don’t see anything changing.”
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizens Festival will be held in New York City, an annual music event that brings infuriating artists and has a serious mission: eradicating world poverty.
With the 17th edition this year, the Global Citizens Festival will bring thousands of people to the Great Zelai in Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to the 20th anniversary of the event’s real goal of self-awareness.
The Global Citizens Festival, created in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, which is an international support group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively struggling against poverty.
To receive a free admission to the event (if you are not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), those who want to go to the concert must perform several tasks or "actions", such as sending an electronic message to a world leader, making a phone call or making a call to a large number of calls in another way that is valid.
But what success did Global Citizen have when it was 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is it an original idea to encourage people to take an action through a free concert, or is it just another case of what is called "clicktivism", that is, to make people feel like they are making a real change by signing a request online or sending a message?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, pushing to achieve a number of goals.
According to him, world leaders have pushed policies and commitments of more than <0x24>37 billion to announce these actions, and these policies and commitments will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the team mentioned 390 commitments and predictions derived from the actions, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been paid or received.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on a total of 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and implementers committed to helping children develop their full potential, which is based in the United Kingdom. It has ordered Rwanda to pay <0x24>35 million for malnutrition in the fourth-largest global disaster disaster.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and members of Global Citizens like you, we will move into the social history of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, at a 2018 conference in London.
In addition, after more than 5,000 actions taken in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance the Power of Nutrition project, which will help 5 million women and men with nutrition-related hand-to-hand support.
In response to these FAQ questions on the website, "What makes you think about the disappearance of extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, “It’s going to be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we’ll fall down and fail.
But just like the great anti-apartheid movements and civil rights that we have before us, we will achieve stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will be presenting the event in New York this year, among others, Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. military could use Russian energy exports as a "block" - Home News
"If necessary," Washington could use its army to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, said U.S. Internal Journalist Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
According to Zinke, Russia's relations with Syria - as it is noted, as legitimate governments there are operating the demand - are just an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think they are the reason they want to be in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the southern slope of Europe," he said, according to the information.
And according to the officer, there are ways and means to manage this.
"The United States, with our Army, has the ability to ensure that the maritime lines are open, and, if necessary, to block them, to ensure that their energy market is not reached," he said.
Zinke was speaking to the participants of an event organised by the Energy Alliance for Consumers, a non-profit group that presents itself as the "voice of the energy of consumers" in the United States.
Washington has compared the approaches it has taken to have relations with Russia and Iran, ultimately stating that they are the same.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic opportunity we have is to exploit and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "single resource" economy with a dependence on fossil fuels.
The Trump administration has come to promote its export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers, when it was on a mission to replace it.
To that end, Trump administration officials, and US President Donald Trump himself, tried to convince Germany to leave the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, making it “positive” for Moscow, according to Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly underlined the <0x24>11 million Nord Stream 2 route, which will double the capacity of the former one by 110 billion cubic meters, a mere economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons, and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we agree that energy cannot be a tool for pressuring and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, Russia's energy minister, at the end of a meeting in Moscow in September with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry.
The U.S. has received a negative reception from Germany, and has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industry, has called on the United States to refrain from entering into EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious reason when a third state is disrupting our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin following a recent meeting.
Elizabeth Warren "will look into the future" of the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would be "examining" the presidential nomination after the mid-term elections.
He was in a township in Holyoke, Massachusetts, where Warren reaffirmed his intention to present him.
"There is a time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, and that demands that there be a woman on top," she said.
"After January 6th, I will consider the presentation of the presidential candidates."
Warren gave an opinion on Donald Trump in the town hall, stating that he was "putting the country on the wrong path".
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren made a clear statement in criticizing Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said: "It's clear we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a poll published Thursday showed that most Warren voters don’t think they should be running for president by 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said senators should not present presidential candidates, according to a survey conducted by the University of Suffolk's Center for Political Research/Boston Globe.
Twenty-two of them appeared in favour of the presentation.
According to the survey, Deval Patrick has more support for former governor, with 38 percent of the respondents endorsing a possible submission and 48 percent endorsing it.
Other names appearing in connection with a possible 2020 presentation include Joe Biden's presidential candidate and Bernie Sanders Vermont's senator.
Biden said he would officially make a decision for January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin in Donald Trump's election campaign
Track Palin, 26, died a year after entering Iraq in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"Because he is carrying my son, because he is carrying when he returns, I feel identified with the consequences of post-traumatic stress confusion and the vulnerabilities our salaries bring back to other families who are suffering from Oklahoma," Trump said in a statement.
Palin said the arrest was a "significant account" and said of his son and other veterans of the war that "something has changed, they have returned hard, other soldiers they have joined, and other members of the air force and other members of the army have been arrested."
On Monday, they were arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, who was accused of domestic violence and intoxicated by a declaration of possession of a weapon, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 states, D.C. support the impugnation of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are defending the impugnation of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts on Friday filed a friendly statement to support an asylum seeker in Washington, defying the police, according to NBC News.
It has not been disclosed the full name of the applicant for the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August.
She said her partner "and her gang members" had caused sexual abuse, but U.S. officials denied the asylum application made on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys from the state that is defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as creating a large number of U.S. asylum seekers because they are countries with widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a decision taken by the Immigrant Appeals Committee, which allowed homeless immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
In a statement by the District Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine said on Friday, "the new police are overlooking the state, federation, and international law of the years."
"The federal law states that all asylum applications must be allocated on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a bar violates that principle," the amicus curiae statement said.
In addition, lawyers argued in the paper that policies denying entry to immigrants are damaging the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide "the necessary workforce."
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"The asylum is available to those who are leaving their country because of their country or because they are afraid of being part of a race, religion, nationality or social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum itself has never been able to solve all the problems that people face on a daily basis, even if the problems are serious.
Efforts to rescue desperately in Palu, while doubling the number of dead, in the race to find survivors
For those who survived, the situation became more and more serious.
"It feels a lot of tension," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma's mother, who was sick while calming her baby in the city of Palu.
“He carries ambulances every minute.
There's a lack of cleanliness."
The residents see them returning to their homes destroyed, taking their water-picked items, trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals, devastated by 7.5 earthquakes, have been overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, for example, Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital. Patients were being treated outside, as a result of continuous replications.
His eyes gleamed, telling him how he felt the violent movement of the earthquake in the hotel room when he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I've been stuck against the sands of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard the woman ask for help, and then the silence.
I don’t know what happened to him or his daughter.
I hope they will be okay.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Invasion' with Propaganda
After putting a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper that promoted the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread his propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump said the second-most-selling Chinese newspaper in the Des Moines Register, the state of Iowa, mentioned the additional paid last Wednesday, after accusing China of trying to enter the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections.
Trump has been accused of wanting to enter the U.S. election in Beijing, citing what U.S. officials told Reuters, a new campaign in Washington that was on the rise to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war, in which each country has imposed tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliation efforts at the start of the trade war were thought to have provided support to the Republican Party of Trump to attack exports from states such as Iowa, China and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the Chinese U.S. ambassador and longtime governor of Iowa, one of the states that exports the most agricultural goods to China, has said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad stated in an article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "China is now intensifying its attack by putting propaganda publications in our free press."
"By spreading propaganda, he is using a strong tradition of American press freedom and freedom of the press by placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register newspaper," Branstad wrote.
"Instead, in the press quiz here on the street in Beijing, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the different opinions the Chinese people could have about China's economic conflict," the media said in a statement from the Communist Party of China.
He added that "one of the best-known Chinese newspapers avoided the offer to publish his article," but did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans beat women's voters with Kavanaugh's debacle ahead of midterm elections, analysts warn
As many high-ranking republicans await and defend candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a decline among women, especially in the next midterm elections.
Emotions about the subject have been very strong, and most republicans have been registered to continue with the voting.
These accounts cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, regarding an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher has said he has doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) could put pressure on an FBI investigation to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor will they forget in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the chief advisor, and MoveOn's national spokeswoman for the progressive group, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted "Happy November!" that they were protesting in front of the Senate that the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee had decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment, according to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony.
"The sovereignty and motivation of the Democrats will be out of the way," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news website.
“People say it has had a big impact, that’s true.
But it could still have an even greater influence, especially among women and young people in minorities who do not have a strong vote, between the ages of 18 and 29, even if they often do not like the president."
Before making a public witness, Ford explained the details of the sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidate, analysts suggested that there might be a downturn if the Republicans decided to proceed with the repeal.
"It has become a great style for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, a former president of the National Committee of Republicans, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"The issue is not whether the committee votes, the last vote, or whether Kavanaugh should sit in the chair of the accused, whether it is how the Republicans handled the issue and how they treated the woman," he told reporter Guy Cecil.
Either way, it seems that Americans are quite divided at the time of deciding what they believe between the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, but it seems that more people are doing it for the second.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of those who participated believed Ford’s testimony with certainty or certainty, and 35% believed Kavanaugh with certainty or certainty.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had probably said a lot or probably a lie in his statement, and 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, allegations made by Ford are currently being investigated by the FBI, and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, has reported The Guardian.
Last week, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford had sworn that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the attack at the age of 17.
Ramirez has alleged that the Supreme Court candidate showed her genitalia at a party when she was a student in Yale in the 1980s.
Who invented the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web, wants to launch a startup aimed at confronting Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid Free Software platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people will have access to the information for that purpose.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee was joking about Inrupt's intention to "take the world into the century."
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historical one."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data repository” or POD.
Contact lists, lists of things to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools can be found.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser, and all in one.
The distinctive feature of the online personal database is that a certain type of information that can be accessed by the user remains entirely in the hands of the user.
“The company is empowering people through data,” he says.
According to executive director John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to put the right resources, processes, and abilities in place to help make Solid accessible to all.
Currently, these are the companies that make up the company: Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, tech developers around the world would be able to create their decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team weren't talking about the need to make a complete change with Facebook and Google from day to day when their business patterns completely change.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to build an ecosystem and commercial energy that will help protect the integrity and quality of Solid's new network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee completely changed when he founded the Internet World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this next era on the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Confessions of a Clergyman with the Victoria Cross during World War I
He was named the only Church clergyman in England to receive the Victoria Crusade as a warrior of World War I, 100 years later.
Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a freelancer, and he never knew he had received the highest British honor award.
Two of his nieces showed a memorial stone at a Rushden parade in Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his colleagues, Michael Vann, said the stone was "very symbolic" to be awarded to his grandfather and showcasing 100 later.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann crossed the Saint-Quentin Canal and led his battalion "before it was very closed and under the constant fire of cannons and machine guns".
He then rushed to the first line of fire, and led the line forward with great reverence until he found a canyon, and threw it on three detached grounds alone.
Vann was killed on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war by a German franchisor.
Michael Vann, 72, said he knew his grandfather's actions "would never have done him, but that gives him great humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up a flower crown after the parade, which was headed by the Brentwood Youth Imperial Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a great honor for them to take part in the parade" and added that "it proves the worship of a real hero that many people will give to him."
MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, but instead put Peppa Pig
Let's say you wake up all night to see the Bellator 206 full of people, and then they won't let you see the main session.
The San Jose cartel had 13 fights, among the six main calendars, and was broadcast live at night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other when the UK spectators left the cover to Peppa Pig.
Some weren’t surprised to find out until the early hours of the morning after waking up.
A follower described the change to the live drawings for children on Twitter as "a bad-looking joke".
"A government law says this content was not suitable for 6:00 a.m., and they had to change it to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's chief marketing and communications chairman, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Bellator's president Scott Coker said that the programming will be reviewed by the UK audience in the future.
"When I think of repetition, I think I can probably fix a lot," Coker said.
“But there are six in the morning on Sunday, and we can’t fix that until our Sunday at the same time.
But we are working to fix it.
Believe me, when the change was made, a lot of messages were going forward and backwards, and they weren't all very pleasant.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
It wasn’t, it was a matter of government.
I'm telling you, it won't happen again next time.
We're going to put five fights on six, as we normally do. We tried to offer more people, and we got into the leg.
It’s unfortunately a situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's 'Littleness' About Sex
The Olympic tracker Tom Daley says he grew up feeling less about sex than others, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to secondary school “that they weren’t all the same.”
Speaking on Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne on Radio 4 said she spoke to others about the rights of homosexuals to "hope."
In addition, he said that being a parent brought him less importance to winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the long-standing program, has taken several months off due to illness.
After appearing completely lost in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "a little bit" for everyone else because society didn't accept the boys and girls he liked."
What he said: “Until today, the feelings that make you feel less and different from others have been the real reasons for the ability and strength to succeed.”
She wanted to prove that she was "something," in her words, because she didn't want to disappoint people when they heard of her sexuality.
The athlete who won two bronze medals in the Olympics has become a high-profile LGTB promoter, and more countries have used their participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand that homosexuality be decriminalized.
He said that he had given his opinion because he felt that he was very fortunate that he could live in an open way without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said he had fallen in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - that he was "surprised."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than her, last year, but said the age difference was not a problem between them.
He said "when you're young and so many things happen to you" - he went to the Olympic Games for the first time at 14 years and died three years later with his father's cancer - that it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has had similar experiences.
The couple became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley has said that he has changed his "whole vision".
"If you asked me last night, 'I have to win a gold domination,' the only thing I had in mind was," he said.
"And, you know, there are things that are more important than gold domes in the Olympics.
“My gold medalist is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said that his father was not accepting his death, and asked for one of the last things he did: whether he wanted to be on the front line with the tickets for the 2012 London Games.
"I couldn't have said, 'You're not going to be on the first line, Dad.'
"I was held in his hand when I stopped breathing and stopped breathing and I did not accept that he was not invincible until he died," he said.
The next day, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics, and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: to sit in front of the audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first song selection—Heather Small’s Proud—which made him feel identified throughout the entire process of preparing for the Olympic Games and still puts him on a chicken hat.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday, 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was not in shape, stayed in the Ryder Cup chair on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record when he plays the 47th game of the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he will need to improve his shape so he doesn't look bad.
The Mickelson brand was breaking for two years, playing for the 12th time in the previous event; however, captain Jim Fury sent to the field in Saturday's fourball and foursome modes.
While in the middle of the action, as it has often been for the United States, he divided the day to be an animator, on the one hand, and on the other, to run the game on the pitch, hoping to rectify his suffering.
He has never been the right driver or the best moment of his career, and the 48-year-old is not the best option for Le Golf National’s competitive dynamics, as the hardest players are taking on the losers.
And even if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will have to face champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday to win four games this week with Tommy Fleetwood rookie.
If the Americans had a good start in 12 matches below four points, Mickelson's match would be decisive.
Fury showed confidence in his man, for he could not say much more.
"He understood very well the paper you had today, gave me a blow on my back, and told me he was going to be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He’s a top athlete and has given these teams a great deal in the past, and this week.
I don’t think I’ve seen two games.
I expected more, but it happened that way, and we thought we should act that way.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record as the player who played the most in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could be the end of his professional career in the Ryder Cup, which has never reached his own brand again.
Mickelson has won 18 times, lost 18 times, and stopped seven times, but according to Furyken, he has brought something to the team that is unprecedented.
"He's laughing, and he's sarcastic and stubborn, and he's always joking with people, and it's great to have him there," he says.
"The young players have enjoyed playing against him this week, and it's been fun to see.
“He does more than just play.”
Thomas Bjorn, the captains of the European team know that the big advantage can disappear immediately
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows by experience that despite having a big advantage in the last day's singles swap, the Ryder Cup can easily make the situation miserable.
In 1997, he made his Danish debut in Valderrama, where, at Seve Ballesteros' command, his team had a five-point advantage over the United States, but they won the championship with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 points.
"I'm constantly reminding myself that we've won a big overall advantage in Valderrama and in the winter, and we've lost to Brooklin, although we've had a big advantage," Bjorn said (in the photo), after winning Classes 5 and 3 of 2018 on Friday, Friday, September 6, and Thursday, September 10, at National Golf.
So history tells us both to me and to all my teammates that this is not over yet.
We're going to be full tomorrow.
We’ll go to the gym and try to do everything right.
Nothing is decided until the points are in the tree.
Our goal is to win the trophy, and that’s what we’ll focus on.
“As I’ve always said, I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we know well what’s on the opposite side: the best players in the world.”
Happy with the achievements his players have made in a difficult golf course, Bjorn also said: "I never want to move anything forward.
Tomorrow's tomorrow.
It’s the turn of the individual tomorrow, and that’s something else.
It’s great to be with a member when things go well, but when you’re alone, each golfer has to prove his or her full abilities.
That’s exactly the message you need to convey to the players: the best you’ll get out tomorrow.
Now, forget your friends, they too have to do their best.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Fury of the other team is in the fact that his players will play better as a singles member, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three out of four points.
Fury himself appeared on both sides of these last-day shifts, as a winning team member of Brookline, and later lost to the European team, when Europeans made the "Mediterranean Miracle."
"I remember all the words," he said, when he asked the 1999 captain, Ben Crenshaw, how he encouraged the players the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to keep the lead from the start, like in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the other side has the advantage, there is a lot of pressure in these matches.
We’ve decided on that list of players, and we’re going to do a great job tomorrow.”
Thomas has a job to do the opposite, and Rory McIlroy will be in the final match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the top-half Europeans.
"I have chosen that branch in that order, because they are in a way to do the whole way," Bjorn said of the selected individuals.
The construction of the new German warship has been delayed.
The new German naval fragata was to be requested in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warships, but will not be built until at least next year, as the systems are flawed and costing more and more, according to local media.
The request of the warship "Rheinland-Pfalz" (the main vessel of the new battalion of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class) has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman named Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was to be boarded in 2014, but the following dozens of problems prevented it from being able to complete this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels requested by the Marines in 2007 will replace old Bremen-class fragatas.
It appears that a powerful canyon will have features against aircraft and ship missiles and technology to carry out hidden actions (e.g., reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures).
In addition, it will also have longer maintenance capacity: new fragatas can last up to two years outside the original ports.
However, due to the continuous delays, warships with state-of-the-art technology (which Germany aims to project its capabilities) will remain obsolete until they enter service, says Die Zeit newspaper.
The poorly finished F125 fragata made a lot of noise in the media last year, as the German army officially rejected the ship's request, and returned to the Hannover Blohm & Voss ship.
It was the first time the Marines had returned a ship to the ship after delivering it.
The reasons for the return are not known, but the German media mentioned serious "software and hardware errors" as a result of which the warship was said to be unusable for use in combat missions.
Software failures were particularly important, the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by 120 sailors, half of them in the Bremen-class fragatas.
In addition, the ship is too heavy and, as a result, its performance is greatly reduced, and it is more difficult for the mariner to add novelties in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate destroys the double-class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, there is also a problem with the price of the entire project (including crew training).
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3,100 million, out of the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,200 it would have to cost at first.
The problems with new fragatas are even more important in the face of warnings that the German navy is decreasing its capacity.
A few months ago, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the navy was "depleting the usable ships".
According to the representative, the problem has become more and more so, since there has been no substitute after the old ships have been withdrawn.
Baden-Wuerttemberg did not allow a Fragat of the class to be in the navy.
Saguzar’s secret life has been observed by the National Trust.
A new study has been conducted on a mountainous terrain in Scotland to learn how saguzars use the landscape to search for food.
They are in the process of obtaining more information on the behaviour of these particular flying birds, in order to be able to better specify the activities to protect them in the future.
Scientists from the Scottish National Trust (NTS) will be following up on the common nano-saurus and sopranos, as well as the big-eared and Daubenton-saurus, in the Inverewe gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations, and the activities that the saguzars will carry out throughout the season will be followed.
UK Health System (NHS) workers will also carry out mobile screenings with handheld detectors.
When experts perform sound analysis of all recording devices, the frequency of saguzar’s calls will be known, as well as what each species does.
Then, a map of the habitat and a report will be made to obtain a detailed picture of the landscape scale of the saguzar's behavior.
Rob Deware, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, believes that the most important habitat areas of saguzars will be determined, as well as how each species uses them.
This information will determine the advantages of habitat treatment work; for example, the creation of beetles, and how to best maintain forests for sagus and related species.
The population of Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom declined significantly over the course of the century.
They are at risk of construction and development, and this affects the habitat and loses its habitat.
Wind turbines and chimpanzees are also at risk, as well as papers for catching ivory, chemical treatments for building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
The squirrels aren’t really blind.
However, as they hunt at night, they are more useful to them than the ears, when catching catches.
They use a sophisticated observational location technique to combine flight tracking obstacles and obstacles.
The NTS is responsible for 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of Scotland, and takes the saguzars very seriously.
He has appointed ten skilled experts, who regularly carry out inspections, examinations of the bones, and, sometimes, rescues.
In fact, the organization has created the first and only shrimp reserve in Scotland in the lands of Dumfries and Galloway Threave, where eight of the ten shrimp species in Scotland live.
As David Thompson, the land manager, says, land is the best land for them.
"We've got a great deal for Threaven saguzar," he said.
"We have old trees, and many years old trees; the habitat is very suitable.
However, there are still many things about the unknowns about the sagus, so thanks to the work we do here and in other lands, we will understand what they need to be healthy."
Thompson has pointed out that it is very important to verify that there is a sagus before maintenance work is carried out; for if a single maternity leave is annulled, 400 sagus and kume can be killed, and perhaps the entire local population will disappear.
Saguzars are protected by species, and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them, as well as to destroy their habitats.
Elisabeth Ferrelle, the representative of Saguzar's protection organization, has asked the general population for help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about the sagus, and we don't know how many species are living with us."
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations while his lawyers are detaining the German magazine
The rape allegations against him are “fake news,” Cristiano Ronaldo said, and those who have done so only want to “promote publicity” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which has published the complaint.
Portuguese and Juventus prosecutor Kathryn Mayorga has been charged with rape in Las Vegas in 2009.
After that, he allegedly paid him <0x24>375,000 in exchange for keeping the incident secret, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
A few hours later, he released a live video on Instagram for 142 million followers on the platform of 33-year-old Ronaldo, who said the accusations were “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no and no.
What we say today is fake news," said the footballer who won the Golden Ball five times in front of the camera.
“They want to get publicity by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get fame by my name, but that's what happens in my career.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sell Der Spiegel as accusations, which are said to be "unauthorized publication of suspicions affecting privacy".
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek damages "as far as the severity of the rape is concerned, which has been one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a Las Vegas Palms hotel and casino suite.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's bedroom, where he allegedly raped from a distance, according to Clark County District Court documents in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo was "a good man in 99 percent," but that he was "failing in one percent."
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that the couple had sex, but that he was allowed to have sex.
Mayorga also said that she had visited the police and had taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but that later on, she had reached an out-of-court agreement because "repressants were terribly frightened" and "concerned that she was publicly humiliated".
A 34-year-old woman said she wanted to revoke the deal because she was suspected of being traumatized.
When the alleged attack occurred, Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and went to the big Italian Juve team last summer as a result of a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' the loss of automakers
The United Kingdom "will be forever sorry" to stop being the head of automakers after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He also said it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal, it would stop production at the factory in Burnaston (around Derby).
"We need a deal," Clark said.
Japan's automaker said a no-deal "Brexit" could lead to job losses due to delays in customs.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"We believe that if the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement by the end of March, production of our factory will be halted," said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota Burnaston.
Other UK automakers (such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also said they are not afraid of how cross-border trade will work without a deal from the European Union.
BMW, for example, has said it will shut down its Mini factory for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of automakers is the risks surrounding the supply chain if the "Brexit" is implemented without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is "temporary" and the parts arrive every 37 minutes, both from UK and EU suppliers, for cars created as requested.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, food losses could occur at borders and, consequently, delays and inadequacies of parts.
It would not be possible for Toyota to store the inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire factory; as a result, production would have to be stopped.
According to Clarke, Theresa May's "Chequers" plan for future contacts with the European Union "is specifically designed to prevent these customs checks."
"It is necessary to have a deal. We want the best deal, not only to ensure the current success, but also in the future to take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4 on Today.
"In addition to Toyota, other manufacturers have proven that it is imperative that the supply chains that are very successful continue to do so."
Toyota has not been able to say how long the production will be halted, but has warned that, in the long run, there are additional costs that could reduce the competitiveness of the medium factory and, as a result, the job could be lost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the factory coordinator of the Unite syndicate, said the member is becoming more and more concerned: "I have experience that if we lose these jobs, we will not be able to recover them.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for the future of relations with the European Union."
Trump and Rosenstein’s meeting could be postponed again, according to the White House.
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein's general tax deputy could be "deferred to another week" as the dispute over candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Robert Mueller oversees the work of special adviser Rosenstein, who is investigating the influence of Russia in the U.S. election, the ties between Trump’s supporters and Russia, and the alleged obstruction of justice by the president.
Trump has resigned his general fiscal deputy and will endangere Mueller's independence in the last few months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had considered carrying a hidden microphone to record Trump's conversations, as well as removing the president from office in accordance with Article 25 of the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
However, he went to the White House on Monday, saying that he would renounce the information as it was released.
Instead, he said he would have a meeting with Trump at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Thursday.
Trump has said he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but he has later postponed a meeting with the Senate Judicial Commission to avoid conflict, which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation to investigate charges against Kavanaugh, which led to further delays in the Senate's vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said, "There is still no date set; it may be this week, but I would understand that it will be delayed another week, given all that is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see; I always like to keep the press on top of the news.”
Some journalists will not agree very much with this statement, as Sanders has not given a press conference on the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked the reason for this.
According to Sanders, the lack of press conferences has not been that television journalists are "handicaps", but that he has said, "I agree that they are bigger."
He also said that the relationship between Trump and the press will continue to grow.
"The president has a lot more questions-answers than his predecessors," he said, adding, without mentioning the evidence: "We have verified these statistics."
Sanders said the press will continue to do so, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president directly, that's much better than asking me.
We are trying to do this a lot, and you have seen that we have done it a lot over the last few weeks, and that will replace the press conference when we allow us to talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House, when he takes part in open sessions, or in press conferences when the dignitaries visit.
He doesn’t usually do his own press conferences.
The U.S. president has revealed the possible reason for this this week in New York, when he made a spontaneous appearance in front of the journalists gathered there and at times curious.
United Kingdom health secretary writes a letter to European Union workers working in the Scottish NHS system because of concerns about "Brexit"
The health secretary has written to European Union staff working at the Scottish NHS health system to thank the country as a whole and to ask them to stop there after Brexit.
The UK has been suspended for less than six months to leave the European Union, the Scottish parliamentary Jeane Freeman said.
The Scottish government has already agreed to take over the cost of applications for "settled status" for EU citizens working in public services.
This is what Freeman said in his letter: "Throughout the summer, negotiations on Brexit have progressed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and a decision is expected to be reached in the autumn.
However, the UK government has broadened preparations for a possible exit without treaty.
I know it's a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate that I take great care of the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
European Union workers, as well as outsiders, bring valuable experience and skills, and improve the work of health services at the mercy of patients and the communities we serve.
"Scotland's home is undoubtedly ours, and we hope to live with us."
Emergency surgery after Christion Abercrombie suffered a head injury
Christion Abercrombie's Tennessee State Tigers have operated on an emergency axle after sustaining a head injury on Saturday after losing to Vanderbilt Commodores on 31 and 27, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, said the player suffered a head injury a little earlier than the mid-match break.
"He landed at the airport next door and lost his cone," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel have given Abercrombie oxygen in the gang, and they have carried out a study to conduct a more in-depth medical examination.
A representative of the Tennessee State team in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris of WSMV that he had been discharged from the operation and was in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
"They haven't given any details yet about the motor injury or its severity," he said, and they're trying to determine when the injury occurred in the Tennessee State team.
He is in his second year with the Abercrombie elastic reddish, and his first season after transferring from Illinois to Tennessee State.
He made five plaques on Saturday before leaving the game, with a total of 18 plaques throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on tin when they buy tin in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on tin when they buy tin in the United Kingdom, and this amount will be used to help those who are homeless, in line with the conservative party's plans.
This strategy aims to neutralize the success that Corbyn has had in attracting young voters
For those who do not pay taxes in the UK, there will be a tax increase on tinbre
Public Altxor says they will raise an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on tin when they buy tin in the UK, and it will be used to help those who are homeless, Theresa May said today.
This strategy aims to neutralize the success that Corbyn has had in attracting young voters; Corbyn has pledged to provide affordable housing and tax those with the most income.
Persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom will have an increase in the tax on tinbre, and the additional amount collected will be used for the efforts of the government to reduce the number of people sleeping in the street.
The surcharge, which is the addition of the current tax on tinbre (including the high tax on second-family homes purchased for rent and for rent two years ago), can reach up to three percent.
According to the Public Prosecutor, they will raise an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the outdoors built in London are purchased by those who do not live in the UK; as a result, prices are rising and it is harder for those who want to enter the housing market for the first time.
The country's rich areas, especially the capitals, have become "mamu-cities" because foreign settlers spend most of their time outside the city.
Boris Johnson, to help young people buy their first home, comes after requesting a reduction in tax on tinbre, precisely this new policy.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the prices of unused and unpurchased land, and asked May to put aside a share of reasonable-priced housing to fix Britain's "residential crisis."
Corbyn, for his part, has presented some attractive housing reforms, including rent control and homelessness.
In addition, he wants to give the municipalities more power to build more homes.
"I said last year that I would dedicate my presidency to the renewal of the British dream, to improving the lives of each new generation.
This means that you think the housing market is fixed.
Britain’s doors will always be open to those who want to live, work and organize their lives there.
However, it is not as easy for people who do not live in the UK as it is for British citizens who work hard for foreign companies to buy homes.
For the majority of people, the dream of owning a home has gone a long way, and the dignity of those who have to sleep on the street is still here.”
Jack Ross: "Being a coach for the Scottish team is my biggest challenge"
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, said he was "the greatest of his time" ever to be the coach of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which is third in League One, with three points from the first position.
This air came to the stadium as Stadium of Light, the team of St Mirren returned to the Scottish Premiership in the season following their return.
“I wanted to work as a player for my country.
I won a B League trophy, and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But when I was little, I saw Scottish matches with my father in the Hampdens, and I always wanted to come back.
I would only have had the opportunity to manage the club.”
Among Sunderland's former coaches are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa, the former head of Athletic, said he was not nervous about coming after such great names; for he had refused to offer training to the Barnsley and Ipswich Town teams.
"To measure success, I'm going to have to ask myself, 'Can I go back to the Premier League?'
"Given the structure and facilities of the club, it should be in the Premier League, no doubt," he said.
"It won't be easy to get there, but I don't see myself as a success if I can't do it."
Ross has only been coaching for three years, serving as assistant to Dumbarton's boss for a time and serving as one of Hearts' coaches for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa recover after dropping to the third level, and thanks to him, he moved from being lucky to be the champion of the St Mirren level downwards in the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he was in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic teams.
"It was a real journey for me, perhaps," he said of taking care of Alloa.
"I really thought that being a coach was the best function for me than being a player.
It’s strange to say that, because I was a good player, I had a good way of life, and I had some important moments of fame.
But it can be hard to play.
You have to carry a lot of things every day.
I still have to endure the stress and pressure of the work, but I like it as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to be a coach, and now that I’m doing that, I feel more comfortable on my face than ever before.”
The full interview will be broadcast on September 30 (Sunday) at Radio Scotland’s Sportsound session, between 12:00 and 13:00 (BST)
It’s five and a half hours on Saturday to have a drink, according to a survey.
Thanks to the summer heat boiler, UK pub revenues have increased a lot, but the pressure for restaurants has increased.
Sales of pubs and bars have risen by 2.7 per cent, but the restaurant has fallen by 4.8 per cent, according to data.
Peter Martin, a CGA consultant who collects the data, says: "As the weather has been a constant hit, and the England team has been more than thought at the World Football Championships, since the July data is higher than the June data, where the prices are higher than those in the pub.
Even though sales of restaurants fell by 1.8 in June, they were even worse in July.
Pubs and bars specializing in drinks have also had much better performance, and their rise has been greater than the decline in restaurants’ sales.
Pubs that specialize in dinner have also suffered in the sunset, but not as much as restaurants.
Apparently, people just want to have a drink.
Sales of pub and tavern drinks increased by 6.6 percent in the last month, while meals fell by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an entertainment and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results are the tracking of the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The influence of weather and social events and sports are the most important factors in terms of sales for outdoor trade.
It is not surprising that restaurants have economic stagnation, and a fall of 4.8 percent in sales from one year to another will cause significant damage, in addition to continuing pressure around the cost.
The long and hot weather is coming for the establishments that specialize in eating in the wrong time, and it's time to see if the moderate temperatures in August will give a calming effect."
The increase in the sales of pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened establishment, was 2.7 percent in July, with the expansion of the chains slowed.
The Coffer Peach Tracker index monitors sector sales for UK pub, bar and restaurants, collecting and analyzing performance data from 47 operator groups. These operator groups, together, account for more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion in revenue from that sector.
One in five children has accounts that they hide from their parents on social media.
One in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers on social networks, according to a survey
In a survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils, it was possible to see that “false Instagram accounts” have risen.
Because of this news, the fear of whether sexual content is being published has increased.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “star” account that parents can see
But one in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have accounts that they hide from adults on social networks.
In a survey of 20,000 secondary school students, it has been possible to see that "Fake Instagram Accounts" have increased a lot (the photo sharing website is Instagram).
Because of this news, the fear of whether or not sexual content is being published has increased.
Twenty percent of students say that they have a clean "we" account that parents can see, but they also have private accounts.
A mother unwittingly found her 13-year-old daughter's secret web site, where a teenager told others, "Give me a drink."
According to a study by UK Digital Awareness UK companies and independent schools (HMCs), 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, half of whom admit they have private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It's troubling that teenagers are tempted to create secret online spaces that parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "Speaker of Athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle, the former executive director of the Scottish Athletics Committee, has been appointed at this year's general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Scotsman Doyle is the most award-winning athlete, and director Ian Beattie has said that with this change they have a great opportunity to take advantage of the wide experience he has had internationally in the last decade.
"Eilidh has tremendous respect for Scotland, the UK and the athletic community around the world, and we know that being on the committee will be very useful for Scottish athletics," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm looking forward to being a spokesman for the athlete, and I hope to make a big contribution to the sport in Scotland."
He won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and has a total of four gold medals. Today, he is a BBC narrator. Recently, he lost his ability to walk due to a past ischemical heart attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a heart attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me whether or not I would be renewed to see whether or not to what extent.
It was very hard, but I was completely renewed. Again I had to learn to walk, and I have been practicing skills-actions today!
Thank you so much for sending me a message of encouragement!”
An advertisement for a dairy farm that the mother overcame with cows has created contradictory opinions on the Internet
A dairy company has created conflicting opinions on the Internet, compared to cows that are jetted by bulldozers.
To present the so-called “World’s First Silent Milk Release Portable,” Elvie, a technology-providing company for consumers, has released a joke-inspired advertisement in a music video, showing the freedom that new devices dream of milk releasing.
There are four women who really dance in a crowded street with these words and a similar song: "Yes, I write myself, but I don't see the sea," and "Maybe you haven't noticed, but these are not traps, but my tits."
This is the motto: "Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go."
However, this announcement, which the company has published on its Facebook page, has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has created a variety of reactions in the audience. Many have said that it does not take the "terrors" of the dairy industry seriously.
“It has been very bad to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and breastfeed to produce milk, but they steal their bodies for a few days after they are born," said one user.
Elvie breastfeeding can enter discreetly in one of the breastfeeding breasts (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else said this: “Very traumatic, of course, for mom and dad.
But why don’t you use them to advertise a dairy milk-extract that they don’t take away from their children?”
Another man added, “This drink has nothing to do with it.”
Others, on the other hand, have defended the ad, which a woman has admitted to be "a way to explode with laughter."
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
I felt like I was a cow when I was out of milk.
It’s crazy, but that’s what it’s all about.
“It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another commented: "It's a fun drink, because the milk-extracting breastfeeding (often in the workplace or in the room) feels like "cows."
He has no intention of overturning or prosecuting the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, women show that they have been carrying breastfeeding in dancing.
Many women who are breastfeeding feel like cows in the campaign.
However, the milking of Elvie is completely silent and has no cables or tubes. It can be carried discreetly on one of the breasts of the puppy, so that the females can move as they wish, be in the arms of the infants or be able to get out on the street.
Ana Balarin’s partner and CEO Mother commented: “Elvie’s dairy production is a very revolutionary product and therefore demands a bold and provocative presentation.
With this similarity between breastfeeding women and breastfeeding women, we wanted to highlight the process of breastfeeding and all its challenges, and, in the same way, express the freedom that gives breastfeeding in an entertaining and close manner.
It's not the first time Elvie's milking has attracted attention.
During London Fashion Week, a mother with two children appeared at the supermarket for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been transported quietly to a Texas border camp.
The number of children displaced has increased considerably lately, even though border guards have been slightly lower than the same; one of the reasons for this is that the Trump administration's rhetoric and guidance are harder and it has been more difficult to bring the children to the caretakers.
Up until now, the majority of unpapered immigrants have been their protectors, but now, they are afraid to give a name to protect children, because they may lose the ability to stop in the United States.
The risk increased in June, as the federal authorities said those who wanted to be patrons and other adults who lived in their homes would have to send fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration authority.
Last week, Matthew Albence, one of the U.S. immigration and customs security officials, admitted to the congress that dozens of people who had filed a petition to protect minors had been arrested.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of them had no criminal precedent.
“Almost 80 percent of the people living with or without protection are illegal in our country, and many of them are foreign criminals.
"We're still looking at them," Albany said.
In order to process the situation of children more quickly, officials have created some new rules; according to them, children must appear in court within one month after detection, and not as early as 60 days, according to the protection staff.
Many of them will appear on a videoconferencing call to request legal status for an immigration court.
If they decide that they are not eligible for assistance, they will be deported immediately.
The more time children spend in care centres, the more likely they are to increase their anxiety and depression; as a result, violence or attempts to escape may occur, depending on the protection workers and the system in the last months.
Children's advocates say these concerns are increasing in large facilities such as Tornillo, because as they are so large, there is a greater likelihood of children's problems not being seen.
In addition, they say that if children are brought to the campsite without emotional preparation or a sense of goodbye to friends, the trauma they already have can be exacerbated.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish "occupied powers" to withdraw immediately
At the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem has also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's eighth year of war.
The deputy prime minister, Mouale, said foreign forces are illegally staying in Syria on grounds of fighting terrorism and will be "treated accordingly".
"They have to leave the country immediately and without any conditions," he said on the committee.
Moualem said the Syrian war on terrorism had “almost ended,” with 360,000 people dead since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes.
He said Damascus would "continue to fight in the sacred battle" "until we clear all the territories of Syria" from both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly Kurdish forces against President Bashar al-Assad and Syrian Arabs training and advising.
France, on the other hand, has 1,000 troops in the country that was destroyed by the war.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Mouale has said that there are adequate conditions for their return, and has accused some "western countries" of spreading the "irrational fear" that drives refugees to remain outside.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable these returns," he said.
“It’s only humanitarian issues that are being politicized.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide aid to rebuild Syria until they reach a political agreement to end the war between Assad and the opposition.
Recently, Russia and Turkey have reached an agreement to establish a refugee zone in the last fortress of the rebels in Idlib, which, according to UN diplomats, is an opportunity to foster political dialogue.
The Russian-held Syrian forces were able to carry out a large-scale attack in this province of three million people, which prevented the agreement between Russia and Turkey.
However, Moualem has said the agreement has a clean "days" agreement, and has indicated that military action will target jihadists, including the Nusra front fighters associated with al-Qaeda, who will be "disappointed".
The UN secretary-general of Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new assembly will soon be held between members of the government and the opposition, to start a post-war constitution, as well as to open the way for elections.
Moualem has set certain conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the meeting, saying the assembly's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and noting that no one else should intervene.
Why will Trump win for the second time?
Following this logic, Trump will win a re-election in 2020 if (as many Democratic viewers probably expect) an impeachment process or scandals do not end before his presidency is needed.
It would be “the most dramatic end of a presidency.”
At the moment, the audience doesn’t seem tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s most-time viewership has nearly doubled to reach 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC’s chain has tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News, for its part, has 2.4 million viewers in that hour, which is 1.7 million up four years ago, according to Nielsen’s data. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has the largest cable TV viewer in the world, and has reached 3.5 million subscribers per night.
"It's like a fire that attracts people, because we want to understand what's going on," said Neal Baer, director of ABC's "Designated Survivor" session. Baer's session is about a cabinet chief who becomes president after an attack on the middle of the Capitol.
"Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club," ("Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club") is another theory by Nell Scovel.
Before the 2016 election, he was in a taxi in Boston.
He said he would vote for Trump.
Scovel asked the tax.
"Because he said he was acting like a fool," said Scovel.
There’s also time for entertainment.
Unlike anything else on television, stories from Washington are about the future of the abortion law, the reunification of immigrant families, and the health of a world-class economy.
Only high-priority spectators have the option to disconnect.
However, if you give up six hours of information to see a debate of experts on a variety of topics: how Bob Woodward used "deep precedents" to write the book "Fear" in a <0x24>15,000 postage stamp by Paul Manafort, with a "The Ostrich-Filled Jacket" in the Washington Post.
At least I won't look at Super Mario again in the same way.
Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars" show, tells the changing character and argument of Trump's show (to argue with the national football league, to summon Kim Jong-un) that he feels a 'reality' show.
You can't lose a part, otherwise you'll be left behind.
When I met Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees and was sunny at his house on the north coast of Kaua'i, but he was watching MSNBC inside while CNN was recording.
He could not decipher from television, especially now, that Brett Kavanaugh had to appear before the Senate Judicial Commission, and that the future of the Supreme Court was in danger.
"When I was doing these cheebre televisions a long time ago, people were saying it was the end of Western civilization," Fleisse told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seemed like they were right."

External money is entering bar bars in the U.S. Congress's equal midterm elections
It is not surprising to know that in Pennsylvania's 17th district, money is entering bar bars, as congress districts have been reorganized, and as a result, two headlines are in the race to get the same seat.
The border was recently reorganized in that district around Pittsburgh by Democratic Party representative Conor Lamb, who won his aula in special elections in another district.
Another title holds Lambe, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is distinguished by the 17th district.
In January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the district boundaries were being manipulated against what the Constitution says in favour of the Republicans, and as a result, the borders were properly defined.
This new district competition has resulted in a narrow competition for campaign financing in the main sources of funding of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known for his short-lived win in Pennsylvania as he won the special election for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania in March.
In the last decade, he was a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point advantage.
According to political historians, Democrats have a bit of an advantage.
The U.S. considers punishing El Salvador for being on China’s side, but then reverses the decision
Diplomats have said that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, which Washington has hardly asked to back down.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and was the owner of a hotel in Panama, until his partners decided to drop the Trump organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, following "new decisions to stop Taiwan's recognition," said a spokeswoman for the department, Heather Nauert, a month ago.
However, penalties were considered to be imposed only against El Salvador, which received <0x24>140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including to control drug trafficking, promote development and help the economy.
The proposed penalties include a reduction in economic aid and specific interim cuts, which would be very damaging to the Central American nation because of its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a summit conference on security and economic prosperity, which was aimed at following a similar meeting held last year, and immigrants attempted to reach the United States.
But in mid-September, the chief administration officials had cleared their intentions to hold the conference, thereby giving El Salvador the consideration of imposing penalties.
Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to attend the conference that changed in mid-October, a sign of the importance that the administration gives to the meeting, diplomats say.
The three U.S. officials have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in secret without a Washington message or harsh punishment.
A spokesman for the White House of Bolton has refused to make statements about the details of the debate given by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who have agreed to keep the anonymity of the internal debates.
An analyst who has a close relationship with the administration and has also spoken anonymously has confirmed what they said.
Learning the history
Robert Mueller's report on whether Trump has obstructed justice will soon be released, as there is much evidence of this in the public view.
In addition, Mueller said he was also investigating whether the Trump campaign was a friend in the attack on Russia in the U.S. election.
If the majority of Congress changes side by side, Trump will have to give instructions as he prepares to appear before the voters (and, if necessary, a jury of his own equals) once again.
There are many conditions for this, however, and I don’t mean Trump’s inevitability, not even Trump’s European counterpart.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and according to them, the length of the conflict will be determined.
In 1938, the German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, if the Western countries had supported it and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and then we lost the opportunity to avoid the sarcasm of the following years.
We are surrounded by such points of inflexion in history, which have accelerated or delayed the necessary progress of democracy.
The U.S. is facing such a number of inflection points at the moment.
What do we do if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein's general tax deputy? It's Roseinst, exactly, who controls everything that happens with Mueller's investigation.
Rosenstein's job has been at risk since this newspaper announced last year that he had suggested that the president be silently recorded, and that the president had stated that he was inadequate for his position.
Rosenstein says what the Times said was wrong.
"How do we respond if the FBI has not been fully or fairly investigated about Brett Kavanaugh, or if he has received a conviction to be a judge of the Supreme Court, even though credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony against him have been made?
And, above all, will we vote in a way that will require Trump to be accountable in the midterm elections?
If we don’t pass these tests, the winter will be red for democracy.
But I really think we'll get over them, based on what I've been teaching in Prague.
Our mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and the Nazi regime itself deported to Auschwitz, where my embassy was occupied.
He came out alive, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he drew a swastika on a table and asked me to light a Sabbath candle.
With this legacy, how can I not be wise to look to the future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans feels good against Rapid Vienna
Rapid Vienna will host the Rangers on Thursday. If the Austrians win, they know that they will remain in the best possible position for qualifying for the Europa League G team after an exciting match with Villarreal in Spain a few weeks ago.
The midfielder Graham Dorrans could not make his first appearance in the season with Villarreal until the 2nd and 2nd equations, but the Rangers believe he can use this as a trampoline to get better things.
"It was a good result, a good draw for Villarreal," said the 31-year-old player.
“We played to achieve something, and we ended up getting a point.
Maybe we could have a win-win draw in the end, but it's a result of the equation, if necessary.
In the first half, they prevailed, and in the second, we were the bosses.
Thursday night will be very important for the European Championships.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult, because they have had a good result in the last game. However, the spectators are on our side, and I am in the process of moving forward and getting a positive result.
Last year was a tough year; I had injuries and there were changes in the club, but at the moment there is a positive environment.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying a lot; the training is also good.
I’m going to go ahead to forget about the previous season and succeed.”
Women are extremely concerned that there is a problem that has to do with their retirement savings.
Participants in the survey knew what kind of care they wanted to have, but very few gave their news to family members.
Half of the respondents who participated in the Nationalwide survey said they had spoken to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 of them have spoken to their children about it.
"We want a family member to wait for us, but we don't dare to ask," said Holly Snyder, chairman of the Nationalwide Insurance Company.
Here are my first impressions.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: the family will not be ready to take care of you if you don’t ask for it first.
Work with a counselor and family to agree on where and how you want to receive it, as these options will depend on the cost of care.
Ask a counselor for help: a counselor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
You have more than one option to finance long-term care, including: the usual long-term care insurance, the hybrid insurance that allows you to pay your care expenses in full and the insurance that can be paid with your own money at the time, if you have that money.
Clear Legal Documents: Forget Legal Conflicts.
Choose a reliable person to take care of your health; likewise, make sure that the professionals will take care of you as you wish if you are not able to ask for it.
Also, ask a lawyer to take care of your finances.
Choose a trusted person to make financial opportunities on your behalf and, if you are not able to do so, make sure you pay invoices.
Don’t forget the details: Let’s say that your parents are older and that one of them has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications or allergies?
Write down these details to be prepared for a written plan.
"The finances are at stake, but what are the doctors?" asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Think about that too.”
A man was shot with an air gun in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot with an air gun after he left the party and was returning home.
The victim was 40 years old and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, the shoulder, and the hand.
The police described the shooting as "deep" at 2:30 p.m. (UK Summer Time).
The victim did not see the attacker.
There were no injuries, but the police asked for the help of the witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of an earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll will rise, officials said.
The communication systems have been cut off, soaring agents have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala government, which is the area closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, north of Pallu.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here is some important information about the city of Palu and the government of Donggala on the Sulawesi Islands:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, and is located at the end of a narrow western coastal bay on the island of Sulawesi; in 2017 it had about 379,800 inhabitants.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, on the other hand, is a government that covers an area of more than 300 km (180 miles) of Sulawesi's northwest coast.
The government, which is the province's administrative district, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of the central Sulawesi province is based on fishing and agriculture, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nike's meat trade is also important in the province, but Morowalin is mostly concentrated on the coast of the opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management, Paluk and Donggala have suffered a number of tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996 another tsunami occurred in the western part of Dongguan, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismic area known as the "Pacific Flame Belt", which is why it is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
On December 26, 2004, a major earthquake struck the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra, and a tsunami struck 14 countries, affecting 226,000 people on the entire Indian Ocean coast, more than half in Aceh.
2005: Between the end of March and the beginning of April, several powerful earthquakes occurred on the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed in Nias Irlan, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake occurred in southern Java (the most populous island in Indonesia), and caused a tsunami. The tsunami severely hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake occurred near Padang, the southern capital of Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake occurred on one of the islands near Sumtra, causing a maximum of 10-metre tsunami, resulting in the destruction of dozens of villages and the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake occurred in the government of Acehe Pidie Jaya, bringing disaster and fear, as people recalled the destruction caused by the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
There was no tsunami at the time, but more than 100 people were killed in the building.
2018: A number of major earthquakes occurred among tourists on the Indonesian island of Lombok, and more than 500 people were killed, especially in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and many tourists were temporarily unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, Alaska’s oldest son, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, born in Wasila, Alaska, was arrested for being suspicious of a case of domestic violence, for obstructing a case of domestic violence and for opposing authority, according to reports released by the Alaska State Troopers Division on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known woman started calling the police to report the alleged crime, Palin took off her phone.
According to KTUUR, the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility is located in Palin, a preventive prison and a <0x24>500 loan.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when he made the allegation, he said that he was "unquestionably innocent", as the network reported.
Palin has been charged with three low-level crimes, with a maximum sentence of one year and a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He has also been charged with a B-level mild crime, which could be punished with a one-day prison sentence and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
At the moment, the case is in the hands of the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic attacks, of interfering with the allegations of domestic violence and of having a gun in his pocket.
As the girl said, she gave him an extreme.
When her son’s attitude was linked to the post-traumatic stress disorder caused by Iraqi experiences, Sarah Palin received harsh criticism in 2016.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed on Friday after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the middle of Sulawesi, which is the capital of Indonesia in the northeastern part of Jakarta.
Various videos that show the moment of impact on social networks are rotating.
In fact, it was a beach festival in the city of Palu, where hundreds of people were there when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal Prosecutor Wants Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutor wants the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City; the last time such a sentence was imposed in the state for a federal crime was in 1953.
Saipov, 30, used a rented truck at Home Depot to attack the West Side Highway in South Manhattan, before carrying out all the pedestrians and bicycles during the October attack.
In order to justify the death case, Saipov must prove that he had killed eight of these people "in a nutshell" and that he had seriously wounded several people "in a nutshell", according to the death penalty plan presented in New York City.
According to the legal documents, it would be possible to impose the death penalty in two cases.
The attack occurred and a few weeks later, a large federal jury charged Saipov with 22 cases, including eight murder charges in favour of organized crime, which the federal prosecutor used in cases of organized crime, and a motor vehicle-connected vehicle-container.
The prosecution said the attack had to be "pre-thought-out and planned" because Saipov had committed it with "cruelty", he described it as such.
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov's injuries, injuries and losses were caused by the family and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernano Diego Memiza and Pagnurra.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the New York City South Council last tried a case of death penalty.
At the time, Khalid Barnes was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In a federal case in New York, the last time the death penalty was imposed was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergers were sent to the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to legal documents, Uzbekistan’s Saipov did not show any reluctance in the days and months following the attack.
The police said that they did not feel bad about what they had done to the investigators.
According to the allegations, the inspiration for the attack was seen on the mobile video of the ISIS organization, Saipov told officials.
According to the police, he also requested that we put the flag of the ISIS organization in the hospital room.
As for the 22-year-old, he declared himself innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who is in charge of replacing Saipov, said they have taken "a big deal" with the fiscal decision.
"In our opinion, instead of accepting a conviction for life imprisonment without the possibility of being released, the decision to apply for the death penalty will only prolong the trauma to those affected by these incidents," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously demanded that the prosecutor not demand the death penalty.
Conservative parliament says Nigel Farage should be responsible for Brexit negotiations <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Nigel Farage has ordered the "mobilization of the people's army" in protest at the Conservative Party's conference.
The former leader of the UKIP party has said that politicians should "feel the warmth" of Eurosceptics, and parliamentarians of Theresa May have proposed it to be responsible for EU negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told Birmingham's March participants that the UK "would be out" if Mr Farage was now Brexit secretary.
But Conservatives in favor of staying have organized a protest against Brexit in the city, and Mrs May highlighted the challenge: re-friending fully divided chains.
Prime Minister Chequers is trying to keep the commitment plan going, but in the meantime he is undergoing attacks in favour of Brexit, in favor of staying and in the EU.
The Allies believe that he will move forward and try to reach an agreement with Brussels that such reactions will be left aside, and that he will force Eurosceptics and Labour to decide between his offer or "chaos".
Mr. Bone told his supporters of the Leave Means Leave demonstration that he wanted "chequers to be fired".
He also stated that he had to work with Mr. Farage and that he had to be responsible for the Brussels negotiations.
"If we were responsible, we'd be out there now," he said.
Wellingborough's MP added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to fire the Chequers."
In expressing opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be in the service of anyone.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the 2016 vote that had changed public opinion since: "The fact that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is a lie."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party and pro-Brexit, went on the march, explaining this to the news outlets: "I only say this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is not known among the citizens, the opposition will not vote for him, it is not known among our peers, nor is it known among our activists who push the streets and make it possible for us to win elections.
Let go of the chequers and start listening.”
Addressing Ms. May, she added: "The prime ministers, in order to continue to work, have to keep their word.
Farage told those who took part in the demonstration that politicians should be forced to "feel warm" if they are going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know 'we won't let them out with them'.
Addressing an audience full of memories, he added: "I want you to feel warm to our political class who is betraying Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the army of our citizens in the Brexit era, and we will not rest until the UK becomes independent and autonomous and proud.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through the city center in Birmingham before a two-hour demonstration took place.
Few activists raised anti-Brexit cartels after a group dinner this weekend.
Mr. Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the conservatives because of the security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that ICT systems can function properly, and in Ireland, Canada plus plus chain technology is complete, without frictional borders, free trade without borders," he added.
"It's a lie.
“Brexit is not good,” he added.
Warren will look "attentively" at the possibility of becoming president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will be "considering with great care" the possibility of becoming president after the November election.
The Boston Globe newspaper reported on Saturday that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke of his future in the Massachusetts City Hall in West Massachusetts.
Warren, who is often criticized by President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican State Representative for the Massachusetts; Diehl Trump was the chairman of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is expected that Trump will take over in 2020.
The event that took place in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was the 36th meeting since Trump took office with his members in the municipal assembly.
One of the participants asked him if he wanted to be president.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix the breakdown of our government, and for that, a woman must be in charge."
Suspect Arrested for Shooting of Sims at Louisiana State University
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday for the shooting of Wayde Sims, a baseball player at the University of Louisiana.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11:00 (East Time).
Earlier, he opened the video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying a man who appeared in it.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed on Friday morning near a south-facing university campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head and, as a result, eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the Saturday newspaper via the 247sports network.
Wayde entered a fight to defend a friend, and Simpson shot him.
He was questioned, and admitted that he was there, that he had a gun in his hand, and that he shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
He grew up at the nearly two-metre Sims Baton Rouge, played 32 games of 10 stars in the final season, and played 17.4-minute games, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds on average.
Russian Grand Prix Race: Lewis Hamilton won the world title after winning Sebastian Vettel's team's order
It was clear on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders were either dead or alive in the race since Valtteri Bottas was ranked ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
From the beginning, Bottas had been doing well, and Hamilton almost thrown out to defend his place in the first two rounds, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered boxing, and Hamilton had to get into traffic at the end of the trophy, which should have a direct impact on the race.
The Mercedes went into the boxes a little later, and left behind Vettel, but, after a few more, Hamilton took the lead; for instead, the interior was freed by Ferrari's driver, who held a third place in his post.
That day, Max Verstappen, who turned 21, started the race in the final line of the finish line, finishing seventh in the first lap.
He then remained in the first place for much of the race, and eventually held the tyres to finish the race quickly and to advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
In the end, he entered boxing in the 44th, but was unable to live the rhythm in the eight eight remaining, and Raikkonen took the fourth place.
It’s not an easy day; Valtteri has done a great job throughout the weekend, and he’s been really honest.
The team has done a great job on anyone else,” Hamilton said.
They were inadequate.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein in a demonstration on Saturday, accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment for not filing Christine Blasey Ford's own letter.
When he spoke at a West Virginia demonstration, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judicial Committee; instead, he said that what is happening in the Senate is "bad, false, and misleading" people.
"The only thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate in the last few days, is that you see anger, that you see people who are angry, that you see people who are angry, that you see people who are evil, false, and lying," he said.
"You see the publications and the filters and they say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter the letter?
Do you remember her answer? Did you filter the letter? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Oh, wait a minute.
No, we have not filtered," he added, imitating the senator's reaction.
In July, Ford sent a letter explaining the details of Kavanaugh's allegations to Feinstein, and filtered out last September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration had taken place in his office.
"I have not concealed Dr. Ford's allegations; I have not filtered his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep it in silence, and I kept it in silence, as he asked."
But that he denied it was not welcome for the president, and he stated this at the demonstration held on Saturday night: "I will tell you what: they were inappropriate.
It may not have been her, but they were the most inappropriate ways I have ever seen.”
The three women accused of inadequate sexual assault with the Supreme Court's defense of the candidate, the president said the allegations are being used by Democrats for their purposes.
"They're ready to do anything to regain power.
They are evil, no matter who they are hurting, who they need to weaken in order to gain power and control,” the president said, according to the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against the Giants in Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered Friday's loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League, winning 5-3 in the second option game in Dundee.
The Giants began winning with two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought equality, but the Giants immediately regained leadership.
Francois Bouchard once again brought Dundee equality, and finally Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals guaranteed him a victory.
It was the third loss in the season's Elite League for the Adam Keefe boys, who lost 2-1 to Belfast's Dundee.
It was the fourth meeting of the two teams' season, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's goal came in the fourth minute, 3:35 minutes, thanks to Kendall McFaull's help, and four minutes later, David Rutherford helped Beauvillier, and he doubled the marker.
It was a live start; in fact, Sullivan scored in the 13:10 minute, Matt Marquardt helped Cownie and he scored in the 15:16 minute before entering the goal.
Dwyer wanted to make sure that the Giants had the marker on his side for the first rest, and, at the end of the first part, he entered his second goal of the night.
But the houses were rearranged and Bouchard brought the equilibrium again by entering the goal at 27:37.
At the end of the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcora worked together to help Nielsen and lead Dundee for the first time in the game, and eventually brought the team a fifth goal and, with him, a victory.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Friday's Milton Keynes.
Aerial Controller Killed Hundreds of Flight Trips to Escape from an Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after hundreds of passengers have been able to make sure that an airplane is properly flown and killed.
More than 800 people have died and many others have disappeared after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Numerous powerful replicas have occurred in the area, and many have been trapped under the rubbish of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues left to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post and leave Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
At the same time, it remained there to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight was properly flown, which was on the track at the time.
He then jumped out of the control room when he saw that it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesia's air navigation spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter in Balikpapan to take it to a larger hospital in Kalimantan, another city.
He left this morning, before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts break when we hear it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death rate will rise to thousands of people, and Indonesia's board of directors to manage the disasters says access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The rate is believed to continue to grow, as many bodies are still under the rubbish, and we have not been able to reach many more," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Mahayana.
A maximum of six-metre-waves have completely destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial airplanes are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "A minute, a full-body ambulance arrives.
It is a clean water.
People are stealing all the food in small markets.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working as quickly as possible to help those who have survived, but we don't know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, explaining to the country's military: "I ask all of you to work night and day to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” she told CNN.
Another earthquake this year also struck Indonesia, which occurred in the city of Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia Airplane Accident: Air Niugini Now Says A Man Is Disappeared In A Lake After Airplane Accident
The airline operating the flight that crashed at a Pacific lake in Micronesia says a man is now missing after 47 passengers and crew evacuated the plane as it was due.
Air Niugini said in a publication that he could not verify that a male passenger was missing until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to journalists who asked for more details about the passenger (such as age or nationality).
Thanks to the local ships, the rest of the passengers and crew were able to be rescued after the plane landed at Chuuk's island airport.
Police said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact order of events is not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. military said the plane crashed next to the track.
A number of witnesses thought the plane had passed the track.
Bill Jaynes told the American passenger that the plane had entered very low.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
According to Jaynes, he and other passengers were able to reach the emergency exits of the plane, which were sinking, through the waters of the war.
He said that they were frightened and that they were in a hurry, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
According to the U.S. military, the help of the fishermen in the improvement of the quay around was also very helpful in the rescue work, for which a fragrant vessel was used to take passengers to the ground before a 30-metre (100-foot) plane sinks into the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents in the last two decades, but not one has been caused by Air Niugini.
Analysts have found the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution deferred the case on Saturday in the recent trial of a man accused of surviving a Mississippi woman.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
In a statement to the jury, the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers used cell phone records to link the movements they made on the night of the death of the woman.
According to Rowlett, the woman had received location data from several mobile phones showing that she was with Tellis Chambers at the time of her death, thus deceiving Tellis' previous confirmation, according to The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
The data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers when Tellis said he was with his friend Michael Sanford; then the police went to Sanford.
Sanford appeared before the judge on Saturday, and testified that he was not in the town that day.
When the prosecutor told Tellis that night that he was in the Sanford truck, he told the truth when he asked him that Sanford was "living" that "the truck was in Nashville."
There is also another inconsistency: Tellis said he knew it two weeks ago when Chambers died.
According to mobile phone records, however, they only met a week ago.
According to Rowlett, after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from the phone.
"It's gone out of life," Hale said.
Defence will begin on Sunday with the finals.
The judge said that the trial will take place on that day.
The High Breed: What is Hip-Hop Consciousness?
A three-year-old hip-hop musician wants to challenge people who have negative opinions about the type of music, and for that, they will fill their music with a positive message.
Bristol's The High Breed group says hip-hop has left behind its early political messages and struggles with social problems.
They want to return to its roots, and make the conscious hip-hop known again.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently seen the revival of such hip-hops in the United Kingdom, through Akala and Lowkey artists, for example.
Another black one?
A New York pediatrician has accused a couple of them of releasing her after a "racist" message.
A New York pediatrician has accused a couple of discriminating against her and dismissing her as a result of a mistake and saying she was "another black" after receiving a message from her mother.
The couple has denied being racist, stating that the allegation is "excessive".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was surprised when Giselle Maurice, a new worker who took care of the children, learned she was black when Maurice arrived home on her first working day in 2016.
"EEEEEEEEEEEZ, BEST BELTZ BAT," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But when she had to send him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice, and again
According to the New York Post, when he noticed the leg swelling, Plasco-Flaxman said he felt "discomfortable" and dismissed Mrs. Maurice, who was an African-American, who was not a good worker and instead hoped that a Filipino pediatrician would be a good worker.
Mrs. Maurice paid Mrs. Maurice for the single day of work, and asked a Uber to take her home.
Now, Maurice has sued the couple and demanded compensation for the damages caused by the dismissal, among others, for <0x24>350 a day for six months; since, although without a contract, they were initially hired to live and care for it at home for six months.
"I want to show you that things like that are not done," he told the Post newspaper on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has denied being racial, and has said that the dismissal of Maurice was meaningful and necessary, because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust him after insulting him.
"My wife didn't want to say anything to her.
It's not racist.
We are not racialists,” Joel Plasco told the Post newspaper.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of a person you have insulted, even if it was because of a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Don't even think about it."
When Plasco explained that the charge was "not for this reason", Plasco said that his wife had been pregnant for two months and that she was "in a difficult state".
“You’re going to look for someone like that?
That’s not a good thing,” the investment banker added.
The legal case is still in progress, and the court of public opinion has quickly sued the couple on social networks, punishing them for their attitude and logic.
Paddington's publisher was afraid that they would like a letter to the readers that spoke to them, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who accepted the book and was born shortly after, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put it in someone's place before it was first published.
It’s very fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
The father was a cameraman in the BBC chain before being inspired to write a children's book thanks to a small toy handle; the daughter said that the father had a positive attitude because of the rejection of his work, and added that the book's nearly 60th anniversary of publication was "dead."
As for Paddington, he said he was "an important member of the family" and that his father was proud of his success.
"He was quiet, and he wasn't proud," he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, that he almost felt like he was one of the sons he had achieved something: you were proud of it, even if it wasn't your own achievement.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was the creation of him and his imagination, Paddington always acknowledged his usual merit.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
As soon as he landed, his daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, but the doctors were unable to do anything to save her life.
"Nad used to say that it was very serious to say, that she didn't think she'd come out," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I received a call from Nad to say that he was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to congratulate him on it.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors gave her the medicines to keep her heart on, and they were slowly leaving her system.
He died a little earlier than I thought, and it was over.
I couldn’t just sit and wait, knowing that everything would start there.
I couldn’t cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to stop.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was sorely distressed by the death of her daughter, flew on the plane with the rest of the passengers, forgetting her discomfort.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I was curled in the head, and the beards fell on me all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I didn't feel sorry for Nad.
He needed to understand my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved me.”
Some unpleasant women have put cartels on a bridge to prevent people from doing anything else on their own
The two women who lost loved ones as a result of the suicide want to avoid the death of more people.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put cartels on a Welsh bridge; these cartels have good messages and phone numbers to get people to ask for help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began having depression, and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney; she said her son had a special gift for cooking, and she had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
It was always said that his smile was shining everywhere.”
But he left work before he died, because he was "in very dark places."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm always worried that there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created some cartels, "that people may know that you can tell what happens to you and that people can help you, even if you are a friend.
Don’t be silent; you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davies have been friends for a long time, and he was also his partner for 15 years when Mark lost his mother and died shortly after.
"He didn't say he was sad, nor was he depressed," he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed his attitude.
On the day of Christmas, the earth was shaken; when the children opened the gifts, they did not even look at them.”
As he said, his death was a great trauma for him, but they have to move forward: "He leaves a little bit of a family.
The land that leaves us.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake after FBI investigation begins
"I thought of it: if we could achieve something like what he asked for, such as a time-limited or time-limited study, maybe we could get a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he would be afraid of being in the fire.
Why didn't the FBI want Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican followers to investigate the case?
Opposite opinion is for time.
There are only five weeks left to run for midterm elections: on November 6th, Republicans are expected to achieve bad results, and, if so, they will start very weakening the men who want to be elected to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush made numerous phone calls to senators, and put pressure on Mr. Kavanaugh to protect him, because Mr. Kavanaugh worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through him he met his wife, Ashley, who was the author of the Bush report.
What will happen after the FBI has made its report?
The voting will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear that Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in the Senate; if so, President Mike Pence could break the equality and present it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of refugees has "decreased" since Kim is in power
The number of people fleeing from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean Unity Department, said there were 1,127 refugees in the previous year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the imposition of greater restraints on passenger traffickers had a major impact.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Almost all North Korean refugees are offered South Korean citizenship sooner or later.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled across China; it has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas (DMZ) which has tough protective measures.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and is often forced to do so.
North Korea and South Korea are still at war on their own, and relations between them have significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries gathered in Pyongyang to talk about the denuclearization negotiations that had been stalled.
Earlier, in June, a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un took place in Singapore, where the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons was agreed.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the U.S. of not making any progress on the matter.
"If we don't have any trust in the United States, we won't have any trust in our national security, and so we don't have weapons left first," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says she's "hysterical" to Brett Kavanaugh, and she's not ready to be in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the parliament's minority, said she was "hysterical" to the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and that she was not ready for the Supreme Court in terms of genius.
Pelosi's comments were made in an interview on Saturday at the Austin, Texas Tribune Festival.
"I could not have prevented myself from thinking that if a woman had ever acted like this, they would have said it was 'hysterical'," said Pelosi, which was the reaction Kavanaugh had had to face the Senate Judicial Committee's testimony on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were teenagers.
In the initial conversation, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and sometimes he almost started screaming and totelka when talking about his family and youth.
He also explicitly denounced the committee's Democrats, and allegations against him said Hillary Clinton was "organized and offensive" by liberals who were angry at the loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony makes it clear that he cannot be in the Supreme Court because he has shown an impartial opinion against the Democrats.
"With these votes and his attitude against Clinton and the Democrats, he has remained out of the league," he said.
Pelosi objected to Kavanaugh when asked whether he would oppose it if the Democrats elected him and obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this: if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not ready to be in the Supreme Court, not to be in the court that is at the moment," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge of the District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, Kavanaugh is concerned about trials against the Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he applies the conservative justice.
In the Court of Appeal, Kavanaugh avoided the questions when asked whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"A hysterical and impartial person can't go to court and hope that we'll get well," Pelosi said.
And the women have to command.
It is a fair speech, a terrible anger of months and years, and it cannot be released without crying.
"When we get angry, we cry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do I?"
She continued: "A woman who was an executive at some point helped me tremendously, and she told me that she was crying when she was angry, but that she developed a technique: when she was angry, and when she started crying, she could say this to me: "She was talking to me like this.
But I'm angry."
And then, he went on.
I thought it was a great idea.”
Malkos are not misinterpreted to express anger, because to some extent they are misinterpreted.
I remember clearly something that happened to me in one of my first jobs. Most of them were men in an office. There, I was crying in anger once, and a more mature woman came to me from the neck. I was a little scared from the beginning. I hit the boss coldly. I asked for it.
"Don't ever let them see you crying," he said.
"I don't know if you're upset.
They think you’re sad, and they’ll feel good because they understand you.”
Patricia Schroeder was a Democratic ally in Colorado at the time, and worked with Gary Hart in the race for her presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a vessel called Monkey Business and his wife was not in love with another woman, and when Mrs. Schroeder refused the race, he decided to be the same presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," he said laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Somebody called him "The Red and the Seven Pigs."
As the campaign began a long time ago, he was collecting money behind it, so he decided he would not enter the race until he raised <0x24>2 million.
The fight was lost.
He knew the men were given <0x24>1,000 by some followers who gave him only <0x24>250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he asked himself.
When he gave a speech and announced that he was not going to make an official campaign, he was very impressed: he was very grateful to the people he protected, the frustration with the system of collecting voters instead of voters, and the anger with sexist attitudes.
"You would have thought I was very nervous," explained Ms. Schroeder, as the press saw her reaction.
"You would have thought that Cleenex was my protector.
I remember thinking this: What will they write in my book?
"Did you cry?"
Trade wars between the United States and China could bring benefits to Beijing
The rescues that marked the beginning of the trade war between the U.S. and China were devastating, and even though there is a live conflict, the successes between the countries may bring Beijing benefits in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, when he imposed a tax on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week's most significant milestone is that new tariffs will be applied to products worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150,000 billion) due to the fact that more than half of the goods will be shipped from China to the U.S.
Beijing has repeatedly imposed repressive measures, with the latest tariffs rising between five and ten percent to U.S. sales worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has said it will equate every U.S. hike, and the world’s second-strongest economy will not easily change its point of view.
Asking Washington to go back would lead to a trial, but it would be more embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping to publicly bow down to the U.S..
However, experts say that if Beijing does the right thing, the pressures on the U.S. trade war could benefit China in the long run, since the dependence between the two economies would be reduced.
"A quick decision by Washington or Beijing politicians would create conditions for economic turmoil in one of the two countries, which is more risky than observers initially thought," said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the U.S. Security Intelligence Centre.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready to return refugees who want to return voluntarily, and is seeking help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by the long war for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today’s situation is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the anti-terrorism process,” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normalise their return as soon as possible.
Now it is a good situation for refugees who want to voluntarily return to the country because of the economic measures that made it difficult for them to live and maintain their daily lives and had to leave.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be very grateful for its help in rebuilding the country that has been destroyed.
But he stressed that he would not accept any conditional support or support from the countries that supported the conflicts.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
After winning the U.S. team with 16.5 points in the final, the European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup at the Le Golf National outside of Paris (France).
The U.S. has lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The crown was brought back by Europe when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson suffered a bad pass almost throughout the championship, and threw the knock-out hit into the water in the 16th hole of Part 3; thus, he passed to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Milinari was featured in all rounds, and since the start of the current format of the tournament in 1979, he has become one of four players who have ever scored 5, 0 and 0.
Jordan Spieth scored 5 and 4 and stayed out against the European team's worst player: Thorbjorn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the world's best player, scored 2 and 1 against the United Kingdom's Ian Poulter, and reached the final of the Ryder Cup.
Sergio García, who took part in eight Ryder Cup cups, became the main European winner of the championship, with 25.5 race points.
“I don’t normally cry, but I can’t avoid it today.
It's been a tough year.
So, he thanked Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I’m very happy to be able to get the cup back.
This is teamwork, and I'm happy to have been able to help," García said, impressed by the victory of Europe.
John Ram has passed the testimonial to Tiger Woods, who defeated American myth (2 and 1) in Sunday's singles game.
"I'm very proud to have won Tiger Woods; I grew up seeing that man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost four games in France, and now has a record of 13, 21, and 3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics, for one of the best players ever to have won 14 major titles, only above Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the entire weekend looking for a solution to the bad situation, except for the players Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played good quality golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Fury said of the team's bad game: "I'm excited about my boys; they've tried.
This morning, we put pressure on Europe for a moment.
It didn't work out well.
Look at Thomas's.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played very well.
We will meet again, I will work with the U.S. PGA and the Ryder Cup Cup Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love my 12 boys, and I am very proud to be their captain.
We have to accept defeat.
We stayed outside.”
