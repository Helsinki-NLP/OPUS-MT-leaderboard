9-year-old boy found in Tampere
Police have been on a search mission for a 9-year-old boy who fled Tampere on Tuesday night.
An announcement of the disappearance of the boy who moved from West Tampere with his friend has been circulated on social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and he is not at risk for life or health.
The boy's father told Ecta-Sanom about midnight knowing that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're starting the post-processing.
The boy was found in the neighborhood, Dad told me.
Ronaldo is back on track - Messi's second goal
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League over the weekend and continued his career in the Champions League.
The fight between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the Champions League was at least for the last moment.
Real Madrid’s Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all-time goalkeeper’s record when he shot Shahtar Donetsk’s visitor in two penalties and one game situation.
Ronaldo has raised his goal to 80, with Barcelona’s Messi, which was ahead of Tuesday’s match, scored 77 goals.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has been competing in the Italian Serie A soccer league since the start, but in the Champions League D, it began strong with a 2-1 visitor victory over Manchester City.
The most wins were made ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack bored the absence of Sergei Aguero.
Injured in the weekend's volleyball game, Aguero came on the field only in the last ten minutes.
Manchester United's second team also suffered a tough match against PSV Endhoven in the Netherlands after a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old team-mate Luke Shaw's visit lasted only an hour.
PSV's dangerous-looking slippery slope hit the attacking ManU pack so badly that Shaw's leg was likely to break.
Shaw slept on the grass of the Eindhoven home stadium for ten minutes before the medical staff left to take him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU’s joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno leveled before the break with an additional time.
The PSV win was won by Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
In the Champions League season, Paris Saint-Germain started in the A-Box.
Argentinian Angel Di Maria has changed his Manchester United shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through the right and raised Johan Wiland, the Malmö painter, over the back of the ball.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
The PSG has been selected as one of the season’s successes.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which belongs to the league’s small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic met for the first time with his professional team from Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team, the Moscow TsSKA, lost to the B-Block match against Wolfsburg in Germany 0-1.
Opposition Party Calls for Immediate Divorce – President Speaks Wrong
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe delivered the same speech he had held a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has once again delivered the same speech in Parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently realized that the speech was not the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe, 91, is in full control.
The main opposition party of the MDC called on Mugabe to step down from his position because it is too old to rule.
Mugabe's aides rushed to say that the confusion had only occurred in Mugabe's suburb and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe’s speech discussed earlier and now China’s influence on the country’s economy.
Germany and Austria Want Extraordinary Summit on Refugee Crisis
Germany and Austria have announced an additional EU leaders' summit next week due to the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, who chairs the summits, assessed the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, leaders should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to become more efficiently registered in Europe.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum-seekers belong to the table of the interior ministers.
Teacher Admits He Shot His Girlfriend During Emergency Call
The voice is only a little colored university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb pointed out that his "golden dog" is alive and probably shocked, as well as said that the contact details of the deceased woman's close relatives can be found on this phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss’s body and anger page with a handwritten message: “I’m so sorry I hope I could cancel this beloved Amya and she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me,” the letter said.
Nothing suggested that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Cleveland State University in Minnesota, had already travelled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus where police believe he was shot and killed by a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this study.
Lynn Buford, head of police at Delta State University, told university officials she heard about the shooting at 10:18.
She said Lamb had called a fateful emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths increased by one more: Lamb committed suicide as the police circled the end.
Authorities were still trying to find out Lamb's motives the day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors due to the school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, but with potential problems.
Students said they were waiting for their classes.
The police at Prentiss's place of death, Gautier, said Lamb had no violent past or criminal records.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book in which he thanked "mighty people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lambi, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, told Lamb that he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked for hospital leave from Delta State University, saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the University’s remuneration principles meant that while Lamb had worked hard for his PhD degree, it did not give him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
William LaForge, the university’s director, said there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt to his knowledge, but that “there was clearly something in Lamb’s mind.”
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb had fled the campus, the police caught up with him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile and a half south of his parents’ home in the suburb of Mississippi, Washington County investigator Methel Johnson said.
Lamb's car was still running in a hurry.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people living there.
Lamb was born in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3,500 students and is located in a city with approximately 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his PhD in Educational Sciences in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb 20 when they met through common friends.
Hairston's friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried for many years to teach Hairston to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer at the time.
“All the girls were melting wax while he was there,” said 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the suburb of Jackson, Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss apparently had been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning who lived with them in the riverside brick house in Gautier.
Police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, told them they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really shocked," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he had not met Lambia, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together on the rivers.
O'Steen told me that his daughter does and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several online companies.
The Julep Rome barkeeper and occasional entertainment organizer Mike Shaffer, located near Gautier, says he saw Lamb and Prentiss last night on September 5, when Lamb had stopped his guitar and lipstick performance for a rare audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were playing and throwing bullets at each other.
So they were both fairly nuts.
The deceased teacher, Schmidt, led a first-year student seminar program and had specialised in Indian and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the school.
Schmidt was married and had three young children.
He studied at Kansas Emporia State University and was the chairman of his brotherhood and student administration.
On Tuesday night, the Delta State campus in Cleveland hosted a candlestick show involving some 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the exhibition, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching will continue on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time to recover.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report on Mississippi's Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus from Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans took part in the report.
The case has been corrected by the fact that the police now say Lamb called the emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it doesn’t hire as many employees for the holiday as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says that current regulars and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, while in the 2014 holiday season there were 45,000 employees.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although the holiday season is months away, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to assist in the occupancy of stores, as well as in the sale, shipment and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "dating" with Princess Diana
Back to the Future was a professionally important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that my seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana’s place was next to me,” he said in the upcoming documentary Back in Timen.
The film starts and I think that I’m just a little out of line and out of hand from dating the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Foxia, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Returning to the Future was his first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: "For me, it's undoubtedly the best time travel movie of all time."
Back in Time is available as a subscription video, as a DVD and in some movie theaters in October.
U.N. leader says Syria will not be solved armedly
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict "is not resolved armedly", and the additional weapons only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader once again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr Ban said in a press conference on Wednesday that he intends to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in the context of the Ministerial Week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
Mr Ban called on the five permanent Member States to demonstrate the solidarity and unanimity they showed in dealing with the Syrian crisis in the context of the Iran nuclear programme.
8 Support Results That Show Donald Trump Is Serious
Some have tried to cut him into a windmill.
Others just think he's a joke.
Some are waiting for the collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump out of the top of the support polls, it has not (still) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national polls in ten, Donald Trump has been led by a two-digit chapter, and some have started to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king’s nomination possibilities.
The election period is only in its early stages.
These results do not mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
Commentators note that at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his leadership position to Herman Cain, who had never regained any state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in the general election.
However, outsiders such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organization Club for Growth have noted Trump’s ingenuity and have begun to use his funds to bankrupt him.
The following recent earnings survey results suggest that the real estate king is not just a transitional stage:
Trump’s popularity figures have made a complete reversal.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University’s support polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans were positive about the real estate kingdom.
By mid-July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52%.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first democracies.
In a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60% of Republicans said they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “interested” or “satisfied” if Trump was a candidate.
Only two out of ten said that they would be "consterned" if he were to become a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates almost the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% "intrigued" vs. 40% of Trump).
What’s next for the most exciting?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters would be "displeased" or "satisfied" if a favored by the ruling party's Jeb Bush would be a candidate.
Trump’s flamboyant nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his powerful speeches and insults, according to Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52% of Republican-backed voters at national level think that the real estate kingdom has a proper character for the president.
According to a Quinnipiac poll last week in Iowa, the number is the same: 52% of Republicans think Trump has the right quality for the leader.
However, according to the ABC/Post poll, 44% of respondents believe that her character is not suitable for president, and nearly six out of ten believe that her character does not belong to the White House.
Republicans are accustomed to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who is most likely to be nominated as Republican candidates.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Information disclosure: Republican voters have not always had the brightest crystal ball available.
In the last election, four out of ten Republicans believed that Rick Perry would be nominated, and only 28% voted for the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters consider the Trump campaign credible.
Even if Republicans were to stand up for another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the narrow field is likely to have promoted Trump’s leadership, as Trump’s opposition support has spread among many other candidates.
However, a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral competition between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump gets majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina 13 points, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points each.
He's on a counterpoint with Ted Cruz.
The only Trump candidate to win?
If they were put in opposite positions, Ben Carson would win businessman Trump with a big 18-point difference.
It is the majority of Donald Trump’s supporters who have made the decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only a little over half of Trump’s voters have decided which voters will go to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say for sure that he will never change his mind.
46% said that they could potentially change their candidates.
In any case, Trump’s biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump’s side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "supporters" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been in the middle of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s power focus will push Latino voters further away from the Republican Party and harm rebranding enterprises.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the center of things, so is Donald Trump.
The disappointment in the government has risen to a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson’s support now covers about half of Republican voters, largely because of their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in an ABC/Post poll on Monday that they would rather choose a non-political person than someone with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey of Iowa found that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "unhappy" and 21 percent "really angry".
Jeremy Corbyn’s First Interview with the Prime Minister
Corbyn's first interview hour has been eagerly awaited since his choice.
The new Labour Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will meet David Cameron for the first time in the Prime Minister’s questioning hour.
Corbyn rises to ask his first six questions after a little bit of a half-day, and probably both the media and Labour representatives closely monitored his performance.
Corbyn has called for this weekly show "less theater and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual trade unions' central meeting on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour Party leader’s decision to stand silently during the national song at the memorial service on Tuesday, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has sparked criticism among Conservative Party representatives and appeared on several front pages.
Corbyn's decision to sing national anthem has caught the attention
Corbyn's spokesman said he was "respectfully silent in the season" and that he acknowledged "the courage of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
Corbyn's shadow government member, Owen Smith, told BBC Twon Newsnight that he had called on the Labour leader to sing a national song despite his view that the royal house should be shut down.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to participate in Corbyn's inner circle, drawing on disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs, with less than one-sixth of the parliamentary parties initially supporting him as leader.
BBC policy-maker Robin Brant said linear differences in the party's position in the European Union and the government's contribution ceiling have also "recovered" within the Labour Party after Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at a trade unions central organization meeting that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Shadow government secretary of labour and pensions Smith said the party was "very clear" that they were only opposed to the government's plans to lower the ceiling from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Corbyn became the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has met in the last decade, when he was the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Party leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says he has "forced" ideas into questions to the Prime Minister, and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn, a representative of the Islington North region, has said that the Prime Minister's questioning hours are too opposing and that he intends to refrain from both scrupulous speech and deception, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's finance secretary Angela Eagle will act in his place during questioning hours when Corbyn is not involved - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues may also be allowed to speak at times, and he has said that he has approached the President of the Chamber, John Bercowia, from the sidelines of the matter.
When Cameron rose to leadership in 2005, he said he wanted to move further from a political theater that is often combined with the Prime Minister’s questioning sessions, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since they were first televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's questioning hour has been an important gauge in assessing the director's discretion, his management of the lower house, and his position with other representatives, although critics have been criticized for the threats of questioning hours.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless Young People Are Trained to Become Photographers
The center of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn livelihood.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make a profit.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

Punjab’s value rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The value of the stake jumped up after the numbers showed a rise in UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK salaries, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared to the same time last year.
The rate of growth was the fastest since 2009 and was considered to bring estimates of price increases.
The point rose by more than 1% against <0x24>1,5505, and by 0.84% against <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at an increase of 1.49 percent to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share in the market and increased by 20% after competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would combine two of the world’s largest panamas and other brands including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peron and Grolsch.
Burberry’s shares rose 0.9 percent after a competitive luxury product group from Richmont received encouraging news.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had begun to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised <0x24>2.5 billion by rolling out shares as part of its debt cut strategy.
The Mond’s stocks were the biggest drops in the index by 4.3 percent since Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from the company to the “sale” form.
JD Sports rose 3.1 percent after the sportswear company released the information for six months before taxes: an 83 percent increase to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Damage Expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says that if the minimum wage is raised in the UK, it could mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers is increasing."
However, this purchasing power is not likely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs could be allocated to the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against Aldi intrusion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi’s attack in South and West Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA merchants in South and West Australia before Aldi’s <0x24>700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and its first store early next year in South and West Australia, where up to 120 stores are coming. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with show-markets and local grocery stores, collecting grocery stores and building IGAb media streams.
IGA merchants and buyers have jumped in, and brands such as the ice cream maker from Dunsborough, Simmo's, offer tasty IGA stores, and store owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football players.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29, when this food, alcohol and iron wholesaler will organize an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot in play, as South and West Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA trade area, with profit margins higher than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
Visitors to shopping in South and West Australia are known to be cornered, and IGA resellers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture about 5% of the food market in the two states within 12 months of the opening of the first trades. The turnover is received from all operators, but mainly from independent retailers.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA resellers could lose <0x24>360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose <0x24>250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 stores in the west next year, generating <0x24>500 million and <0x24>600 million in sales in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and volumes at the base of Metcash’s high fixed costs could cost Metcash about <0x24>13 million in business losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash will lose market share in the eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were the most faithful of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food and food sales will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016; 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, so that its market share will drop from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent in 2020.
Last week, the managing director of the leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very potentially lose in a decade".
Metcash has refused to publicly respond to Douglass' comments.
However, it is understood that a member of the Metcash Board would have contacted Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food business, which delivers products to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43% since 2012. This indicates a decrease in the amount of assets and a reduction in the debt financing of operations.
However, the wholesaler holds its side, and has invested more than <0x24>150 million annually by lowering the prices of hundreds of products weekly to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers to restore their stores by adding a faster selection of single-breasted and fresher brands.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says that price drops and sell-offs have increased attractiveness, and he hopes that wholesalers will return to profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy Supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism for her behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered from a lateral storm that has ravaged her friend Nick Kyrgioksen, who deserves more honor than criticism for her own behavior, said Steve Healy, chairman of the Australian Tennis Association.
A talented twin named "Special Ks" Kokkinakis was unwillingly made public about the case in which Kyrgios angered Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, in a shooting in Cincinnati, the Chief Justice twice had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared, "Wawrinkan should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that cock."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his mileage after the cramp smashed his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been Kokkinakis's relentless defender.
The young man is currently in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth from second place in doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
"I think quite strongly that Thanasi has only been drawn to the worst," Healy said.
He broke his lap in losing a cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his lap in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently well, even in rather provocative situations with US Open Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves compliments.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a bit harshly.
She is very mature at the age of 19, she works hard, fits in with the team and so on, and she has never had any problems with other players. She is appreciated in the dressing room, she trains strongly, is in good condition and is quite calm and mature according to her husband's needs and young men.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take Kyrgyzstan to major games starting Friday describing this "common decision" as a solution for everyone, but still supports the return of the Canberra team to the standard equipment.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgiosis]," Healy said.
And Nick has grown up really fast, as Federer and Murray have noted, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets. However, we try to support him with courage and courage, and we try to help him with the time, and if he understands the act
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, detains migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border against Serbia by detaining those who attempted to enter the country illegally, with the aim of blocking the flow of migrants arriving there.
The border was followed by chaos when hundreds of migrants gathered in an impartial area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with outrage.
The people who have fled the violence of their own countries have now set up their tents and set up for an indefinite period of time on the road between the two countries’ checkpoints.
The frustration, however, increased.
While the police helicopter was standing above them, the immigrants shouted, "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian police.
Some of them refused food and water to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister said it was "impossible to accept" the return of migrants from Hungary as they arrive more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
The debate is to be held in the coming days with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
A controversy at the Hungarian-Serbian border arose after the 28 nationalities failed to draft a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed on the division of responsibility for 40 000 asylum seekers, who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and hopefully talked about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take up an additional 120,000 refugees, including
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria have called for an additional EU summit next week to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will work in the near future.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and enabled you to be shut down and asylum cases to be accelerated.
At the same time, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that aid at the Serbian border is ready, the country will also be able to set up a part of the peak yard against its Romanian border to stop the flooding of migrants across the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish a spike thread between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and destination for refugees in the European Union, many of whom are fleeing wars from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees in search of a better life, and not those who are eligible for protection during the war - this view strongly contradicts other EU countries, including Germany.
The new legislation, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, now defines a crime to override or damage the 4-metre (13-foot) tie-wire fence that the government has built on the southern border with Serbia, and includes longer prison sentences for convicted people.
"Due to the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the expected military deployment next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Orban’s home security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said the authorities had arrested 45 people while trying to cross the border, as well as 15 who had already reached the country.
They were able to overcome damage to the aid, are now incarcerated by the police, and are charged with violations defined in the new laws.
The authorities are fixing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also shut down two out of seven crossing points at the Serbian border on Tuesday morning after sending a train covered in a whirlwind to close one of these points.
The pilgrimage site near the Hungarian Roszke was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office metal container for human treatment and crowds came in.
About 20 came in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorways between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse to eat and drink until they were allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 Elections: According to the National Survey, Hillary Clinton’s leadership to Bernie Sanders has been dumped
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead a two-digit Democratic nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders arrested her.
Clinton now supports 47% of Democrats’ voters (58% down), and Sanders in second place supports 27% (17% up).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will step down as president, but he is in favour of 15% of the Democrats’ vote.
More than five months before the start of the elections, most of the Democrats say it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
Clinton’s supporters, however, stand behind their choices more closely than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity has declined among a number of populations since last month’s CBS News poll, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has been refined.
His popularity with men has declined considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton’s front-running campaign for Democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and he’s now at levels with Sanders.
However, Clinton is clearly leading with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders with a double-numbered number of liberals, but now Sanders leads the group by five percentage points.
Approximately half of the country’s Democratic voters say they will enthusiastically support Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
A quarter said they supported him with some reservations, and 15 percent would support him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It’s not very surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely eager to support him.
Opinions are more confusing for those who currently do not support Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support him.
Where 48% of Democrats say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, Republican first man Donald Trump says the same less Republican voters (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted her to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that she had an appropriate experience (16%). After that, the most popular answers were that now is the right time for the female president (13%) and that she is the best percentage.
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Because the vice president is influencing a possible presidential nomination, 57 percent of Democrats would like to see him already in the competition - even if a third disagree.
When asked by the Democratic voters who they would choose for the nomination of the second party, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say they would choose Biden, who is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek a Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's leadership from Sanders will grow. If Biden leaves, the leadership will be 20 percentage points, but if he omits, the number will be 30.
55% of Democratic voters say Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
At this level, Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who consider him the most voting has increased.
However, when the Democrats were asked what was the most important thing about the candidate, they raised their views ahead of voting.
Even last month, no Democrat candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are very good at certain key issues among the voters of their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, reliable, and strong leaders.
Biden manages the triangle best in honesty, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty-three percent of Democrats say they don’t think Clinton is fair and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don’t have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
Considering all these facts, about a quarter of the voters say they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
While Hillary Clinton’s use of her personal email address and server while she’s a foreign minister still raises questions, most of the Democrats are pleased with her explanation of the matter and say that it didn’t affect their general opinion of her.
However, this is different when we look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
People’s opinions were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say the e-mail policy did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36% say that their opinions about him have deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their views on Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him to be honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider him to be honest and trustworthy, and this figure has dropped by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percent since last month.
62% of registered voters say they don’t consider Clinton to be fair and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of the country’s registered voters do not consider Trump to be fair and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered to be honest, but many do not have an opinion about him, just like Carson does not.
The margin of error in the survey, which was attended by 351 Democratic voters, is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson joins Donald Trump in CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates gathered half of all the votes in the new poll, leaving others to fight for their feet.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen from 23% of the previous CBS poll published on Tuesday before the Fox News poll last month.
At the same time, Carson rose from 6 percent to 23 percent.
The questionnaire also found that Carson is very good with different demographic groups and is outspoken among Trump’s highly educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field has been left behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. The support for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has fallen the most: from 10 percent last month to the current 2 percent.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll in September is <0x2B>/- 6%.
Last week’s latest CNN/ORC poll showed Carson is on the rise in polls: he has 19 percent support for Republicans, and Trump is 32 percent ahead of him.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson’s popularity rose last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgery in vain, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on his campaign visit to Iowa last Saturday.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of First-Year Student at Baruch College
Almost two years after a student died at a brotherhood simulation ceremony in the Pocono Mountains area of Pennsylvania, murder charges have been filed against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a membership rally in September 2013, and then delayed his hospitalization, thereby contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say Deng's eyes were closed and his back was loaded with a bag of over 13 kilograms full of sand, after which he was repeatedly stabbed to the ground as he tried to walk through the ice to paint.
Eventually Deng complained that his head was hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
The members of the fraternity did not call the emergency number after Dengi was turned on, but according to the allegations, they waited for an hour before they brought him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, search online for information on his symptoms, and contact the Brotherhood’s national president, Andy Meng, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said in a press conference.
“This is where the members started hiding their ritual gear, so they practically put the brotherhood’s well-being in front of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
Dengi wasn't allowed to run, and he died the next morning.
According to the body arrest protocol, Deng suffered repeated cramps of a dull object on the head, body, and tendons.
"Too many families have suffered from fraternity infections, when each year at least one student has died as a result ever since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this is an important step taken by the authorities.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County has advocated that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
32 other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent piracy and criminal conspiracy.
“We don’t want to be held accountable only by individuals; if there is an organization behind the incident that has accepted the situation either formally or informally, they should also be held accountable,” Wagner said in a press conference.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity from disconnecting with the local department.
This is what happens when the U.S. central bank raises interest rates.
An interest rate rise is coming, and the market for rising exchange rates is falling, bond yields are rising and the economy is going to have to decline.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long this will take or how long it will take.
The past does not provide much help in terms of timing, specifically in terms of the economy.
The influx of depression has lasted for only 11 months after the first lift, sometimes for as long as 86 months.
The U.S. central bank’s aggressive interest-raising has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how economic and financial assets react.
That is why US central bank officials have so strongly insisted that investors should focus not on raising interest rates, but mainly on the development slope of the time to normalise the situation.
In fact, there are a number of variables in the equation.
Eventually, however, the market participants may find that all the interest rate lending has been over-injected.
“The central bank’s first post-Global Economic Crisis increase is inevitably interpreted in some circles to the end of the ‘small money’ era,” Capital Economics’s chief global affairs expert Julian Jessop said in a statement.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of the U.S. interest rates to normal, albeit still low, to the level of such a shifting shock that many feel fearful.
However, this does not mean that it will have no effects.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react on the basis of previous developments:
As has been seen in the market over the last month, anticipating an interest rate raise can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite as dramatic.
“It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for 12-24 months after the first increase, which in turn may reflect a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the central bank’s increase.
More specifically, in the last 35 years, the market has generally been strong, with an increase of around 14% when approaching the increase, 250 days after that, the situation is quite steady (average increase of 2.6%), and the normal state has been reached in the case of 500 days, at the rate of 14%, at the rate of 14%, at the rate of the average yield at the rate of 6 months.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is usually more pronounced at the later stage of the growth cycle when returns begin to fall.
Recessions are part of economic life, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not been faced before and that can accelerate the decline.
This is particularly the gross domestic product, which will be closest to the lowest ever before the central bank’s interest rate rise.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 increases since 1950, nominal annual GDP was only twice below 4.5%.
While the figure was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will remain after the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, according to the Atlantic Federal Reserve.
Interest raises in such a fragile economy can be risky and raise the question of whether this time is different, Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been prepared for a year-round increase by the central bank, and everyone is awaiting this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase at this meeting, futures trading predicts only a 25% probability.
“Our research shows that since 1950, all cycles of increase have so far experienced an increasing flexibility in supercycles where GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peak very quickly after recovery has begun,” the report says.
On the other hand, there has now been an exceptionally slow recovery from the decline, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has awaited overwhelmingly the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now it is already in its 74th month.
Fixed returns have also been volatile as the market expects interest rates to rise, and the model is somewhat reminiscent of the findings made on capital.
The main difference is that when a central bank changes its line, its effects are seen faster in debt securities than in shares.
The direction of the return on debt securities appears to change immediately at the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the recovery cycle, the yield of debt securities will fall immediately,” Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies believe that rising interest rates will lead to the convergence of long-term and short-term bond yields, thereby leveling the yield gap.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about finding a return," said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst with Schwab.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank’s line proposals.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are a number of signs that markets have adapted to tighter monetary policy outlooks,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the return curve is more flat, the credit margins have increased and the volatility has increased - all of these are typical of the market when the central bank has tightened its lineage.
In general, companies with a predominantly U.S.-based business will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multi-national companies with a lot of debt are getting worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have finances.
“History shows that ‘quality’ shares are generally the most profitable in the three months following the first interest rate,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in their customer-oriented report.
Companies with strong turnover exceeded low turnover by an average of five percentage points after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility shares performed better than low-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage units) and 3 (percentage units).
The debt is going to be a big problem.
Those companies that have a lot of variable interest rates in debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of the stock market, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the rise in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also benefit from higher returns, even though experts disagree on how fast the effect feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "popularization"
He argues that separating it from a commercial competitor becomes increasingly difficult.
In addition, he received the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just travelling to the Brit Awards.
Colleague Damien Collins criticized The Voice, saying it is not original
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" to Classic FM, claims a senior MP by adding pressure to the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio channel seemed to “recognize” its content, and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
“It seems that Radio 3 – I don’t want to use the term ‘popular awareness’ – is becoming Classic FM,” he said.
He also took the lead in the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
“Launched last year, the BBC Music Awards are just different from the British Awards industry.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that I can remember when you actually just copied something that’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC's CEO denied the allegations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitor in terms of live music and information sharing to the public.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can’t learn from anywhere else.
In fact, its commitment to live music and music is of first class.
"In addition, I think it's really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief Alan Davey claimed that the channel had to do more work than before to reach out to the public because the British knew less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC’s offer that was criticized for getting to the feet of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice, a music competition that the BBC bought from Dutch production company Talpa Media for <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed because it is not original and it is in no way unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 program, which serves as the star judges Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced "in the very style of the BBC".
He added that he wants the production company "to discover success from within its own house" the next time it starts the entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of the upcoming The Voice seasons, or to order that the money of licenseees be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales rose at the lowest so far in August, Black Friday may be the cause
Online sales rose 7% in the first three months of 2015
Last month there was an increase of the lowest since the start of the statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday may reduce consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for over a decade and has transformed many of Britain’s shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are now signs of a leveling of online sales in the air, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August increased at least since the beginning of statistics in 2000: only 5% increase from last year.
Experts say there are signs of a leveling of online sales in the air, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
“If we look at the growth rates of previous years and go back to the year 2000, it was clear that the situation would make sense over time,” Andy Mulcahy, JMRG sales index reporter, told The Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales were confirmed when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as a sofa.
But now it's leveling, and (growth) can count.
The phenomenon of Black Friday imported from the United States has been considered one of the reasons behind the slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers will stop making purchases before the last Friday of November.
Last year, more than five times the average buyer went to their computers to hijack stores by hacking many shoppers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which allowed buyers to argue about discoveries, can stop shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five pounds were used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using shopping street fashion chains.
Muslims Bury Deaths in Mecca Elevation Crash, Sanctions on Bin Laden Family
Muslims carry 29 dead bodies across the streets during first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the collapse of a building jet to the Saudi Binlad Group
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were injured as the lifting wheel collapsed.
29 The dead were carried in the air across the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them; the victims died as the lifting arm collapsed in the Great Mosque of Mecca.
Mainly white-dressed surfers filled the route to honor the first dead who made their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A sprawling passage passed the holy place, where just a few days ago the elevator fell through the roof of the mosque and plunged worshipers.
The bodies were released to be buried when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed the building group of the Bin Laden family to be responsible for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
29 bodies of worshippers killed in the Great Mosque of Mecca were transported across the streets
Among the deceased was the father of four children, Qasim Akram from the Manchester area, who was on his first holy walk when the lifting wheel collapsed.
Akram had been to the grand mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn in that the jihad in Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that the Binlad Group should not have been left up for the elevator when it was not in use.
The government-led Saudi Press Agency’s Arabic-language version of the decision said the Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The agency’s English-language service did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s executives were prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the lifting cures to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the Hajj holy ceremony to be held later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published reports of the collapse of the poor and its representatives have not been arrested for comments.
The Royal Decree also blamed the fact that it did not use up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of lifts around Mekka’s grand mosque, which are part of the huge construction work led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades, and it is leading major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda’s deceased leader, Osama bin Laden, was a rebel son who was banned by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse took place in windy and rainy weather only days before millions of people arrive in the kingdom for the sanctification, which every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to be paid to the families of the deceased and the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says cheap Eastern European workers are behind the popularity
The British are using more and more assistant services, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is on the rise
As a result, Screwfix stores aimed at professionals will open 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, City Headliner for the Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their left-wing and painters and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do household chores
It seems that if you’re clumsy with the left or you’re trying to paint the walls, you’re a minority now.
The UK is increasingly hiring assistants to do tea-self work at home, the company’s CEO behind B&Q said.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, said that the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is behind the popularity and that they offer their services at a low price.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for employees and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shop purchase decisions are made by the most beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
She said that changes in the population must be taken into account: there are now more one woman's households with more household chores than before.
Laury said: “Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women who run the UK’s top FTSE100 index companies and has rebuilt her management team with as many male and female men.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group with 50% of women, including its CEO and Chief Financial Officer.
Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - the difference is an important thing here.
It hasn’t been hard to find good women in the management team.”
Kingfisher announced a decrease in both revenues and sales for six months after the group took on the costs of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The three-ace government decided to resort to compulsory legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other payroll organisations began to force the same path, and as a result, the country will stand on Friday because of the broad voice of workers.
Many people think that there is also reason.
I wonder if the strikes are worth it, when it goes badly.
There is even a resistance movement.
Over 50,000 people have already reported on the internet that they are not going to take part in the discussion but are going to work.
In the old days, such a consensus would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no net to protest, but openly declaring himself rich would have been a small man’s political suicide.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of people in the million-member trade unions does not take a long time, but on the grounds of thinking it gives.
The role of the trade union movement is no longer as clear on its own as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government’s bold solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to roll under their own weight for years, now the unions are finally getting to the point, i.e., defending the rights of the worker, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may be willing to imprison the role of the ay movement when membership in the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever the organization’s actions are, it’s hard to believe that Friday’s speech will somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped for a long time.
For example, industrial production has already declined for 31 consecutive months.
GDP continues to decline, and unemployment is rising.
These things are supposed to force everyone's mind.
Lappeenranta University’s hard savings curve: 8.5 million savings target, staff reduced by 130
Lappeenranta Technical University is launching a savings curve, which aims to cut costs by a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start negotiations on the whole staff with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, it means a reduction of about 130 employees.
In addition, the other action aims to save <0x24>2 million.
The YT negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which predicts the actual activity to be 8.5 million deficits.
This is also affected by the government’s budget cuts.
In this financial year, the university will make about 2.6 million results of the deficit.
Expenditure will increase slightly next year, but the funding from the ministry will decrease by 2 million and the other by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.2 million.
The university’s total budget is about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The synergy between massive cuts in education and research and the reduction in corporate funding at our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in a statement from the University.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with trustees will begin next week on Tuesday and will last for six weeks as prescribed by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways
Sir Brian Souter, the British owner of Onnibus, tells Yle that the company is also aimed at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining the Finnish railways.
Stagecoach is one of the largest railway companies in the UK, Souter says.
Rail transport is expected to be gradually opened to competition.
The first is the turn of the metropolitan area in 2017-2018.
After close transport, there is long-distance transport.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transportation welcomes Onnibus’ plans.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has expressed an interest in rail transport among other international companies, which also has bus and rail transport in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
The U.S. central bank has to decide interest rates.
The rest of the world is on the verge of meeting the U.S. central bank for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
In a survey by Reuters with 80 economists, just over half of those who still believed the central bank would raise interest rates last week now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and the interest rates are kept at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event, because since the central bank cut interest rates to zero, it has been seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought billions of dollars into balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less of the rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for an increase, but the signs indicate that they also believe that the odds are against an increase.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20.00 (CET).
Delta State University shooter leaves apology message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting his colleague the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was "sorry" about the first murder and hoped "that we could cancel it," authorities said on Tuesday.
Ms. Gautier's police said Delta State University's professor of geography and social sciences Lamb called the emergency number around 10 a.m.
On Monday, he told me that he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send constables to his home.
He said he "captured his wife last night" and also mentioned that the house has a "sweet dog" that "doesn't bother anyone", but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller the name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police arrived, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a message written by 45-year-old Lamb: "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amya and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing the message, Lamb drove almost 500 kilometres to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday as police circled him.
William LaForge, the university’s director, said there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt to his knowledge, but that “there was clearly something in Lamb’s mind.”
Authorities said Tuesday that despite Monday's claims that Lamb believed Prentiss was in a relationship with Schmidt, there was "no information or evidence" of any "trimester".
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as "a good man."
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "shocked."
O'Steen said Prentiss and his daughter were "the best friends of all time."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online at home, and according to Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“He always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
The police told Lamb that he had called his relatives sometime on Monday to tell them that “he’s not going to jail.”
When police reached Lamb's 1st highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there, and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about the science of education at Delta States in the spring of 2015, according to the university’s website.
The Stars Who Lost Their Charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009, his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
According to rumors, he also had problems with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Anything like that really needs a tax.
Manchester United’s Luke Shaw has been out for months due to double-breaking
Luke Shaw got his right leg double when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Although the defender has been in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
Vamman triggered Hector Moreno's unintended tackling 15 minutes after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into PSV.
He was treated in the field for 9 minutes and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture in his leg and he's now in the hospital."
She'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then she'll be cut off in Manchester.
He's coming to Manchester United at the age of 18, he's in trouble, and then he plays great, and now that's what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen tank.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but the double fracture takes at least half a year, and he doesn't play in the block phase.
I hope he will be able to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card and a penalty shot.
Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian journalist was wrong.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it turned into a penalty shootout and a red card.
It was really bad with a two-legged roof.
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you for all your messages, the words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw’s case and loses to PSV
The English defender has an additional incentive for the recovery of the European Championships in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out due to such an injury, everyone is very sad.
The goal of our players is never to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for the Mexican team against Van Gaal in the 2014 World Cup.
“Moreno takes this seriously because it’s not meant to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it’s a bad thing,” Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn’t see Luke’s clutch.
Moreno told SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how hard this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after being chased by Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know Lorax better than that?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it won’t take long for it to learn almost from the outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When a holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister for his favorite book, he chose Dr. Seuss's book The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message posted on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoyed reading this book for my children, because it always feels like there is a picture or message that we have never seen before."
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to describe the book’s play, is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which a rather short original text was added with new characters and details.
"In the city of Tarville, inside the walls, where all nature is lost and even the air is a merchandise, Ted's son hopes to win his dreams to the heart of the girl by fulfilling Audrey's desire to see the right tree," the text says, not describing the love story, which was written in 1991.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds as if it were taken from the Lorax film's sketchbook on the Internet Movie Database website, which starts as follows: "To dream in the city of Tarville, where everything must be dreamed up in a dream, can be made out of art, and even air.
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the book. In it, a young, nameless boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by a greedy, greedy, tree-shouldering, lovable, lovable, lovable, lovable, lovable.
Such a relatively invisible PR task is likely to be outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read the book 20 times in a row to a child.
The Prime Minister’s spokesman said the text appears to have come from Cameron’s constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron’s staff, but did not comment on it at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of staying away from the England team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don’t think a repeat of the last 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't exclude any guest earnings from bills.
The Alastair Cook side may be less experienced than the three-year-old team, but it has good turns and the team’s thinking is strong: they don’t have scars from 2012, just young positivity.
Moeen Ali evolves in his spins and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although he is an unknown author at this level.
Adam Lyth drops from England's cricket team, replaces Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth from the team is understandably difficult for me to analyze because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against the attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but bearish truth is that cricketers are criticized on the basis of their scores.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root’s choice before the announcement, because, as I’ve said before, players are the best choice factors.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth’s season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own destiny.
Hopefully if he gets more runs to Yorkshire, a second chance comes up.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't perform as well as he could, and that didn't surprise me. Lyth is primarily a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the hitter will leave a mark.
Lyth was selected seven times to the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton was given the opportunity to play both at home and with guests.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean first when Lyth was in the top position, but that wasted chance is now the past.
Alex Hales comes with me, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
As a cricketer, he has something we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge.
He must at least give others the same opportunity as before him, but this really depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen being knocked down by Cook would have an extra feeder on the field but could have been held at four speeds, and I'm not against that.
I don’t understand why a striker could not hit there, and this left-handed guy has already proved to be a pretty cricketer.
Moe may not have done his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he is a threesome for them and there is little difference.
My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in the first half of the season, before moving to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari joins the team as a burglar, and, the little I’ve been doing with him, he feels very impressive as a young man.
People can look at his unorthodox stats - beating an average of 31, with a ball of 35 - and think it's a gambling game, but there are not too many feeders available and voters chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have some tough additions to the coach side.
Appointment of Sri Lankan striker Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the games may prove to be a nervous blow.
He is one of the most comfortable friends in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the White Ball Games, bringing both energy and a ruthless relaxation.
I have always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether playing or training, and he has the same skill to use as Mahala.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can revive the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, is resting for one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and pickers do not make schedules.
And it must be remembered that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on light grounds.
UK’s exit from the EU (Brexit) beneficiaries can win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's seminal renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are facing ever-increasing problems day by day, even if not taking into account even the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or no?"
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Faragens.
A European diplomatic friend recently explained that, since the EU is so deep in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of Britain’s self-centered agenda, which is full of controversy-ridden concessions, and the most disturbing already.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the trade unions decided that they would not want them if they violated social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance delay the summits or bilateral meetings held in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without the local eyewitness, and then come to the house to say,
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside the UK's EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," is said of Berlin - suggests that the shortest-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where we will not stand between them.
German conservative and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to stop acting before it goes down the same way it happened to late Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
He is also a disappearing force.
Poland may soon be a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice for selfies, when their energy should rather be directed at preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they don't want it because of similar separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even consciously plan to make useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiations were arranged" and "the renegotiations were of no relevance to the United Kingdom."
The Europeans have had a deep experience of how greedy the Fleet Street press is and how EU-skeptical the sole powers of the press are, what they were not at the time of the 1975 Tony Benn-inspired referendum, when our membership began in 1973.
They can dimly remember Boris Johnson, the biggest Euro-opportunist who made himself a name by writing "EU direct bananas" while being a Brussels letter exchanger in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a number of tax-gathering drivers, foreign hackers, and people whose home is nominally elsewhere and who own most of our newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same about them, but realizing that if you’re in a cage with a little gorilla, bananas have to be given up for grabs, unless you want to be on the gorilla’s lunch list and dinner later.
In fact, Miliband was more blairian than Blair himself when it came to resisting Cameron's renegotiation, because Bair had agreed to the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which the French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005.
The press never forgave him for that, either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly stabbed me in the back of the Westminster House on Monday (I told him he didn’t have time to waste on me anymore), seems to be in danger of recapturing Neil Kinnock’s 1980s boycotted Murdoch strategy and now he was in office.
While it may take time, however, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but undoubtedly Andrew Marri, whom Corbyn left the BBC on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, beautifully said, evolving.
He said he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, the majority of the people of the UK’s Independence Party, outside of the Ukip wartime attraction and the Conservative Party’s fiercest nationalism, can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not a Benn fan" Benn said so on both radio and television this week, when his inner squad would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint the horrific John McDonnell as finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his father was on TV trying to be unfaithful to his Labour government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat on the government.
Hilary's designs were more attractive.
But the fight to stay with us "in any situation" - Benn's statement - was not what McDonnell said, and not ultimately what Corbyn told the chiefs and representatives at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the 24-hour television era, and especially in the social media cycles, which is a delicate force for silence and silence.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to keep the Labour Party’s support clear in a referendum campaign.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic prosecution of EU membership (and therefore in line with their Benn-spiritual regulation’s economy and their anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate about leftist thinkers who have a dogma of women’s differences.
As for his bipartisanity with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to surrender), foreign diplomats just have to try and explain it to their leaders.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (even if there are some distrustful voters) on concessions to Britain, when it can be completely futile?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed at the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts Criticize Public Health England’s E-Tobacco Assessment
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency’s claim that electric tobacco is 95 percent less harmful than traditional tobacco was initiated by meeting 12 people, some of whom had links to the tobacco industry.
Experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed to Lancet’s criticism of the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electric smoking.
The PHE published its “virtual pillar” report last month, describing it as “a comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical journal Lancet published last month a main article attacking the PHE’s mainstream decision on an “exceptionally ugly basis”.
Two other BMJ researchers have questioned whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: “The main principle of health in Canada is that practices must be established for proven effectiveness.”
They say that the public's claim that PHE expects "the current best estimate is about 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco" is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a 12-person meeting that developed a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the disadvantages associated with different nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized into the study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is said to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported the public health mandates of BAT in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting said they had received funding from an e-tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding he said had previously received from Philip Morris International.
The selection criteria of the panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes a number of well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also report that they have received funding from the field in the study.
Others who have been there are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
PHE’s tobacco manager also participated in the meeting.
The study produced by the group “admits in a broad sense” that there is a lack of “uncontested evidence of disadvantages in most of the products and most of the criteria,” writes McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes act as a route for smoking in children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, said the statements in BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, “Electric tobacco is significantly less harmful than burning.”
Half of the people who smoked their lives died from addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to investigate their long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence looks like and what it does not, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about the relative dangers of tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from tobacco-related illness and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion annually.
By explaining the current evidence - i.e., while electric tobacco is not risk-free, its disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC Should Give Up EastEnders, Former Channel 4 Director Says
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "update anything" from hits such as this soap series located on Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fees should only be used to make programs that other broadcasters in the UK do not.
He criticized the BBC for putting public-service programs, which are likely to have a smaller audience, into difficult broadcasting times, against competitors’ most viewed programs and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more with other organizations, Johnson said he came to Channel 4 for six years to build a relationship with the BBC, in vain.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC is producing and broadcasting programs that would clearly match unsubsidized competitors," Johnson told the Upper House Communications Committee as part of his research on the future of the BBC.
If the licensing fee is held - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this message or for the long term - it should at least limit its production to programs that others do not do and do.
The Voice is broadcasted at the most important broadcast time because it wants to collect as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s obviously stupid.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should be funded for programs that could be funded even without state aid.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders the other, without denying the inside of the house.
To be honest, other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand how that's about public service broadcasting.
I don’t think that would weaken the BBC at all.”
Channel 4's lead serialist from 2004-2010, Johnson, said the BBC is guilty of hunting spectators "because of the goals of the people working there, and because they believe it's the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on the BBC's most popular series, reminiscent of the comments of former Sky director Tony Ball, and used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC would sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that BBC’s smaller public service programs “go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfills its responsibilities and can then proudly say, in defending the <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion pledged revenues, that we don’t feel like we’re all going to do this.
They put them in a place where no one will ever see them.
With regard to the promise payment, Johnson said to the Committee: "I challenge you to look for a more regressive system of who gets the most out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year gets a lot of reward, but I don’t know if that’s true for people who have 150 pounds of money because they don’t spend a lot on the BBC.
Former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reassess Reith's role in "inviting, training and entertaining".
He said that only a small portion of BBC production is now classified as education — he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio — and that it should be modelled on Australian and Canadian radios and transformed the task into "promoting, educating and entertaining."
With regard to partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events like Proms concerts, which he said are only a few on television, and allied themselves with commercial companies so that they can all be viewed online.
"Audiogenetics" enables the management of brain cells by means of sound waves
The video shows how the sunflowers change direction as soon as the sound pulse reaches them.
Researchers have raised mosquitoes with genetically modified nervous systems so that they can be controlled by sound waves.
Long-haired beetles change direction as soon as they reach the sound pulse, which is too high for the human ear to hear.
The impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerves with ultrasonic-reactive membranes.
Related: Researchers Reading and Writing Brain Activity in Light
The researchers said that worms show the functionality of a new method, called sound genetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body by hand.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method can one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive operation that conducts electrical impulses to people’s brains to treat Parkinson’s disease.
The skulls do not normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles reinforced the ultrasound waves, which then pass into the carpets.
Reinforced ultrasound waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, the structures that are present in the cell membranes of some mammals.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open up and activate the cells attached to them, according to a report published in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasonic-guided thrombocytopenia, Chalasani genetically modified the rats so that part of their nerve cells are TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on customized carpets, the microbubbles amplified the sound waves and transmitted them to the carpets where they connected the customized business nerves.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to switch nerve cells on and off using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike the light that needs to be transmitted from the optical fiber to the desired point within the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unhindered, so they can be transmitted to the brain from above the skull.
“We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses may be possible to get the targeted human neurons temporarily respond to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment,” Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal means of torture - delivered to your home!
Advertising may embarrass Britain’s arms trade
Watch the video against Amnesty International.
Horrible killing machines!
Kissing sneakers!
Snake bombs!
And electronic coagulation pumps that cause painful pain but leave no traces!
The beautiful sound and the symbolic language of the cartoons leaves no doubt that this advertisement of the world’s largest exhibitions is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to emphasize the British government’s willingness to trade weapons to the oppressive governments at Defence and Security Equipment International’s ExCeL Centre in London.

As a result of the special campaign, many posters have also appeared on bus stops and subways, requiring more detailed information.
"Precise information, Will you travel on the DLR route from September 15-18?" is asked together using the London underground font and brand, as the DLR track becomes a picture of the tank.
This September, a bunch of gun dealers arrive on the DLR route... Customers are asked to help stop the stations.
These 300 posters are made by the artists who were present at Banksy's Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters across London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a six-pound pack of six-college keys that, according to the collective, "access to a third of the entire planet's bus stop ads".
Transport for London has not been interested in this unauthorized "public vandalism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to export political works to outside galleries.
Many artists have started working with activists in resistance fights when they have realized that they have to go abroad if they want their art to influence society.
Another anti-arms trade poster greets workers in the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed over 100,000 times in the last 24 hours via Facebook. It was created for free by the ad agency VCCP, and also a graphic designer and background designer worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Leverin found that the exhibitions weren't advertised at all - and also ExCeL's calendar was empty at the time - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the idea of a more realistic corporate ad, but "was more stopping to emphasize it with bright colors and animation."
“They’ve done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about the illegal torture device that sells at the fairs,” Amnesty’s Tom Davies said.
Now the UK government needs to take action and ensure that the means of torture are not illegally sold in our own homes.
Perhaps the most creative artwork related to exhibitions comes from the inside of ExCeL as exhibitors trade fantasticly decorated products.
He said in a press release that he received an order from the U.S. military "from the left-handed AT4CS RS".
This includes "a unique anti-pipe mark that targets excellent effects on the inside of the object behind the tank".
No matter what it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student's apartment
It's been 11 years since I moved to my student apartment when I was unknown at the age of 19. At the time, I still believed in bareness and moral relativism, but only now I can remember the crowded smiles of the people I'm irritating - and numerous, long complaints about the others.
Much of my learning can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into an apartment can be anything that goes from nervous to completely frightening.
It’s tempting to joke: tell me where you’re from, if you like mid-year and where you think about Corbyn, and why “I really don’t love or hate Marmite because it’s really just a sweater I HAVE to find out from my room.”
Take a breath.
And also help others to breathe - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, not the ones you don’t want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they’re sharing switches.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail invitations, place for leaflets and places of entertainment, but they are also places where people dress up and repair their underwear.
Related: Don’t even imagine starting a university while you’re in a relationship
The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many apartments consist of a culture of walking from room to room, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you the promise to say, “I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so that I can recover the energy I spent talking to you.”
Try to sense when a student buddy is tired of socializing — and maybe send a text message to the door instead of clapping.
When it comes to squeezing: squeeze.
A guy in my student apartment thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Friendship through Bread.
As you start college at the peak of the bakery trend, knocking people’s doors with a chocolate chipboard and presenting yourself seems to be somewhat less strange, less “welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile when I ask you a personal question.”50
Providing self-made delicacies is a great way to make friends.
Your partner will feel obligatory to talk, and they may continue to combine your face with a tasty surprise.
It really depends on whether you know how to cook.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat stoves are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Of course, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you only take a drop of milk for your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It is possible that they will give you permission even if they boil inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to treat it more maturely than my cottage buddy who mixed the detergent with his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You don’t have to melt so that people don’t get to sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial dick sucking up a boiler.
The girl in my corridor asked her neighbors if they could play drum and bass music more slowly, because it was three in the morning and she had a test in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally silenced at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before putting her own music on the pavement, closing her door and leaving for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband moved to the same apartment as you?
Or vice versa, wouldn’t it be incredibly annoying if you were to keep your home partner as your future spouse, you’d hit each other, divorce, and then you’d see her every day and possibly lose all your common friends to her.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot partner isn’t really your future spouse, you might even try to talk to your subordinates.
In the moment when you realize that someone has left their keys unlocked in their room, the boundary between sneezing and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good fit is fun, but it can be cancelled in a moment.
You can give a useful and fun lesson on safety by hiding something - but never confuse someone's room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and dip the keys into a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't attach their property to the ceiling with a cinnamon as much as twice.
A racist attack on the home of foreign students in Kitee - a reception centre house destroyed in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out in Kitee, North Karelia.
Unlike the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation facilities of minor asylum seekers, but the dormitories of foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Kiteen Evangelical People’s Centre.
The windows and walls of the accommodations in the village were broken with racist markings, such as hackers, and a metal object was thrown through a window of the accommodation, the East Finnish police said.
According to Luukkayen, who was responsible for youth social security education at the National Police Office, there were an estimated 10 people in the building that was targeted by malicious violence at the time of the attack.
“There was a weekend and adults are free to move, so part could be elsewhere,” Luukainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities have been housed on the National Pistol.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All those who were in the confused building have an a-storage.
Part of it is studying in adult primary school, part is in professional studies and part is studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is the so-called permanent residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The East Finnish police are investigating the attack as damage and a violation of the home line.
According to Luukka, on Monday, the students had an informative event, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one wants to leave.
We’ve had 20 years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this has happened,” Luukainen says.
It is said that the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The perpetrators were suspected of at least three men and they were on the road in a light passenger car.
I think this is the highlight of the youth weekend, as this topic has now been on the surface.
There’s nothing more serious than that,” Lukainen said.
Also in Salo there is a collapsed hospital, which is planned for a reception centre.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported on MTV’s website on Tuesday evening.
The wall of the hospital was painted with a hammer and written in English "You are not welcome".
A criminal report has been made to the police.
Reference 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state stops Y-Boat for Karya - passengers in their nests, "very idiotic"
The Y-train, which runs from Helsinki to Raasepori Karja, will stop in March.
The news angered the passengers arriving at the Helsinki main railway station in the early morning flight of the train.
In particular, the downhill strikes targets, Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality, said.
It is quite idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and the workers need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot be anything but a political will or a lack of it.
Bengtström said in an interview with HSTV that he would be coming to the capital by tractor.
There are also changes in trains elsewhere in New Delhi.
The H- and R-lines that pass through the line are combined into a new R-line.
Purola's position in Järvenpäa and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be deactivated.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR released information on how the Ministry of Railways will purchase trains in the next contract period.
The contract period changes over the course of the year and the cancellable routes are throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will be later approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström considers that the state train cutter is a short-sighted operation.
Let us make the same mistakes that were made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance.
The Y-train is also used by non-raw-sporters and skiers, as it is fast and exceeds multiple stations.
Annina Pöyr<0xC3><0xAB>, a former Polish woman, has been harmed by a train to the fate of those who travel farther from the city.
“It’s especially sad for those who have to plan their journey again,” he said, as he hugged the Y-train.
A little relief is promised.
There will be a new train connection to the beach route, which will replace the Y-line in the Helsinki District Transportation (HSL) area, i.e. it will take you to Kirkkonumme.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. practically for the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now starting to explore the different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, HSL’s Managing Director.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y-train in about a million years, the ministry of course much more.
By closing the next R-line leaves between two stations.
Instead, the number of trains in Ainola and Saunakallio doubles.
The whole country has 28 small stops and numerous routes.
The Ministry no longer buys train services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train times are reduced on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
With cancellable flights, more than half a million trips are made per year, with a total of about nine million trips purchased by the Ministry of Transport.
The new agreement is intended to bring annual savings of 12.3 million to the state.
The value of the contract is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote in his book The Timeliness of Capital: "Marx is worth familiarizing"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his 1867-1894 paper The Capital, written by Yrjö Hakane in the book Marx’s Timeliness of Capital, published today as the former president of the GDP.
"They're going to be taken more seriously now than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx’s estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, of internationalization and penetration in all spheres of life, of the concentration of capital, and of the growing role of monetary capital and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly far-reaching.
The author of the book based on the Capital Seminars organized by Hakasen is also the Professor of Aalto University, a respected financial contributor, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is up-to-date "now and forever".
However, isn’t the former director of the Research Institute for Industrial Life and the Delegation for Industrial Life a Marxist?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today the social sciences are diverse and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and a literary teacher.
“The common perception is that the history of aatheism tells us about the wrong opinions of dead men,” Korkman begins.
The truth is that Marx’s predictions went wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions that lead too far from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman thinks.
However, Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical establishment.
“The most important thing about Marx is that he asked good questions,” he says.
Again, we are discussing Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
“Marx may be able to inspire anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of the technological transformation,” Korkman said.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is no help for Marx.
In his opinion, capitalism was a case of hopelessness that should only be stopped.
However, Marx considers Korkman to be familiar.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't read," Korkman says.
“The Malays and the Trotskyians and the other Laity hated each other all capitalism, but even more.”
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without years of ideological and political pressure.
“Every social scientist should get to know Marx’s world of thought – like other classics,” Korkman says.
U.N. calls for war crimes in Sri Lanka
The U.N. calls for a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, AFP reports.
The United Nations report on the Civil War of 1983-2009 came out on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the Tamil rebels of war crimes.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
There is also no precise information on the number of victims.
In particular, a major attack by the armed forces in the last months of a long war in 2009 should be thoroughly investigated, according to the UN report.
The report accuses the Sri Lankan Armed Forces of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely to be the victims as men as women.
The rebels, according to the report, are guilty of forcing civilians and children into fighters.
According to the report, both sides are guilty of murder.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to conduct an inquiry itself, but will not allow the establishment of a U.N. court because of foreign judges.
In the English yo-examination, social media was scored
On Wednesday, there was a long foreign language in the academic writings of the fall, which was mostly English.
His English skills were tested by more than 16,000 chefs.
In the experiment, he was able to write the subject even on social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of 150-250 words in English could point to the publisher of the magazine’s advisory board.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish chair of Leelia.
He had to ask for advice on how parents should be able to look at things from the point of view of young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects, one of which had to be chosen.
"It was the most difficult of them," said Mia Lybeck, an English lecturer at Porvoo High School in Sweden.
The third issue was just a quote from former President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso.
The fourth issue, according to Lybeck, was very nice.
It had to write a fire speech on why companies should hire young people to work.
“At least in our school, we have practiced writing speeches,” Lybeck says and assesses the entire experiment as “milk normal.”
In the Finnish - or Swedish - English experiment, we were able to answer questions about texts that, for example, discourage adaptation to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The writings of the autumn will continue on Friday, when it is time for the second domestic, i.e. Swedish or Finnish experience.
The exams are normally held in lessons, i.e. the attitude of the employees does not affect it.
The Graduate Board urges coca-Cola to find the right transport connections on time so that they can get to the trial.
You can also get extra time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
Theft of arms trade in Oulu
In Oulu, a shop in the Kello district was robbed on Wednesday morning.
Police say the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering commando.
He's a normal man and he's about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
The case is being investigated as a robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support groups from elsewhere in Finland
A protest against the government’s cut-off decisions will hit the centre of Helsinki on Friday, police predicts.
According to preliminary data, up to 10,000 people can arrive.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK alliances will meet at the Railway Station at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
In turn, the task of the police in the work is not only to carry out alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the flow of gigantic protests.
The roads leading to the railway are closed to motor vehicles for approximately 9.30-14 hours.
Only alarm vehicles will be released in the area.
Traffic in the direction of Hakanieme is interrupted from the Kaisanieme Traffic Circuit, from the west direction from Mannerheim.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki police station, Chief Commissioner Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least it seems enough.
I don't take a stand on police work.
According to Kujala, supporters from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki as a result of a statement.
The police don't tell me the exact number of patrols.
"Some degree is coming, but as a rule, we will be able to do it ourselves," Kujala says.
Police are calling for private cars to be avoided in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst amount of traffic extends from the Hakanieme level to the nuclear centre.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning until the beginning of the day.
With other demonstrators coming from Finland, many order buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They will not be released to the railway station.
The buses are basically a long way off.
The end of the trip will then have to walk to the protest site,” Kujala says.
The state of mind will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From the police point of view, this is also a positive aspect.
The problem of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally in the hands of these large crowd gatherings, is now partly taken care of by itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that there may be tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to go smoothly.
The people are ordinary workers or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, Finns are reasonable and peaceful people,” Kujala says.
On Friday, local events will also be held in different parts of Finland.
Friday's expression of mind is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these colors and expressions of mind?
The great expression of the trade unions on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, it is not a very good reference point in Finnish political history, says Martti Siiseinen, Professor of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It’s no wonder that the Ay-Movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise hands in front of the government, says the Easter.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the Finnish corporate tradition - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard drives are lacking in contract law.
Here are a lot of features that ay movement is really trying to get on your knees.
At the same time, the Ay-movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the ay movement does not even have the support of all employers for Friday’s mental expressions.
The new is now the sharp divide that is made by the expression of the minds of those who wish to participate in the demonstration by the Ay movement.
Unemployed people from different parts of Finland showed their views in the parliamentary house in November 1993.
If Friday is looking for a point of reference for the mental expression, it could be a gigantic demonstration of the unemployed, organized in 1993 in Murrostorstai, Siisäinen says.
In the middle of the deepest camp, Murrostorstai gathered 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Aho (Central) government was confused by the labour market crisis.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and the payroll organisations was never as bad as it was during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the gap between the government and the Ay movement is perhaps even worse than in the days of Murrostorsta.
In addition, Finland is now in power with the most bourgeois government ever, Siisäinen says.
The current coalition of governments is still interesting in such a way that it is so tightly right-wing despite the speeches of the fundamental Finns.
There were some elements of the old labour movement at the time of the investigation.
Thousands of protesters are expected on Friday.
It also stops public transport and potentially shuts down children’s homes and schools.
Even if there is no undivided support from the employers, it can become the largest in the years to come.
In the last few years, there have been around 300 demonstrations annually in Helsinki.
They're all set up.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Finnish Ay movement have been quite peaceful - although the way of action has been exacerbated in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, we are law-abiding.
Protesters are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, Siisäinen says.
However, in the late 1990s, there were new winds.
The culture of protests has changed.
EU membership nerve-wrapped farmers to lay eggs and police prepared to get rid of pigs.
The firefighter strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also striking strikes among other things by pilots and flight controllers.
Do you remember these hurricanes and protests?
Category: 1970s metallic and electric shells
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were metal coating in 1971 and power and electricity coating in 1977.
A total of 70,000 metal members participated in the strike.
The strike was suspended after a seven-week stint on the proposal of the Conciliation Committee.
The metalworkers received a 16% wage increase.
In the spring of 1977, the electric shock lasted 49 days and caused electrical outages across the country.
Murrostorstai 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people, many of whom were unemployed, gathered in front of the House to express their support for the work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighter strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strikes of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
In 1994, the police were caught in an egg harvest in protest against the EU by farmers.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," one of the slogans was heard.
There were tons of snow on the back.
The Helsinki EU summit in 1999 also prompted farmers to protest and burn July rainbows in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been living there was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy was threatened by lackey and nurses’ mass relocations in 2007.
The threat of mass expulsion eventually accelerated the negotiations.
Doctors on strike in 2001
"Physicians in the locust - forced," was the slogan of strike doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted for five months and gave rise to a lively debate on how lakots can endanger patient safety.
After the law, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for student support from the Senate in Helsinki to the House of Representatives in 2013.
Central Criminal Police Investigates Refugees Full of Finnish Refugees to Austrian Police
Austrian police have asked the Central Crime Police to help find out the background of the refugee gang registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees in Aisterheim, near the German border.
It is not known whether the truck was on its way to Finland.
Everyone who was in the fridge was in good condition.
We had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility is at the scene in Austria, says Central Criminal Police Commissioner Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, other passengers in a truck in Austria were more fatally injured.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by a bubble.
According to the General Radio, the truck is owned by the Finnish company, which first reported the cooperation with the Austrian police.
Among other things, the company carries out restaurant activities and its CEO is a foreigner, about 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two Iraqis have been arrested for human trafficking.
Refugee smuggler captain, former drug dealer, and hardworking businessman - the story of five smugglers
King of smugglers, violent boat skate, stylish missionary and a good taxi skate.
For example, such people practice human trafficking into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist working at the University of Trento and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and the book, written by them, will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present smugglers of human trafficking, present solutions and present smugglers from different portals of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll get them out of here right now.
The islands of Kerkenna on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for summertime.
Because of its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the journey to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometers.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-smoking captain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their snails, but a fisherman is more productive to transport people.
Emir has done this on a blue, ten-meter-long wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat collapses completely, it will accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir spends around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,000.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for customers across Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis revived.
Customers arrive from the mainland to Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir places them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
The food is provided so that the customers are just and just alive.
The accommodation costs about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 per night, and if the customer is left with the money in the middle, it is their problem.
We go to the water at midnight with the shortened.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for the day, and the next night we drive to Lampedusa.
Sometimes sailing is hard, and at 20 meters high waves, passengers cry and vomit.
At the end of the day, the human body has been cut in half an hour and Emir leaves for a return trip.
Emir wants to be scared of him.
That's why he's cheating on his clients and at least claiming that he's killing the scammers.
He tells the book that once the police caught him, he threw all his passengers across the court and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
“I pulled customers out of the neck one by one and threw them overboard,” Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
I've heard his countryman's got to be pissed at this.
I'll get rid of them right away.
You have to show them who's in charge right away.
It's a normal taxi.
Goran is a typical taxi driver in Bogova<0xC4><0x91>a in Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter motor is pulling its last and he has seen his best of days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi moves at all and moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogova<0xC3><0xB0>a is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers south of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where mainly families are rescued.
In the forests around the center, the men who travel without their family are staying in tents, slopes, and abandoned cars, what everyone has now managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for some reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia.
Some are also staying in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of its customers.
These are often overcrowded - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of crossings and weekly walks in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogova<0xC4><0x91>a area, a major hub of human trafficking, people are starving to death.
The Kythians of Goran are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and it's enough," Goran shouts.
According to him, Africans are trying to tinker.
Goran doesn't like it.
I hate you all the way.
First, the price is agreed on, for example, 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind man.
I don't care about money.
I just do my job and help people,” he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and will only charge 50 euros per person on the Hungarian border.
The journey is three hundred kilometers, most of it comfortably on the highway.
Members have been asking for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a big sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia a very nice annual income.
Serbia has ruled that taxis are not allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care: he knows the roads and paths and takes a kilometre from the border.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and sneaks out.
The Work of Mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese is called the Missionary, and it’s not just a nickname.
He actually has a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, where many refugees from the Congo are visiting, as well as a small center with the help of Congolese children refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are being transported from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
She shines her shoes several times a day and ensures that the rubber band of white trousers shaves elegantly under the low waistline of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercede, his field car and his three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from the Congo to Uganda and to Europe.
The customer will first call one of the five telephone numbers of the Sender.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, concealing the money loudly, and slacking in the mixture of smugglers crossing the border.
In order to obtain asylum seeker or refugee status, it is necessary to inform the Ugandan authorities that they are from, for example, the war zones in the north of the country and that they have been forced to flee their homes by violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Messenger arranges for the customer a new identity.
An old identity certificate is destroyed and another one is obtained for replacement.
The missionary’s contacts with the Ugandan police are helpful.
The client will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: to the asylum application procedure, to the NGOs, finally to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He calculates for each ladder separately: the application to the Ugandan police costs around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100, the handling of documents to the humanitarian organization about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 and the migration process, for example, to a European country, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,500-7,000.
Foliota and Ice Creams
Tom is a beginner smuggler, a former drug dealer.
A fourteen-year-old Irishman updates on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan taxi driver living in London, a French taxi driver, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human trafficking business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They drive the A26 motorway and try to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would have to go to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting there for seven years because of drugs.
When the taxi stops, Tom runs across his client’s highways to a resting place where the ducks sleep before continuing across the canal to the British.
Tom chooses the right truck... to make sure he's on his way to England... and not even to the Netherlands... and to cut off the seatbelt.
It's got to be done quietly so you don't wake up.
Sometimes a cup is included in the drink, but then the drink is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in aluminum foil, similar to the one in the kitchen wraps around a pan or oven.
It should prevent the police heat scanner from detecting a concealer.
Some use ice-filled sleeping bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the van and leaves the place in hopes that no one will rush to the rescuers before Britain at least.
The King of the Salamanders
Muammer Küçük is one of the world’s most famous human traffickers.
The rebellious Turks have been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of the illegal Mediterranean landings, which controls sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands money only to be received.
One of the new methods is luxury boat scams: the Turkish ports are rented for fun as if to take American or European families for a comfortable few days of tourist tours.
In reality, ships are loaded full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported for a fee of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,000-7,000 first from Istanbul to a harbour and from there to sea to Europe.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, for example in old industrial premises, until it’s time to leave.
People get into minibuses and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for signs.
When it is given, you need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden throughout the journey under the cover.
The Marine Corps can only observe how deep the ship is swimming, as no other signs of the crowd are visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers vomit and vomit, the better.
You will receive approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>53,000 for one luxury trip.
He does not take care of practical things himself, but hire captains, recruiters, guardians, hosts and other minor factors to handle the work on his behalf.
During the summer, there are at least hundreds of transports and Küçük makes millions.
He is believed to have bought through covert companies land, a pharmaceutical company and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a representative of the Democratic Party of Turkey and a medical entrepreneur.
Since then, he has apparently disappeared.

An American Olympic Runner Tells About Her Illness and Getting Prostituted
Three times at the Olympics, the new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1,500-metre runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton writes in his book Fast Girl about quitting his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the top of the competition and ran in the races for the second best time.
In the end, he panicked.
He ran straight from the start to the top and defended his leadership position on the ground running.
150 meters before the painting, however, his strength reached.
He fell to the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself over the line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from biased mood disorder.
Her brother Dan had committed suicide years before Sydney's races, and he himself felt enormous pressures of success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no economic problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strangers.
She also urged her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He said he spent his money on luxury.
One of Hamilton’s explanations for prostitution was also that he needed similar adrenaline drops as he had gained in his competition in public sports.
Favor Hamilton later found out that he had two-way mood disorder.
The former star-runner’s double life came to light in late 2012, when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the third-highest in the world at 1,500 metres at the time of 3.57.40, but remained last in the Sydney Olympics final.
World Champion cheered when the Federation placed the Norwegian ski slope: "Directly"
Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of suitability in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have retreated from the sports contract over the summer and autumn of last year.
Even though the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been suitable for multiple world champions and Olympic winners.
As a result of the contractual conflict, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the upcoming World Cup.
The decision was made thanks to double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the Alliance had put the snowballs on board.
"Thank you for pointing to the backbone," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working on behalf of the Federation sponsor,” he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously want to be part of the season's national team so he could advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent the alliance, which will also take care of future generations, and not leave one athlete alone.
At the same time, he recalled that the alliance has given Northug both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been a part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released a statement on Tuesday in which he said he wanted to compete in the Norwegian colours in the next season's World Cup, as well as in the World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen has won a total of six World Cup medals, two of which are gold.
He was in the team that won the Falun Gong last winter.
The Shield Day of the Translators is also celebrated in the Nordic Country
On the 25th of September, we will be organising a kick-off in various restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the Torch Translators Shield.
The aim of the day is to emphasize Finland’s high-level food expertise and low the threshold of leaving the restaurant, as well as to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that not all high-level restaurants are focused on the capital, but there are top restaurants in Finland that are reviewed and rated by an impartial operator.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of Schildkröten restaurants and the organization.
In the Nordic countries, a restaurant will be held in Vaasa at the Fondix and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, the Old Town restaurant participates in the Shield Day.
The event has also received significant attention internationally.
The event has been decided to become one of the most important international events of the organization, which will be held on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland continues to be the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-magazin: The Chancellor of Justice on the Establishment of Kauhava Reception Centre
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre for the former Kauhava farms currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the critical infrastructure of the crisis, which is at the disposal of the Defence Forces and its partner, Finnish Special Networks Ltd, is still in the region.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that, according to a private person, placing a reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests related to the area and airport of the former Air Force Base, the effect of which has not been ascertained in the preparation of the reception centre.
The case states that, in the case of Kauhava field, negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed, among others, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and the Minister of Defence’s Chief Minister Arto Rädy.
The private person declares to the Chancellor that the complaint is not about the principle of objection of the reception centre, but about the fact that the planned place in the former residential area is wrong.
The Kwahava Municipality dealt with the reception issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea
The administration means that the immigrants and the people here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented in the evening to the journalists after meeting the presidents of all parliamentary parties at their official residence in Mäntyniem.
According to the president, concerns about the management of the refugee situation brought all participants together.
He considers it worthwhile that in Finland, the government and opposition parties are able to discuss confidentially the ultimate issues.
Especially in these moments when we are faced with great challenges.
According to the statement, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea.
It is hopeful that the dialogue will develop.
If the situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia will be able, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tensions in the Baltic Sea.
He said the NATO issue was also included in the debates.
The President did not take a position on the labour market.

Media researcher: Oatmeal Takes Big Risk
According to Zipilla, communication requires a variety of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one channel among others.
This kind of direct speech channel is also needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in the parliament.
Sipilä did not yet wish to assess how often the Prime Minister’s repeated manner of television and radio talks comes.
According to the Civilian, speeches may not always be transmitted in the future via Yle channels.
If other channels sign up for the channel, then let's look at it.
Now we're going to use this channel tonight, Sipi<0xC5><0x82>a said.
According to Zipilä, the economic situation in Finland is so serious that it requires television and radio talks for citizens.
This whole matter, which we are talking about now, is quite complex and requires a longer reasoning.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Sipilä found out.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also see it in Yle Arena.
Lemons take a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Cipilä’s television speech will not talk more generally about the government’s involvement.
Is it an attempt to tighten the right to define the public debate and to reject the public debate’s agendas? said Anu Koivunen, a professor at the University of Stockholm.
I would like to remind you of Mr Soni's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are not interrelated.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media has been distracted by the announcement of Sipilä.
It would be strange if the media did not respond.
The styles of communication of political decision makers are not declaration matters in democracy.
The role of media representatives is to make a definite effort to ensure that political agendas are not taken as given.
According to the experience, television talk is a big risk to Sipilä.
The speaker should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set out in his speech.
Is there more available today than what we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in different tones, in different ways, or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only an addition of the same old one, you have to wonder why such a big elephant was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
At the same time, take this risk in mind, if this is not a particular situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be labeled as a message by politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle’s interests or the general line.
A veto from the spoon
What the Prime Minister does not say is also important in the future speech of the civilian, the media researcher stresses.
In the evening, we need to look closely at what Sipilä is missing and what is not,” says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the audience, the TV talk is a veto from Sipilä, because this is how it can convey its own view without sounding loudly.
This way, the message will get a large audience without a journalist filter, unlike in a newsroom where journalists can ask critical questions.
The squirrel ignores the media and speaks directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media misinterprets the speech because it is not possible to ask specific questions.
According to the audience, it is very important how Sipilä appears on the TV - currency sweat, whether the hands are swollen.
He compares the Civilian to the figure of a father who now tells the people what to do.
If you know how to perform well, it can work.
The situation is different than when the government would inform you about something, because in this person it is as if you are speaking directly to another person.
That’s what Obama and his partners do on a regular basis.
Really exceptional.
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to the public as truly exceptional.
It hasn’t happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The investigator believes that the Prime Minister wants to make Finns sympathetic to the pressures ahead.
On Friday, the NGOs will organise protests and strikes against the government.
Left-wing President Paavo Arhinmäki said on Twitter that Sipilä could consider his speech on the state of the nation in parliament a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow discussion of the speech.
SDP President Antti Rinne (sd.) once again announces that it is challenging the CIPLA dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
Six months of the election.
You can’t hide indefinitely, Rinne wrote on Twitter.
9-Year-Old Boy Found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of the meeting.
The son is LOOKING AND KNOWLEDGE, the son’s father updated his Facebook page.
The Indo-Finnish police station will also confirm the matter for Ittalhehde.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later that night, he was no longer in contact.
He thanked all the people who helped him find him.
Thank you for your contacts and observations over the course of these hours.
The update was distributed more than 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed in violent wildlife of young people: You cause anger
Kurdish freelancer Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook that appeals specifically to young immigrants.
Makwan Amirkhani called for a heavy speech against the street fights among young people.
Born in Iran and with his family in Finland at the age of five, Amirkhani has so far won both of his professional games in the most prestigious UFC freestyle series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking him to view an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account, where young people are fighting in the most violent ways.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed with the wildlife of young people.
At the age of 26, Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
You keep kicking the ground floor, sitting on top of the other one, and hitting with your eyes without thinking about any of these consequences, what will happen to you when you're making the ugly videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people seen in the video are immigrant backgrounds.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner, Jarmo Heinose, combat videos have been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
Exactly the fact that you're killing yourself on the street.
You are making life difficult for so many other immigrants here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani recalls.
Amirkhani reminds us that in Finland there are sites that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been quite a lot of these incidents.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be visiting here for a long time.
That’s a slightly different way to thank you for being here,” Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they are sometimes the subject of someone’s racism, then you can blame yourself for it.
Now, think a couple of times before you join in on one of those, you guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action contributes to racism.
You're going to make me hate something I don't like.
After all, you have things pretty bad and you will not improve them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its stance on savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK President Lauri Lyly said on Twitter that the NGO is considering its position on Monday to present an alternative savings plan for the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the STTK told the government that it would submit its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap, which Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) has demanded.
Akava's President, Sture Fjäder, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if the SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
This would, however, require the SAK to soften its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, the president of the SAK, commented on the matter on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK's office will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lylyn, the SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market gap" and that, instead of compulsory, active parties are in need of agreements.
Lyly recalls that the proposal for a social agreement by the Prime Minister of the Government of Zipilä did not apply to the SAK.
Sipilä had previously suspended the negotiations on the social agreement when the SAK did not agree to commit to the goal of a 5% productivity target.
Comment: The Great Demonstration Threatens the Eagle - "It's a little funny to stick a stick"
I think it’s a little weird to wear a pin if you already have a matching paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies in the employee camps according to the layout.
Is it going to make the government a mess, or is it going to make a deal with it?
On Monday, the Allied leaders of the SAK rested their holy hatred towards the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with arrest.
The fear spread to them.
The OAJ has threatened the closure of schools and daycare centres.
On Tuesday, the OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, STTK chairman Antti Palola (sd) appeared in a concerted manner.
He said that he had contacted the government and that Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) called for an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity lobby.
President Akava Sture Fjäder (cooker) rushed to announce that his suit papers were ready.
Initially, the SAK office did not belong to the yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is hard to deal with when the Allied leaders just ordered to inject the country on Friday.
Eventually, however, Lyly announced that the SAK office will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market gap".
In order to create a joint proposal for the employees, the SAK should be inclined to adopt the 5% productivity target.
It is no wonder that the Palola STTK has good relations with the Sipil<0xC4><0x81> government.
The right hand of Palola, Jukka Ihanus, the head of the STTK, previously served as a special assistant to the Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinieme.
Palola said that the government’s ay-skills have been improving all the time.
It’s a coincidence or not, but Palola’s exit took a bit of a break away from the Finnish standings, whose skeleton is characterised by AKT’s Marko Pirainen (sd).
I think it's a little weird to wear a nipple if you already have paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18:00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia calls Finland a bad host: ‘This must not happen again’
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticized the Helsinki Council meeting.
Russian Duma President Sergei Naryshkin says Mongolia is better hosted by Etyj than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, a session of the General Assembly of Ethio started, where Naryshkin made extensive comments on Helsinki’s July celebrations.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians on the European Union's sanctions list, such as Naryshkin, to come to the meeting - a matter that the President repeated to remind journalists.
We believe it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not be repeated, Naryshkin stressed, according to the Interfax news agency.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin’s criticism was directed at the United States, where he was also blocked.
The sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin said.
The Russian delegation arrived in Mongolia without any complications, so Naryshkin continued to mock Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary General Assembly will proceed constructively and with the most positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have any obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva, who leads the meeting in Ulan Bator, who has already spoken with the Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
The Closure of the Real Playoff: "Paints in the Strict"
Matpara and Lukko are continuing their cow holidays today in Hakamets, when both are on fire on the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicted that there will be no actual painting celebrations in Hakamets today.
Yesterday, the killer went to KalPasta in Kuopio with a 3-2 lead win.
The climb was masculine, as last season's silver team was at their worst of the two goals loss.
Tuesday's lock was a bit more slippery.
Blues, who had been tactically caught by the Rumalians, had a round of zero points, and a loss of 2-3 points.
Hard game, goals tight, if any playing a similar game as last year, Lock-Attacker Janne Lahti predicted the layouts on the tracking pages.
The killing has formed a fairly playoff nightmare for the Romanians.
In fact, in the previous two seasons, the Matchpaar has fallen within the Luko finals.
For both sides, the solution requires a decisive seven matches.
Last season, Lukko took a break from the series already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three sides and over.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups except for paint guards.
Yesterday, both of the fighters are going to have a blast today.
With the death penalty, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bear, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski among the Lukko tops.
Perspective: Awful play in <0xC3><0x84>ss
Sports director Hopeola wrote a follow-up that was inappropriate for head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote the film Rocky, in which he himself played the lead role.
The submarine sensationally placed the heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed on the field.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title.
Thirty years after Rocky's first morning, Mika Toivola wrote Pori's restless ash story.
An unnamed and hand-in-handed bootpack advanced to everyone’s SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous, but persistent, Rocky-like supporters.
There were White Indians, Porin Mattia and Pele Peluto.
In the drop games, players dyed their heads red and cut off the irokes.
She became a blonde.
J.P. Jalo called coach Neumann.
You didn't take the beaten silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
Writer Hopeola believes that the novelty of this season works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
The man who works as the sports director of <0xC3><0x84>ss has built a dungeon against the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been sneaking around like Rocky pigs at the slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamän, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparisen are somewhere other than disc playing.
Hopefully, Rocky VI will be played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Stone has crossed the Iron Pillar with Sean Connery.
Written by Hopelola in Rocky, Ironhawk is just as ugly a performer as Connery would have been in the original 1976.
There's nothing else in the Rocky Mountains than a nickname.
The Iron Pier's game philosophy does not include skating and small-arms hunting.
He appreciates the hard game, but there is a different thing to play hard like a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Asians took over the head of the Killaran Jere Kärjala.
He got 2<0x2B>10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve it.
I do not accept such a game, and it does not belong to the hockey team, the hot Iron Curtain roared after the game for the Nation of the Hundred.
The team for this season is strangely built.
There are trainers, veterans, cops, and scouts.
There are practically no key players at the best age of the game.
It’s no wonder the coach has complained of a lack of skills.
How much have you been able to influence player procurement, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season affect procurement and, unfortunately, the situation in the market was somewhat diminished, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
The surface under the cyte.
The 1953 model Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to the place of Hope for a sporting event.
Men's contracts end in spring.
The balance of the Aces in the three leagues of the season is equal to the number of losses in the score of 1-6.
Hope wouldn't have been worth writing the script.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have nothing in common.
Olga Temonen performs for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yeah, I'm playing my husband's friend's mom in the movie.
Usually it feels crazy, the actress and producer Olga Temone laughs.
She has been married to former Apulanna bassist and director Tuukka Temos since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but now for the first time Olga is acting under the direction of Tuuka.
The role of Olga in the early years of Apulanna in the film “You made us beautiful” is the drummer Sipe Santapuk’s mother, Sirkka.
The circus shudders and supports his son, even though this father, Kristo (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be a sound of reason.
The more I get to know my real role model, the easier it feels to play.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuka for trusting me with a role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the twin has come a lot closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, and texted.
The circus has helped a lot.
We have gone through many different angles throughout their history.
Fortunately, the circus also understands that drama is drama and the truth may have to be colored a little.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become Finland’s largest band.
In the '90s, there was a lot of sleep and a lot of anxiety.
There was a very low probability that someone would really succeed, but Circa had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuukal about this youth before the movie plans.
However, the parents’ stories have been slightly different from time to time.
So, if you’re a 15-year-old teenager, how much do your parents really know what you’re working on?
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuuka, known as the famous skier of Heinola.
Olga was an ordinary and kind girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
At the very least, he could have secretly loved it.
According to Olga, he has worked so much with Tuuka over the past 10 years that a large joint project is not afraid.
Everything has always been super good.
Now the entire production team is going to Heinola for a month.
A couple living in Iit, however, will often drive home overnight because of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We will rule for the entire month of Heinola.
They have welcomed us very warmly, just asking which streets and when to be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 has become the most expensive movie in Finland
Timo Vuorensola’s Iron Sky: The Coming Race film has a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17 million.
The film begins in October in Belgium.
Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to Iron Sky: The Coming Race will be Finland’s most expensive theater with a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17 million.
The title of the most expensive film in Finland was Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
Angry Birds animation will also rise after completing Iron Sky 2, as the film's budget is over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Filming of Timo Vuorensola and Tero Faraway will begin in October at AED Studios, near Antwerp, and lasts for eight weeks.
Timo Vuorensola will be leaving for Belgium next week.
The huge budget is not scary.
I've been so sick!
I have such a relaxed file about the script, because I know exactly what kind of record it should be.
Everyone in the team feels that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
While time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
"I'm more excited, and I can't wait to be shown this leff to the public," he told Iittalehde.
Initially, the budget for the film was estimated at 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
The budget is big, but it's a big stoor.
However, the film should be caught at 100 million because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything has been so tightly twisted that there is nothing loose.
The film’s production company Iron Sky Universe has launched a crowdfunding campaign and a loan to be paid at an annual interest rate of 4-8 per cent.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
At the latest two years later, the company will pay back the loan.
The action film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junttia or coolia?
Big logos return to shirts
Recently, the breasts of trendsetters have been decorated with large logos.
Even some time ago, fashion-conscious wearers avoided clear and large logos like the Crocs in their own words.
Advertising a hoodie or t-shirt sign was seen as quite a junt.
Times are changing.
Sport has become a real megatrend in fashion, and so have old, well-known sports brands such as Adidas and Nike rose to the coolness wave brush.
And as so often before, the boundary between humor and trend is distracting: if something is already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, the trendsetters were surprised by favoring as much boring basic clothes as possible as a way to stand out from the masses.
Now, instead of the grey basic collar, it is already placed on the bottom of the cupboard with the logo of the manufacturer in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas’ recognizing track network characters, favorite team game shirts and New York Yankees clips have made a comeback in the thirteenth century.
The Calvin Klein logos on the edge of the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend also seems to be shifting from sportswear to luxury brands.
For example, the breastfeeding of Versace’s root pockets makes it clear what type of clothing it is.
Would you be ready to showcase your logos in your dress?
A Russian politician published a statement: I haven’t been trapped in the tank door for hours!
It is alleged that a special incident took place in Nizhny Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015, a presentation of Russian war products, was held.
In recent days, Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Russian Emergency Ministry had to remove large-sized Zotovs from the tank cover for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page in which he appears to be shaking the armored vehicle door in a very good mood and, at least, based on their pictures, it's not about any catching or getting angry.
Full of nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't get into a combat tanker, but it was a BMP-3 scrambled tanker.
I'm a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel. I've served in Ural.
I went in there, looked around me, and I came out peacefully, Zotov said Komosomolskaya to Pravda.
I wasn’t stuck and I didn’t really spend five hours in that position,” he said.
Zotov told the Russian military television channel that he admired Russia’s new technology in the exhibition because he was himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the wagons, I loved our technology.
And I came out through the back door, he said.
I went through all the tanks.
And even in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all tanks and all tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also complained that the journalist who wrote about it was stupid.
One fool wrote and all the others repeated.
There was no such thing.
I went in, and I came out.
“I’m tall and racing, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere has happened,” he told Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photos of the alleged seizure have been published, even though a total of 50,000 people attended the exhibition in a matter of days.
The claim of Zotov’s seizure started with a story on Bloknot.ru, in which Zotov was told that he was hanging out of the tank hole while trying to shoot everyone around, and that he would eventually shoot anyone if he could not get out of the surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a sequel, where the organizers of the exhibition shared their views on what had happened.
Everyone is just accustomed to the fact that soldiers jump out of tanked vehicles quickly.
But the deputy Zotov, due to his large size, simply stopped when he came out.
But he did not sit there for five hours at all, Aleksandr Pisarevski, the coordinator of the exhibition, told Bloknot.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilän mine in Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company, Agnico Eagle.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand bottom.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
Below is the foaming process of neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water.
In general, water is either pumped for re-use as process water or is discharged to the environment via the surface lighting field in accordance with the authorisation.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the sewage meets the current licensing requirements.
The other substance does not damage the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leakage has not been detected to cause structural damage to the pool patrol structures.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred regular employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns of cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is largely in line with the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation has undertaken structural reforms covering Finland in order to address economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime allowances and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contractual system as well as for unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank chief economist Pasi Kuoppamä, we agree on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF considers that there is a lot of condolences to the government's actions, but on the other hand, there are also warnings about what should not be cut too much.
Such are, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki tells Taloussanom.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts for Finland a growth rate of 0.4 per cent this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
Danske predicted today in its new relationship forecast that growth will remain zero this year.
The IMF is a bit more optimistic this year.
They could have been on the basis of the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was growing slightly in the summer, Kuoppamäki says.
Less attention has been paid to the weakened confidence of the industry or other so-called softer meters.
The difference, however, is only a few decimal places.
Nintendo Recovering from Death Appoints New Leader
Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, worked under Tatsumi Kimishima to start working on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the launch of a successful Wii console.
The 65-year-old Kimishima’s choice is not a big surprise.
He was one of those names that was highlighted by Iwata as possible followers.
Kimishima is a safe choice for tracking Iwata’s footprints, said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research.
Kimishima’s job is to take Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but so much so that it doesn’t eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers are arriving in Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency acknowledged the disappearance of hundreds of children each year.
According to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, the Swedish Immigration Agency reports that hundreds of minors are missing in the country every year.
Chief Inspector of the Immigration Agency Juha Kannelmaa explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear "underground" per year?- In Finland, a total of 156 asylum applications were submitted in 2013 for minors who came alone.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The background of the hearing may be the fact that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be aged there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they seek asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were dismissed because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last year, he says.
Is the number growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 solitary minor asylum applications.
The total statistics on the missing minor asylum seekers this year are not yet available, but the number of minor asylum seekers is therefore known and it has increased significantly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What about those who have received a translation decision?
Do they include, for example, the “small labour market”?
This is difficult to assess by the Immigration Agency, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the repatriation decisions, Kannelma stresses.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo (cooker) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registered country seekers.
He's taken action on the matter.
At an EU-internal ministerial meeting on refugee issues, Orpo said on Monday about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see photos of the devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkosen for TV and radio productions, who has lost his ability to work due to illnesses, is now on sale.
Nina Mikkonen, the wife of Mikko, sells equipment at Huuto.net, which used to be the most advanced tools of professionals in the industry.
The online announcement was first reported by the online newspaper Ittamakasini.
Nowadays, a large part of the equipment has been left to the fore of technological developments.
In the digital media world, television shows are no longer being filmed for the Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there are people who are interested.
Of course, the hardware is no longer up-to-date in this way, but these are also needed as long as there is an old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of fans - collectors and designers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkosets are trying to move away from their current Stormland home.
We can't take all the goods with us anywhere.
For a short time, I started inventing and looking at where the goods were delivered.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
Its own use for TV and radio devices is no longer available.
In the aftermath of a recent stroke, it is clear that a man who has had a long career does not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen notes that now only goods and equipment are being sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkose’s actual work was archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to the box office to collect films and other material from the Storm.
Traffic threatens to get worse: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers today will decide whether they will expand their power plants in connection with Friday’s state of mind.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the period of the demonstration to be held on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief Trustee Pekka Hirvonen says the ear is big on the field.
Night-time and reverse-cutting are badly flickering drivers, so the government’s plans to cut the plugs will stir up resistance.
However, Hirvonen thinks that stagnation of traffic throughout the day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stops on Friday, public transport is virtually completely stopped in the capital area.
According to VR, trains do not travel between morning and evening on Friday.
On Fridays, there is no traffic, no traffic, no traffic.
Trains departing before dawn will be driven to the station.
According to HSL, most of the buses remain on the trail.
AKT members will be absent from work on Fridays from three in the mornings to three in the mornings of Saturdays.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by the chairman, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo estimates.
Repo says the HSL is unable to say exactly what bus times are on Friday.
Wage organizations will organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Rautatientor on Friday from 11 to 13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with a tear gas.
The incident took place at the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move forward into Europe, according to the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border yard.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, also fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police have also used water projects against people.
Muslim boy detained at school in Texas - a teacher thought the clock was a bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was detained after a teacher held his own clock as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to showcase his electronics production.
However, one of the teachers looked like a bomb.
The police were called to the scene, and the situation eventually ended when the boy was taken in handcuffs to the juvenile detention cell.
Muhammad has not been found to have claimed anything but that he had made the clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a lie bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police said the clock appeared to be a “film bomb”.
The clock is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital display, between which there were wires.
The incident happened last Monday, and Mohamedi was sentenced to three days of school leave.
His father is angry about the case, and the U.S.-Islamic Council is wondering if the case is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Labour leader refuses to sing a national anthem in Britain
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
Members of Corbyn’s own Labour Party have also joined the criticism of the right-wing press.
This has offended the people, Labour representative Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial was in honor of the British Air Force's fight against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official statement and emphasizes his respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We all owe a huge tribute to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement starred.
Corbyn's choice as party leader has divided the ranks of the Labour Party.
Particularly among the MPs there are those who fear that he will expel moderate voters with radical views.
Corbyn supports unilateral deterrence, the cessation of austerity and the increase in public spending.
Corbyn is expected to appear in Parliament for the first time today as a party leader during the Prime Minister's questioning hour.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
This week, Cameron tweeted Corbyn’s election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted on his own account.
The cause of Minnesota's family death remains unclear - family father awaited trial
South Lake Minnetonka police have recently investigated a family death in Greenwood, Minnesota.
The five-person family was found dead in their home on September 10 and a few days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father Brian Scott Short, 45.
When he first shot his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage.
Dead for days now.
The family was found after school was concerned about the child’s absence.
Based on this announcement, the police went into the house for an inspection visit and found a huge house from all sides of the Short family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A millionaire and a successful company
South Lake Minnetonka Police Officer Michael Siitar's case is still pending.
The motive of the blood vessels is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his assets for nurses on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 StarTribune interview, Short told the site that there are four million different visitors per week.
I have received 50 purchase offers from the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, in the fact that Short’s family bought the house from Greenwood for <0x24>2 million in 2011.
The house is advertised on the property site in Zillow as the dream of the car rental company: the house has not only 12 rooms, also enough garage for eight cars.
The legal case is underway
According to StarTribune, the family's father was waiting for a court case.
Achieve Test Prep, which offers a variety of preparation courses, had challenged her for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short’s website did not delete comments deceptive of the prepaid courses, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short’s transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cakes
In addition, the three owners were awarded at the food event with the Finnish Hippo Month Horse Owner Award.
This is great, Loir commented on his honorary plate.
Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000.
The artist legend Loire was still confused by the success of Fabrice Duo in the big competition.
I still don't think it happened.
According to Loir, the trainer of the successful horse Korpi gets complete peace of mind when working with the horse.
Decide where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'm holding my ass, Loir laughed.
The NHL star's stunning elegance - "The greatest gift ever made by the athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated <0x24>10 million (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.7 million) to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to the hospital news agency, it is the largest individual donation made by the athlete of all time to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to assisting the hospital in another fundraiser for the next seven years.
Subban signed a <0x24>72 million deal with Canadiens a year ago.
Subban’s donation amount is therefore significantly higher than its <0x24>9 million annual donation.
As a reward for his donation, Subban is given a lounge room to carry his name from the hospital.
The Canadians have already made a significant contribution to local hospitals.
A year ago, long-time captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars for the same pediatric hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum of money for another large hospital in the city to get the PET scanner needed for cancer screening.
Japanese coffee shop can order a wife for dinner - serves food only bikinis and essu on top
Theme cafes are a tough thing in Japan.
The markets already have a goat cafe, coffee shop, vampire cafe, hali café and now a sister cafe.
It strikes the lone, the trailblazers and the hungry.

The website provides your spouse with all the information about length and always press on which mattress they prefer to sleep.
150 million vehicles will soon be connected to the network: the attacks against the security of cars will begin
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the industry, Intel said in a statement.
The board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
Researchers at ASRB will conduct ongoing security tests and inspections aimed at standardizing best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB’s research findings.
Gartner, an international research and consulting company in the ICT sector, estimates that by 2020, some 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles will be able to consume, create and share online data.
“We can and we need to improve car cybersecurity,” said Chris Young, head of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish security-related best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB committee the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>52,000 in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been expected to rise for years.
The car is finally starting to be in sight in Finland.
Ford has released RS data now that the automotive world looks at the Frankfurt Motor Show.

In Finnish, the price is also interesting, initially it is said to be EUR 52,000.
The car is already available, however, when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you in its announcement.
Kia presented two new features at the Frankfurt Motor Show - the new Sportage and Optima
More important than two innovations in the Finnish market is certainly the new fourth-generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to capture a larger wing of the ever-growing market.
Created under the direction of Gregory Guillaume, the new European Design Director, Sportage is more round than ever.
The axle space and the outer sections have become a centimeter there and the car is breaking the air more efficiently.
The engine range is still the same in its main features, but it has been added to the 1.6-liter turbo, which develops 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be reported in more detail on sales revenue.
We will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive in the spring of 2016.
Already before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the news doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a brand new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of top middle-class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise level and higher equipment.
Starting with the 1.7-liter turbodiesel and the 2.0-liter petrol engine, the Optima will be available.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when the Optima GT comes next to them with a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine.
At the same time, with its revenue, the sale of Optima-farmer begins.
Chisu returned to the barns - exploded in bold whistleblower
Singer Chisu is present at the concert Life for a Child with other domestic stars.
In an electrically connected sleeping pad, it is necessary to display an open neck hole.
Asu presents beautifully the singer star siro belt.
The whole is crowned with a gold metal work and a red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the singer, who became a mother, had to endure pregnancy with light exercise and yoga.
Chisun's daughter will soon be one year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
Back on the bench and getting up in front of the general public after a long break doesn’t really excite me.
“I’ve missed everything about music,” the singer said.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release a new and at the same time a fourth album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the making of new songs.
At this stage, wondering if people will find my new record, Chisu is thinking.
Kim Kardashian’s maternity style amazes again – now shows breast
Real-TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives speeches one after the other.
She presents her pregnancy and breastfeeding adorably in sexy clothes, last night at 1 a.m. American time, when she left the pole with her sister Kourtney Kardashian and her husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent to the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the shirt when flashing flashes.
The last time Kardashian was wearing an Amazonian maternity suit, he went to a friend’s house for dinner in New York just a few days ago.
The accessories were highlighted by black overhead shoes.
The third special maternity allowance is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when there was a pregnancy.
The Hard Laws of the Painting World: No Home, You're Lonely, Competition is Terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to express the idea that the modeling world would be pure glamour and champagne celebrations.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk about a model shop.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if you had posed in the costumes of top designers in the previous season, the new season starts with castings again.
And every season in the field comes new, fresh faces, competing from work with concrete.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go for years, as the accommodation is a hotel room or apartment, in which the fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are too young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There is not just one type of weight loss.
An agent in New York may ask you to lose pounds, but then in Paris, you're said to be too thin.
Getting a job is always a risky game.
During the fashion week, models and designers are always together, and function as a support network.
When the fashion week ends, the difference is fading.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are impressed by the fact that everyone thinks the work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models also want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors who have some role.
But in the work of the model you can also express yourself.
Yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
In New York, fashion shows are currently being held, where designers will unveil their collection next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays an unfamiliar Apulanta musician in the film
In the film based on the early years of the Apulanta band, Roope Salminen presents the founder of the band, Antti Lautalaa.
The shipyard was founded by Apulana in 1991 with Toni Wirtas, but separated from the company in 1994.
This is a big challenge for me, because I am a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I present a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughter.
I didn't want to meet the real Antti before the descriptions, because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly more unknown to people from that band, so I think it's good that I'm just learning his playing style from the video.
I don't want to imitate a person.
A man who is completely empty with Roope Salminen and Dogs is not the source of the role.
Punk managers come from a man by nature.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, I'm sure many people saw the first taste, as well as if they've ever been to our galaxy.
Our performance has never been anything small, but always going to be full.
The main actors of Tuukka Temose's 1993-2004 bass in Ajulanna were released today.
The core group of the band, which became known to the public, is presented to the general public by quite unknown young actors.
Rumpali Sipe Santapaukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtata Tatu Bluesalo bassist Tuukka Temo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a clue about his upcoming blast last night, when he told Snapchat that he was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of his career.
Yesterday, Roope posted a picture on Instagram of his new look he had to make for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the leukaparra, has turned her face into a silopox, and dyed her brown hair into black.
Psychologist Advice: How to Tell Children About Refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell their child about the situation of refugees in Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to speak out loud, advises psychologist Ferdinand Garoff, member of the SPR Crisis Group.
Younger children deserve to be protected, for example, not letting them watch the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can keep them spinning in mind and distressing, he says.
However, if the child has encountered the news on television about refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth taking the floor.
It is good to visit the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he or she asks.
The child’s fears can be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent imagines to be afraid of.
A child should not be frightened in vain, even if he is annoyed and frightened.
The younger child closely monitors the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also feel safe.
Older children are likely to encounter a conversation about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
It is good for parents to take the matter with them if the child is thinking about it.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Together with our children, parents can think about how our family feels about it.
After all, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different perspectives of upbringing - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as much as possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult things, the child is given a model of how to deal with the challenges ahead in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
Your powers at the end?

Perttu Pohjola got a soldered apple balloon in the middle of the summer.
It only ravaged profits and second-rounds until the collapse of the Tampere railroads in late July.
As the slave went through the base, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his guards to be protected from the veterinarian for a while.
Explanation of the extinction survived in the constellation.
The horse had a sore throat.
The disease was not the slightest, but it took two medications to stifle it.
Because Apple's Ballosalama had to be in light exercise, Pohjola says he was positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was the second SE tampa in Turus during its record time after Tarunwind.
Apple's Palloslama was at a very high pressure when it had been able to drive normally for just a few weeks.
That little slope of attention at the end was understandable, North says.
The coach assumes that the proper competition has made the race hard.
The horse's virus certainly went ahead of it, and hopefully it would have even improved.
Apple Pallosalama has been so-called humorous horses.
When she didn’t like it, she could have been thrown out without getting sick.
On a good day, instead, a flash of lightning broke out from the oracle, so that the opponents were amazed.
At a slow pace, competitors will not be able to hit the Ballolam, from which even hot-blooded rides are fired.
In the hopes of the north, there is a swamp in Vermosa.
The difference, however, is how Apple’s Ballochalam agrees to it.
It is quite difficult at the time of departure and may even drop under the bush of the departure car and that kind of thing.
I hope the slave would be quieter than leaving Turu.
Apple's Pallosalama is able to come out of the ring as well, and we're going to drive with that victory, the coach promises.
This is why you can’t get rid of useless iPhone apps
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple’s iPhones may be removed sometime in the future – but not all.
Apple is likely to remove some of its own programs from iPhones in the future, CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple iPhone has a number of programs that are relatively rarely used: For example, FaceTime calls, Lehtikioski, Health, Börsen, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a mandatory update to iPhone phones, although it is needed only for Apple smartwatch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone apps work firmly together with other apps.
There are other programs that don’t work that way.
So over time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating because the company does not want to waste memory space on users’ iPhones.
Eurozone inflation fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, 0.1% year-on-year, according to the European Statistical Office Eurostat today.
Price increases led to lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its pre-evaluation of 0.2% slightly down a couple of weeks ago.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat’s forecast for base inflation was 1.0 %.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than it was a year ago.
The average inflation rate in all 28 countries in the EU was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 percent.
The biggest increase in consumer prices in the euro area was 1.4% in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest when prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent, according to the EU harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains a long way from the European Central Bank (ECB) target, which is a 2% price increase in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1 per cent for the euro area this year.
Next year, the increase will rise to 1.1%, the central bank predicted in early September in its new inflation forecasts.
US Fed tries next to tighten monetary policy
The next U.S. recession will start at its fastest rate in less than a year, but more likely within three years of the Fed’s long-term interest rate hike.
And in the financial market, the downturn in turn begins before the next recession.
The Fed has indicated that it may start raising interest rates by this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can press on at its fastest pace by next autumn and at the rate of the financial market before that.
Or at least that’s what happens if the world’s largest economy and financial markets are functioning as they have always been — and if they react to the Fed’s tightening of money as they used to do.
Such conclusions have been concluded by the German market research strategies of Deutsche Bank in London, Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle research.
The bank distributed a more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international major customers last week.
The strategies developed by the study and the report do not believe they know exactly when the Fed will start raising its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market thereafter.
Instead, they present economic statistics with cool facts and calculations on how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and after the Fed’s interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they are looking at what key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or different pattern as at the time of previous interest increases - and what might result from it.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial market are now in a better position to withstand the rise in interest rates than ever since the 1950s.
The beginning of the decline may not be
Over the course of last summer and early autumn, the Fed’s monetary policy leaders have pointed out that it is time to rise interest rates.
The first interest rate increase for more than nine years can occur already this week.
The matter will be resolved on Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called open market committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds management rate in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but consecutive small 0.25-percentage increases, which led the Fed to increase its interest rate from 1.25-percent to 5.25-percent.
The financial market symptom began in 2007 with the U.S.’s most risk-focused housing financing difficulties, and a year later the financial crisis escalated into a global judgment day nightmare.
A major decline occurred in 2009.
The last time serious financial markets and the real economy began to counteract more slowly than has typically happened since the Fed’s previous interest rates.
Similarly, the tests were then harder and more expensive than ever since the 1930s.
Deutsche’s strategies have traced the rises and declines of the world’s largest economies as well as the reversals of the financial markets since the 1950s and from the early 19th century to the early 19th century.
The Fed’s interest rates and their economic and financial impacts have been reflected since the 1950s.
It has been less than a year since the first interest rate increase began, usually less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The financial market exchange rate has ended within a year or two from the start of the Fed’s interest rate hikes.
The Fed has increased and decreased its steering rate by a dozen different cycles since the early 1950s.
Each time has differed from one part to the other, and the times are relatively small, so on the basis of them it is hardly possible to conclude with certainty about the effects of subsequent interest rates.
Strategists remind me that many things are different this time around.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The causes of the financial crisis may not be undoubtedly identified, even through decades of research.
But the three factors that led to the crisis and increased its gravity seem to be quite clear:
1) The Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other world’s largest central banks held their regulatory rates too low in the 21st century.
They placed the traces of the technobubble, and at the same time grew the next one.
2) Over the decades, the amount of debt accumulated in various parts of the financial and real economy, and already too much, has grown even greater than the impact of monetary policy oversized by central banks.
It was the biggest debt crisis in economic history.
3) In particular, insane debt financing, which is almost exclusively packed into the financial economy, has injected into most parts of the financial market the biggest bubbles in economic history, from stocks to real estate, debt securities and commodities.
There is hardly any doubt that the financial market, which has risen to the heights of ever more complex debt trees, has been in a rarely dangerous and volatile state, as the Fed and other central banks last set interest rates upwards.
The financial structures, which have been linked to debt trees since the valuation bubbles, did not last until the start of interest increases and the cost of debt financing had risen.
Risks occurred during the financial crisis, followed by a major downturn.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategies do not predict what will happen next, but give the subject of the tunnel, for example, by mentioning the following factors:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Indebtedness has not been insane for a long time as it was ten years ago, but now the indebtedness is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the financial and real economy debt has not been diminished, but now in different parts of the economy the vello debt burden is much heavier than before the financial crisis or half of it ever before.
3) The liquidity issued by former central banks as a leak and cheaper has largely been left to the financial market and has delayed key types of securities and assets to their most expensive either the peak before the financial crisis or at any time.
Strategists are not only in a latent mood with financial market warning signs, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from decades of harder recession to that model than it has ever been.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but similarly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are relatively greater than before the financial crisis, as the Fed begins to tighten its funds.
Perhaps the future picture of Albert Edwards of the Societe Generale strategy of the French bank is not as strange as it may suddenly seem.
For a long time, he has trained the Bank’s international investor clients in the following full versions of the Fed:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles explode – and soon it’s time for the Fed to shut down the financial bubbles with even greater QE cash flows.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are for the HP business service side, the company says.
In November, HP will be distributed to Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a company focused on business sales, and HP Inc., a company focused on consumer PCs and printers.
HP’s highest number of employees was in 2011, when it employed 350 000 people.
In October last year, staff was reduced to 302000.
The company records <0x24>2.7 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 billion) of one-off costs of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be deducted from 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The consumer side reductions will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60 percent of its employees will be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business in such a way that none of its customers is responsible for more than ten percent of its turnover.
In the second year, its three most important customers accounted for 65% of their turnover.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System on iPhone After Apple Update Release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, your phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some people had problems after this installation when the "Software Update Failed" error message appeared on the screen.
To overcome this, users are advised to either wait for the worst basket to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include uninstalling applications to get status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitated the process with a new tool that proposes removable applications and then reinstalls them when the update is complete.
It is worth making sure that the phone is charged or close to the charger during the update, so that the battery does not run out.
If the charge level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to progress, because if the battery runs out in the middle, it can lead to a violation of the update.

It’s also worth making sure that you’ve reviewed our list of all the things you need to do before downloading, so things don’t go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from them if they do, however. iOS 9 brings with you new features, such as a much smarter personal laundry system, and the use of a smarter personal laundry provider, iPad’s helpers, and a huge laundry.
Yle: Minister Berner has served in the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (center) has served as a member of the board of the tax haven company.
According to the above, the so-called tax planning is related to the company’s activities.
This is about the Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company, to which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says he left a resignation for membership in May this year.
I checked it, and it's enough that I've left a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place on an agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Ylen.
Membership after merger
The holdings of the Swedish company Kährs are managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parkowner who merged with the Finnish parkowner Karelia-Upoflori in 2012.
Berner served in the Karelia-Upofloor government from 2010 to 2013 and after the merger in the Kährs government as well as in the Luxembourg company.
According to the above, Kährs’ ownership is through a multi-purpose ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he has accepted the membership of the Luxembourg-based company Kährs as the second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been part of the Karelia-Upofloor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was searched for a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my own task was to take care of the realisation of the interests of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that the returns on the capital of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s ownership is not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of the tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Reception centre maintained by the company opens in Espoo
In Espoo Otaniem, the company opens its first reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 residents as of this evening.
The number of seats can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Immigration Agency establishes the reception centre on the property of the former Rescue School.
The activity is maintained by Luona Oy, which specially focuses on the production of health care and health care services.
The city of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the security arrangements of the centre.
STTK prepares alternative workforce coercive package
The STTK is preparing alternative packages for the government’s workforce.
The organisation also hopes to include other pay-per-view organisations.
President Antti Palola said that at the moment the focus is on Friday.
Alternative means of lowering the price of labour will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola noted the organization's board meeting on a pause for journalists.
Palola considers that the Central Economic Union (EC) is not prepared for debates.
Economists of the STTK have calculated that the government’s change insurance package costs an estimated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million to the employer, while the other half of the package is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,700 million.
I don't know if there's a terrible passion on the side to have a discussion if there's a 100-percent relationship on the side.
Palola: Negotiation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government will have to give its own package of communication to the parliament and start preparing for reforms.
The fire did not take a stand on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, the dialogue with the government exists, and it has been constructive for him all the time.
In the field of the STTK, especially Sunday surgery is a painful place, according to Palola.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation with which it would implement some of the crackdowns.
According to Palola, there is no warming in the STTK to prepare an alternative package with the SDP that held the matter.
Wageholders will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the workforce package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the salary of the first sick days is cut, overtime compensation is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STTK stresses that the central organisations have invited the employees to express themselves, and that the purpose was not to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder
The President of Akava, Sture Fjäder, welcomes the announcement by the STTK on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STTK will now be on the same lines as Akava, because Akava has already for a long time figured out alternative models for government proposals.
Feder hopes that the SAK will also be included in an alternative package, as without the SAK, the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
According to the upcoming SAK led by Lauri Lyly, the President of Akava, Sture Fjäder, hopes to prepare a proposal as an alternative to the surgery.
Antti Palola STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akawa said on Wednesday that it had long been preparing its own proposal, with which it was ready to negotiate the goal of the country's government to achieve a 5% competitive rate as an alternative to cuts.
Akawa has always been ready to negotiate, and we have been writing alternative models for government proposals for a long time.
We are ready to view the terms of service as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Feder hopes that the SAK will also come to the Akava lines, as the STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together on a model for the government and employers of the country,” says Fjäder.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, common coal, talkoot" - playing bingo while talking to Sipil<0xC4><0x81> in the evening
The Green Left of the University of Tampere
The University of Tampere Green Left Vivan bingo coupon for the evening.
In the past, the Prime Ministers held exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä uprising and the wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak to the nation very exceptionally about the state of the Finnish economy on the Yle channels on Wednesday evening at 21.05.
Similar to the previous speech of the Prime Minister, it is necessary to go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister during the famous radio speech, marking the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä uprising.
After that, the president and ministers held several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the fall of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the law on train operators with a televised speech.
A solitary call, a monarchist monarchy
The speech of a civilian has been arousing criticism and speculation all day long about what will happen.
Left-wing president Paavo Arhinmäki said on Twitter that "Sipilä could consider his speech on the state of the nation in parliament a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow discussion of the speech".
According to the Greens, "a single call has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP’s Erkki Tuneoja on Facebook condemned that “monarchist monks: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for them.”
SDP President Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "Semi-year is coming.
There is no mention of the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public Service (Public Service)
According to the State Council, the speech of Sipilä has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, this was commented on by the President of the SAK Lauri Lyly and the CEO of the EC, Jyri Häkämies.
It is generally criticised for the presentation of Sipilä's speech.
We thought about it and found that it is the public service’s task to promote publicity throughout Finland, according to Yle’s publisher Ismo Silvo Yle in the news.
As We in the Time of Tammelo
The speech also aroused consternations.
When the evening comes, dinner is enjoyed in good time, the children are dressed and dressed at their best.
Mom puts on a cute dick and dad settles the knot on his neck.
At nine o’clock, the TV will be quieter than it used to be in the time of Me Tammelo,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipila also explain in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in the tax havens of millionaires hiding their capital, who have drafted laws of charity for their other tax evaders and at the same time claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut when the state has enough money?"
From what Sipilä says, one assumption is made by the green leftist Viva at the University of Tampere.
It has been posted on Facebook along with a bingo.
Do we hear tonight about the same boat, the common coal, the living debts and the team?
Coupons and pens are ready, at 21.05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries reject Russia’s proposal to exclude al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected a Russian offer that would have allowed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to renounce power, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan that would have left al-Assad in a stylish way after some time.
The Western countries, however, did not adhere to the proposal because they believed al-Assad would collapse within a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russia’s ambassador Vitali Churkin listed him in a bilateral discussion three points of the plan: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to immediately get in touch, and the resignation of al-Assad’s power had to be carried out sternly.
I know Churkin.
We may not necessarily agree on all matters, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told him what I did there and he said to sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we have to do, Ahtisaari remembers in the Guardian interview.
Diplomats did not comment
Ahtisaari said he had transmitted Churkin’s message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Churkin did not confirm the contents of the discussion to the newspaper, but according to Ahtisaar, there are no two words about it.
The U.N. diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari’s claims, but said al-Assad’s forces had already committed several massacres at the time, and the main opposition groups refused all the agreements they had left in power.
Sir John Jenkins, the former head of the British Foreign Ministry’s Middle East Department, is hesitant about Ahtisaari’s words, as he said Russia was at no point prepared to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Russia has officially supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Churkin spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about Churkin's speeches, I would have answered that I wanted to hear from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, in that case, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin’s desire to hold power with some supporter of al-Assad.
The Refugee Stream of Our Own Actions
During the Ahtisaari talks, around 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the number of deaths at the beginning of the current year exceeded 220,000.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own actions.
I see no other option than to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the invoice that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari told the newspaper.
Asylum Seekers Arrangement Centre in Turquoise Tower
The Asylum Seekers Organisation Centre, planned by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The centre would be set up for the empty Tower joint building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Sanomat of Helsinki reported on Tuesday that the Board of Directors had already decided to submit the school building to the Ministry as a space solution.
According to the vice-president of the Tornio City Council, Sauli Hyöppisen (Va.), this is not true.
When the whole board was not assembled and part of the body wanted an official decision, we decided to convene the board meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he clarifies to the STT.
There were 36 of the 43 delegates at the meeting.
Thirteen delegates were opposed by the Centre.
It could be expected to be a positive decision, Hyöppen says.
Mayor Timo Ouiisen said the city was not contacted on Monday, and a quick response was made.
An estimated 500 asylum-seekers will be accommodated at the same time.
The expert has checked whether it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of meters from the border, so it would also work in that sense, Aufiainen says.
Sipil<0xC5><0x82>a still hopes for an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), halving the public holiday funds would only take care of part of the government’s goal of lowering the price of labour.
However, the Government would welcome the alternative package if the labour market organisations were able to agree on it.
Sipilä told reporters in the parliament that he had not been in contact with labor organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for a substitute for the government’s reported workplace crackdowns.
If such an agreement arises, we will certainly welcome it as part of the package as a whole.
Sipilä believes that halving holidays would serve as a means, as it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government’s planned Sunday cuts.
The labour market organisations could agree on the cut-off of holidays, as they have been registered in the labour agreements instead of the law.
The government is expected to inform the parliament next week of the work life crackdowns as a State Council communication.
Citizens say the proposals of organizations should be aware of this in advance.
There is no final backwards either.
Legislative work starts at that time, i.e. the train is on the move and it becomes more and more difficult.
It's a good time.
It doesn’t take long for such things, if there is a will, the spoon shaped.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, converting final and helatorstein into unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working time.
In addition, the salary of the first sick days is cut, overtime compensation is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation across trade unions, which has sparked strong criticism.
Workers' unions are organising a major demonstration on Friday because of the actions, in addition to which several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmaj Lake Authority approves expansion of the juicy store
The Board of Governors of Tohmajärvi unanimously approved the extension of the stock of Nordic Koivu Oy.
Criticism was caused by the fact that the project is larger and more expensive than originally talked about.
The busy schedule is also busy.
It was also a little surprising that the need for investment was not known a year ago when the previous enlargement was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock by 400-450 square meters was approved for the investment programme, but the funds will be decided later in the context of the semi-annual report.
While the agenda was still talking about the investment of EUR 150 000-200 000, Erkki Ikonen, the technical director of the meeting, said that the price will be estimated at EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenues to the local community.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment for rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justifies.
Place in Joensuu for the Karjala language
In the past, the city government has undermined its strong position to bring cattle-language clanes to the city centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and appropriate for the election of the peasant tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared as the capital of the peasant language because it has no historical grounds and the peasant language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the area of Joensuu belongs to more of the eastern Savoia tribes.
After the new decision, there will be no cattle-language farming in the city centre.
However, the city of Joensuu is also ready to use the livestock language, for example in information centres and tourism marketing, with a good case-by-case consideration.
The same attitude the city recommends to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-speaking municipality, it is also advisable to use the livestock language in a sparamic way now that multiculturalism is living and changing strongly in North Karelia.
Karjala language is still a distinctive feature of the county, as well as the image of Joensuu as a forest town throughout Finland.
They can be used well in a wide variety of marketing activities in the province.
Breakdown of train connections cuts the viability of the county
The cuts of the train connections will strike the province with a strong hand.
Transport links have a direct impact on the economy and competitiveness of the county.
And it affects whether you can live and work here at all, asks the mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen.
He also highlights air transport, which has also been continued on a number of occasions in the report.
It is important for the whole of the province that we cannot reduce our chances by means of government measures, as it is currently underway.
The impact of these disconnections on employment, for example, should be considered, Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of road connections creates an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services there are, such as transport and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, director of the University of Eastern Finland.
He notes that poor transport connections also affect the research department, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that the university’s marketing towards Western Finland is already difficult because the traffic connections are weak in the outer direction.
Currently, about half of the students from the University of Eastern Finland come from outside of Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by the direct train connection.
The river became one of the sounds of his voice
The view of the municipality of Joensuu on the provincial Siu ware project is apparently unanimous, but one of the sounds of the song is.
Pentti Keskisalo, a member of the municipality (sd., in the picture), presented the government at a land meeting to give up the entire project, but his proposal failed to support.
The Government approved the draft decision by the Mayor of Kari Karjalaise, which will be revised in early October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train ride from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger transport from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although one pair of trains will be less frequent.
There will be changes in passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains is left, but still five times a day from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
This is due to state savings.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ purchases for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely closed.
VR will develop new schedules by the end of the year.
They enter into force on 27.3.2016.
The boys climbed the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped from the place
The rescue agency released a 12-year-old climbing from the cliff to the roof, who could not even get off the roof with his own help.
The situation arose in Tornionmä Ketoti at six o'clock on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house, with no tiles to take to the roof at all.
It did not stop the boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys went down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, the others slipped off the site and the passers-by alerted the rescue facility to help the last one safely return to the ground with pull-ups on the roof.
FedEx’s profit doubles, lowers fiscal year 2016 outlook
FedEx reported declining results in its last quarter, and the volume of deliveries cut its year-round output forecasts, resulting in reduced demand for freight services and higher land services costs.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
Its share fell approximately 2.5 percent at the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening call.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the tax year to end next May to be <0x24>10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected <0x24>10.84, according to the FactSet poll.
The lower outlook came despite an average price increase of 4.9 per cent, which comes into force on 4 January, and despite higher additional charges beginning in November for heavy or large parcels on land.
The company said it expects profits to continue to grow from the previous year as they have cut costs, turnover has increased and e-commerce is growing.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "has a stable performance taking into account the poorest economic conditions expected, especially in production and global trade."
Plans for salaries for the holidays were announced the day after competitor UPS said it plans to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, about the same amount as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, the FedEx revenue was <0x24>692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The earnings per share were <0x24>2.42, which remains from the average forecast of <0x24>2.44. The 12 analytics survey was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover rose 5% to <0x24>12.3 billion.
In Zacks’ poll, six analysts expected <0x24>12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in international priority transport, which has stopped the growth of its Express unit’s turnover.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the unit’s turnover increased by 29 per cent, but operating revenues were in principle the same due to the cost of larger packages and their own insurance.
The revenues of the Express unit were higher due to higher basic charges, while higher labour costs decreased the business profit in the freight operation.
At the opening auction about an hour before the opening call, FedEx’s shares fell to <0x24>3.85, or 2.5%, to <0x24>150.15.
FedEx on Tuesday closed down 11% for this year and 17% below the June 11 record.
U.S. central bank decision makers are sitting around the two-day giant monkey table this week in a long-awaited meeting to decide whether it’s time to raise the lead rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
Congress has laid down a double responsibility on the central bank’s heels: they must maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
However, after the Great Depression, the central bank’s leaders have accepted that there is also a third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in the decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted. The decision on whether the U.S. economy is ready to be dismantled from the record stimulus, which has been nearly zero since the end of 2008.
While most of the data indicates that the economy is growing steadily, the recent collapse of the global financial markets may have made the pre-warned central bank officials even more conservative in terms of increasing volatility. We are afraid of how this would affect the inflation rate, if we were to join the Alliance.
"Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors to be monitored," said Lindsey M. Piegza, broker at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“However, I believe that if they are looking for a justification for leaving their own interest rates, the increased uncertainty in the global market is a valid reason to wait,” he says.
There is no consensus on the decision of the Central Bank, which is already generating nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg study, about half of economists predict interest rates will rise this week.
The financial market, on the other hand, expects the central bank to delay the rise, as according to the key indicator, the chance of growth is only around 30 per cent.
This refers to a decline in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers then manage to soften the blow by promising that the next raise will not happen in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, with a new figure of 16,599.85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank will keep its level this week, says John Lonski, Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group chief expert.
“It’s surprising that the central bank is raising interest rates right now,” he says.
If the decision makers raise interest rates, "they must see a lot of effort in their line to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that an increased level would calm the financial market, as it would remove uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank was raising interest rates by a quarter this month, taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation that would certify the stability of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that the liberals are demanding further economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest figure for seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the full-time threshold.
The increase in wages has shown signs of an increase.
Although inflation is still below the central bank’s annual target of 2 %, the central bank’s decision-makers say that access to it is the temporary effect of a significantly lower oil price.
The economy "recognizes even higher interest rates and also needs them, taking into account the tightness of the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, chief expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shocked last week as China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index fell by as much as 16% of its May record, as investors feared China’s slowing economy would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10 percent below its May peak.
For the central bank’s decision-makers, the myllerry of the market is another factor in the complex equation, which tells why interest rates need to be raised.
“Without these financial market events and recent news of China’s economic weakness, the decision-makers would tighten the level at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a specialist at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
“The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still quite unclear, and they have little information about the consequences of China’s events,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the international economy is not the central bank's main concern, so it should not, in principle, affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the federal central bank has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank’s influence has been immense.
In 2013, the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, suggested that the central bank could "reduce" an increase in the amount of money, sparked revolutions in the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to see next developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is “more of art than science,” says Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, said this month that "the central bank has previously over-reacted to the movement of the financial markets, which has seemed to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy."
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for an interest rate increase, and Lacker, a member of the committee entitled to vote, is an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings "despite its limited, recognizable impact on U.S. economic growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank cancelled these cuts.
The central bank should only prioritize economic stability during a major crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s Interest Rating Committee.
The last millerry doesn’t even get close to its level, Posen says.
“No one wants a situation where interest rates are feared to rise because the market is upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds a dual requirement and does not mention economic stability, and as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazilian Children's Health Organization Rio Grandesa Advertises Healthy Diet for Breastfeeders
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS has found a shocking way of trying to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies breastfeeding with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calories is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the child’s immune system.
The Seven-channel Sunrise program is a favorite among viewers, despite Nine-channel attempts to update the CEO's announcement on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson’s move to Canberra to inform the Liberal Party’s post-promotional announcements failed to increase Today’s spectators.
The Nine Channel morning program was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull knocked out Tony Abbott.
The rival program Sunrise, directed by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was trapped in London as part of its weekly series of international broadcasts covering Dubai, New York, the Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The median movement did not seem to bother Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise’s average viewership in five state capitals was 397,000, while Today’s number was 339,000.
Today’s average rose slightly compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has taken over Sunrise over the last few months.
Today averaged 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000 in August.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
As of September, the average Sunrise is 349,000 viewers, while Today is 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The winds are blowing up this morning, not in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news on Channel 7 was the 800-word series, featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing premiere.
The new drama series, which collected an average of 1,219 million spectators, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have been wondering if Thomson's popular series will be powered alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave it real certainty.
Seven Channel's The X Factor program was a strong favorite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning the The Block series (838,000) and the TBL Families series (726,000).
Seven had a double destiny on the second night of The Chase Australia series.
The first half-hour of Andrew O'Keefe's new screening program (17-17.30) gathered an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17.30-18) reached 623,000 spectators – enough for a small win from Eddie McGuire’s Hot Seat program (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia’s first half-hour viewer averaged 520,000 spectators, and in the second half-hour the number was roughly 720,000.
The average of the Hot Seat was 620,000.
The Chase Australia’s second night viewership drop gives Nine channel confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the number of viewers of the McGuire program.

The final trio agrees with dad that Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
Has the secret been revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski accidentally revealed who won The Bachelor series.
The woman's identity is kept under extreme secrecy, with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The remaining three girls don’t really know who got the last rose.
However, when discussing with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they may have been able to accidentally give a clue about the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final
All three women turned out to be skeptical about how Wood is a perfect man, mentioning his humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as the reason why they would like to be his partner.
However, when they were asked, “If Wood’s last rose is not for you, to whom should it go?” their answer might provide a revelation of who won the boy’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best alternative to Wood after themselves.
The relationship between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been uncomplicated since day one.
“From the moment I walked into the house, [Sarah] energies and Sam’s energies seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind for the whole series,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really close to the ground, it's fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
Mackay said last week’s home visits led him to realize that Wood could be “the right thing.”
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that obviously this isn’t just a game – I’m here with all my heart,” he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was apprehensive.
"I don't know if I can say it," he said.
I like the remaining girls as much, so it's the equation between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayn has many options where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested in him when he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked him about his impressive opening day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers as well as coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the swap bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league rebound dropped the ball in his first round when he won the Minnesota team 20-3 on Tuesday.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Hayne to return the next flight crew and took him to the race game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula’s true character also appeared in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of squeezing new entrants into the front porch in front of the other team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne in a post-game press conference.
49ers Specialist Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne Released The Minnesota Vikings Attacked In The First Game
This was certainly not the beginning that Hayne and her many Australian fans were hoping for for a man’s NFL debut.
Hayne was seen on the way out of the field after the crash, and he later told Australian radio team Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM at 104.1 that he hadn't been able to imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
“It was just one of those things now, you just have to think about the next game and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared her hackering to her 2007 Origin debut when a feed in her own painting area led to Queensland painting.
Overall, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posted a photo of her Instagram account with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun on the Siberian highway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was sentenced, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 killed in police shooting rubber bands against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd in southern Nepal, according to authorities on Wednesday.
Violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the region’s top official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fireworks.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber deposits.
Twenty police and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber linings known to have killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
The clashes in recent weeks have been violent demonstrations across southern Nepal, with members of the Madhesi ethnic group saying that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution are weakening their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal as the Tharus group demands its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed a treaty dividing the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been drafted since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating April earthquake killed thousands of people.
Legislators have voted this week on the constitutional clauses in Kathmandu, and the authorities have said that the new constitution could have been adopted by Sunday.
U.S. National Hurricane Center NHC says that south of Cape Verde has a 60 percent chance of a cyclone
A wide low-pressure dam, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands, has a 60% chance of evolving into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
The second precise low-pressure bridge, located in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60% chance of evolving into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami Weather Center added.
Google launches donation campaign to raise <0x24>11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has launched a donation campaign aimed at raising <0x24>11 million to humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees to come to Europe to flee war-torn and poor countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when publishing it on its donation campaign blog.
Instead of making the announcement, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabulli with her family at the age of seven, wrote of her own personal experience.
“Our journey included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis has escalated in Europe, people like my family desperately want to help.
The donations are made by four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save Children, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
According to Google, that amount corresponds to every donation made globally on google.com/refugee relief, up to <0x24>5.5 million, with a total target of <0x24>11 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War II is underway, mainly because of the four-year civil war in Syria that has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing wars from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight Loss Surgery May Help Lightly Obese Diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for type 2 diabetics with mild obesity can last at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"Obtaining mortality data takes a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is a weight loss surgeon who wrote the main article for a new study in the JAMA Surgery journal.
Various methods are used in weight loss, i.e. bariatric surgery to reduce the size of the abdominal sac.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the people involved in the study have been obese, and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
The ratio of weight to length is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the person’s BMI is over 30, he is considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, and gastrointestinal reduction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, to people with diabetes mellitus who were obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the people cut fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of those treated with non-surgical means remained approximately the same at 29.
36% of the people cut off improved overall and 28% partially.
For comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes improved overall by only 1% and partially by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood haemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels over the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c levels should remain below 7%, the researchers write.
Post-surgery haemoglobin A1c levels dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the treatment group, it remained stable at about 8%.
However, this better “glycaemic control” depicted by improved hemoglobin A1c levels did not reduce mortality over five years, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu with colleagues.
The study group also compared average results between two different types of surgery.
For the fifth year, compared to the group undergoing gastric surgery, the group undergoing gastric surgery had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), had decreased their weight indices more (7.4 and 5.1), had decreased their weight indexes (7.4% and 5.1), had decreased their levels of hemoglobin A1c and had decreased to 2,46%, and had increased their tomato levels (3.2% and 14.2 kg).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that although the study does not show surviving or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to longer lives in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people undergoing weight loss surgery were 29 percent less likely to die over a 15-year period compared to a group that had tried more traditional therapies.
While the new study does not show any improvement in surgical survival, Blackstone says the results are encouraging for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
“The results of the study are crucial precisely in that they show that surgery is safe for the lower weight index group,” and does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take their weight very seriously when the patient’s BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we wait too long before we take this seriously,” he says.
I believe that once a person has accumulated these genetic changes, which permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, the cancellation of the situation is very difficult.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees by adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to the violence in the refugee homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech, which he held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the present situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is also insufficient.
“Not everyone can come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised the action of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
“It is wonderful to care for thousands of refugees, but in the meantime it is necessary to think about long-term solutions: how to bring true peace and true development to these Muslim countries, especially through education.
The last thing is to think about how we can reduce killings in their land.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the U.S.’s violent response caused a chain of events.
“After 9/11, I sent my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is through non-violence.
“I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, children’s hand sanitizer swallowing has quadrupled
Intoxication centers across the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in the ingestion of alcoholic hand sanitizers in children under 12 years of age since 2010, according to the Georgian Poison Information Centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Institute, cases of ingestion of the disinfectant in children under the age of 12 reported to the poisoning centres increased from 3266 cases in 2010 to 16117 cases in 2014.
“Children are interested in these products more often and unfortunately a certain percentage of them will be subject to upgrading,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant intentionally, while some want to make an impression on their friends or respond to the challenge on social media.
YouTube has videos where teens drink disinfectant to get a cheap riser.
According to reports, teens have mixed the disinfectant into alcoholic water to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant disinfectant scents can appeal to younger children.
“The child doesn’t think this is bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most interesting (hands-on) are those to which the fragrance has been added.
There are peanut, grapefruit and orange-scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant can contain any alcohol between 45 and 95 percent.
Especially in young children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," Stephen Thornton, director of hospital care at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn’t leave a whiskey shot on the table, but hand sanitizer is left on display, and if children are interested in it, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four syringes of hand sanitizer in school, and was taken to first aid.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the limit on adult driving, says first aid clinician Chris Ritchey, who treated the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nahijah stepped down as he spoke and couldn’t walk when he arrived in the first aid.
Doctors followed her overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain damage, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
“It was really scary,” Nhaijah’s mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
The situation could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfection towels and remove the disinfectant from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been combined with deaths.
In 2013, two ontarion women died when they swallowed a hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undisclosed ingredient.
The health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredient.
In January, three four-year-olds in the northern state of New York planned to poison their teacher by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, police report said.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from his class.
The police have to prevent the plan from being "as a joke" and leave disciplinary measures to the school environment.
Huhumylly: Celtic has no conflicts
Griffiths dislikes talk of Celtic contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight place, but he makes it turn around.
Hearts fights against the Scottish Football Association on the charges of Neilson, and Warburton is guarded against January picks that may interfere with the team's unity
Dons raised their lead to Celtic by five points
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick led Aberdeen to a narrow win at Hamilton Pittodri Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the difference to Celtic by five points.
Griffiths Reduces Controversy
There have been rumors of Celtic's internal conflicts, but Griffiths passed them immediately. He claims that he and his teammates do not have any sense of working under a more careful watch as the team is preparing to face the Dutch series leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship championship match will upset the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition with the Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador, de Boer, said: "The Netherlands no longer showcases Celtic highlights and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
The people here can't just talk about Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They talk about the two teams together, and that is what they are interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and also other non-Scotlanders want to follow those games.
Deila vows to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to reverse the situation.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting drop in the Champions League was quickly followed by the loss of ten men to Aberdeen, who is now at the top of the series with the next five points difference.
However, Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes in the past, and we're going to get up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is going on.
We are, too, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters, because it improves the performance of the players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton warns of player transfers in January
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton commented just a few weeks ago on the possible destinations for January's moves, he's guarded against the most recruiting, confident that he doesn't want to confuse the team's unanimity.
As Brentford’s former boss said, “The window of December is very different from the window of summer.”
For the upcoming players in the summer, the adaptation time is the whole time ahead, as can be seen in our team during this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic’s interest in Michu suggests retirement
Swansea assailant Michu, whose name has been linked to Celtic during the transfer window, has suggested that he can retire after his contract with Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been having ankle cramps for two years, and during the summer he failed to find a new companion outside of Wales.
Hearts is ready to fight against the Scottish Football Association due to Nelson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team subsequently lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later cancelled, and this was the third red card convicted by Collum in the last eight months, which was canceled.
Neilson insisted, “I didn’t question honesty, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
Loyal Hibernian player was sneered after singing an insulting song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacelist.
The incident took place at a pub in Edinburgh’s Roseburn, ahead of the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a moment's drive," the attacker said, adding, "It seems safe to say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless I move to Celtic."
Tannadic government believes in Dundee United leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still believes in the ability of the management team to reverse the situation, but admits that the weakening of players must end.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the boys fit again," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy with the "successful win" in Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accesia, but managed to reach Adam Rooney's seventh consecutive league goal, bringing them to the top of the top of the table.
McInnes said: “There is no team that would have won anything, whether it was a cup or a league that wouldn’t have won games that way either.”
Unemployment of Scots remains the same as the UK’s total number increases
WORKING IN Scotland remained with 164,000 people between May and July, while unemployment across the UK rose by 10,000 to a total of 1.82 million.
Scotland’s unemployment rate is 5.9 per cent higher than the UK’s 5.5 per cent, according to the National Statistical Centre (NSC).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 people over a three-month period, and the number of employed is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 per cent in the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures: “The long-term plan of the government is to build the foundation for a stronger economy.”
Almost exactly one year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
Over the past 12 months, Scotland’s labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why do I testify to execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal interference, I will look at the man being executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'm sitting in a spectator's newspaper at Oklahoma State Penitentiary Prison watching Richard Gloss be executed with a deadly syringe.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I'm starting to sneeze this day as it gets closer.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since there are often more applications than vacancies, participants are selected through a compelling draw.
Oklahoma has reduced its media outlets from 12 to 5.
No matter who you choose, it’s cool.
I can't do it.
I’ll sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I’ve also established my own connection with him through the phone calls made over the months, as well as a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't have both a witness and a reporter, so I can't have a notebook and a pen with me to record what I saw.
All I have to do is try to remember all the details.
On Twitter, an Oklahoma reporter accused me of being disloyal.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, and you'll be able to participate.
I chose a reporter.
He admitted that "I could have put my word better" but still thinks that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said it.
I've told him that he can remove me from his testimony at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public will help the opposition to the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to the podcasts I made in the series.
I will not go through all the details again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Gloss is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would in any case make him a culprit.
But I believe there's a very strong chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
This is the point of view from which I see him dying.
I can't say I'm completely impartial.
There will be other journalists on the spot who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it's like to look like when the man I love dies unnecessarily.
Man pulled out of Canning River after water police chase
Canning Vale's officer stayed dry as he pulled the man out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to mislead the police in his footsteps went wrong when he found himself in a low, mute water just meters away from a policeman who tried to "shoot him gently back to the beach".
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for unauthorized intrusion into Beckenham.
When they found the suspect, he tried to fool them by heading for the Canning River.
However, he did not go too far.
“He was standing in the water saying ‘I’m not coming out, come get me,’” said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Sergeant Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to be cast, so he used a safer tactic: "the town police negotiation."
“Sometimes people do funny things while trying to escape,” said senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid swelling and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
He was unsuccessful in his venture, but inspired locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody says reporters tried to spy on him and threaten to stop the competition
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria’s reporters tried to spy on his deposits last year, and threatened to stop the race immediately.
He accuses reporters and Racing Victoria's immunity division of claiming that they have a personal campaign running against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tata's late rejection due to the day's treatment was the last nail.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation after Lidar’s unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has been keeping his tongue on the spy allegations for a year and a half, and did not want it to "look like jealousy".
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I’ve been silent about it for a long time, but sometimes it frustrates so much that everything breaks apart at once,” Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes I just have to react and live with penalties, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to get my head up and I want the owners to think I’m doing my best in front of them.
When they start thinking differently, then I don’t have to continue as a coach.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped a bomb in an interview with racing.com, in which she said that the donation department had tried to spy on her farm.
“Twelve and a half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in the room with a man — I asked him his name — and offered him a job with my bookshelf if he was to pass on information about what I was doing there.
Clearly, they think I'm a fraud.
If this is the case, then they should certainly divorce their lawyers, because they have failed in my arrest.
Robert Roulston, former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is going to be personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to join the team and perhaps transfer responsibility to other than coaches for what is happening in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so detrimental to the industry?
Maybe people think that way.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and push me away, and I don't have any doubts that what I'm saying right now might make them think exactly that.
But now I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it's upsetting me.
It's really upsetting me.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach’s frustration has increased with the long-term Lidar cobalt research, and late rejection led him to conclude that he could “throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for training the invincible champion Black Caviar, has called the racing day's rule of treatment "ridiculous" after a mucus or scab has been placed on a horse's legs, which is illegal.
“It’s against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put a mud on his leg.
It could have been a graveyard last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
It was the race day.
Moody may face a three-month ban from competition due to the race day funeral treatment, from which the suppliers started the investigation.
That's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
Driver convicted of traffic accident in Cobram detained
Police have arrested a man who was found guilty of colliding with a cyclist over the weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was transported by plane to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he suffered serious injuries when a car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with non-stop leaving in an accident, neglect of assistance, and other business offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Attacks Competitors in Button Claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the championship claims of two NRL rugby leagues that his team's rooftops would be part of the "liner".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said he allowed the referees to "stop" Storm on his side, when it suddenly won the final round in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely concealed his reference to Storm after he won the North Queensland Cowboys in the final pick on Saturday night. Bennett called the game "the showcase" of the rugby league and said that the two of them were not in Queensland.
Bellamy defended his team's clutches and said that they only focus on "contact" in the clutches.
Bellamy added that his confidence added two leading coaches to criticism of Storm, which means they are afraid of losing to the team.
"This always comes to mind - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about pressing when we lost to them 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defense systems or in our technologies all year long, and over the last six weeks we have only stressed contact in the clutches, and that has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he’s probably not used to losing, and so this was a little bit of a shock to him.
It’s funny how this always comes to mind at this time of the year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that the St George Illawarra Dragons coached by Bennett won the championship in 2010 by playing "silent".
Wayne talks about exciting rugby.
"He thought it was important to compare Saturday night to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn’t care less.
But now he has a team that is able to play such a rugby that we think is exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
This is the kind of game you want to play when you have that kind of player.
He brought it up half in 2010, now he wants everyone to play in his style rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I get more confident when they say things like that because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a response to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more punctual than the game played between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven’t seen it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting breakdown of the defense line and the lack of a goal?
For me, this is about lines.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm will be free this weekend as they have already won the right to a home game either against the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronella Sharks next Saturday morning in AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.
<0x24>200,000 guarantee to a Serb man for drug trafficking
The man, threatened by a potential life-long cocaine smuggling company in Queensland, has been released against a <0x24>200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked down 100 pounds of drugs on the Solay yacht, which arrived in South America via Vanuatu and sailed to Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting other defendants at the boat port all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs from the Toyota Echo.
While Maksimovic is threatened by a potential lifelong business holding company for the purpose of holding the amount of cocaine, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maksimovic tried to keep the whole amount in his possession and that he might have been in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
“He has strong ties to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In a criminal case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic’s mother and father, together, had offered a <0x24>200,000 guarantee to secure his release.
"After reading the voluntary certificates of both persons, it is clear that putting a <0x24>200,000 guarantee amount is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But it alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing before the court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted guarantees on the condition that he would hand over both Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and keep his ban on outdoor traffic between the night and the morning.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to attract pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl’s phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl while sleeping on this phone and then logged in to the network communication service, where Hogg received numerous ruthless photos of the children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing, and found it in the sleeping Hogg's hand.
The girl looked at the phone and found shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother about it.
When the police arrived, they saw five pictures, searched the computers on the site and found "careful" webpages with keywords that had been used to search for pictures taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this “to incite pedophiles” on the internet, before he “prosecuted himself as a policeman to intimidate them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it's an addiction - that he's dependent on people being intimidated.
He admitted that he had carried out a search on the computer but said that they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman in order to stop pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him pictures, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send more photos.
Hogg said he did this only for the purpose of feeding.
She said that after drinking, she's sick, and wants to see pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she yelled at her mother, shaking and crying.
My mother saw the unsightly pictures on the phone and then met the defendant.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the accused had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to the girls who looked her younger.
23-year-old Hogg, who lives in Ward Road Dundee, pleaded guilty to making or taking pictures of innocent children on 14 June last year. He breached his guarantees on 25 January this year and failed to attend court proceedings on 24 January this year.
Attorney General Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia not be included in the sex offender register, as it could be claimed that there was no "significant sexual element" in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence to October in order to have time for social action to prepare background reports.
Hoggy was granted guarantees in this case, but in other cases pending, he is detained before trial.
He was added to the sex offender's register prior to the date of the verdict.
Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe has given a wrong speech to parliament
Earlier this year, Africa’s oldest leader, Mugabe, fell to the speaker’s ladder.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spreads like a virus on social media.
Parliament's open-ended comments were also made by opposition lawmakers on the fact that they had been sent anonymous death threats, warning them not to humiliate Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they beat him up and suspended him with interim slogans as he delivered a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group leader Innocent Gonese said on his mobile phone seven opposition politicians received text messages warning them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
"The number that the message was sent is not answered, but the title of the message is 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the relevant Members that immunity will cease to exist in Parliament, and when they step out, parliamentary immunity will not be valid.
The group’s supervisor said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was “concerned” about the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard Reduces Up to 30,000 Jobs
Hewlett-Packard is set to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its reorganization and cost-cutting efforts in the business service business.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from the fastest growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
Expected job cuts will bring about <0x24>2.7 billion in costs from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP’s president and CEO, who leads the unit after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we will have a load of and deeper range of services that will help businesses move into a new kind of business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the growing needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual turnover will be over <0x24>50 billion, and it will “focus on producing unparalleled integrated technology solutions” for companies, the company said in a statement.
The company, which graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded in the 1930s to manufacture electrical appliances, operates in a garage in Palo Alto, called the "birthplace of Piilaakso".
HP has undergone a huge restructuring to survive the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. technology companies, and its distribution is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that strictly limited companies are performing better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates need to support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is now only September and assuming that his recovery is going according to plans, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In the best case, Wilshire will be involved in at least the next four games in England, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will take part in the European Championships next summer.
The biggest regret in this last problem is that Wilshere’s final season was strong after a single nipple, and he remembered his old sharpness before the start of the season.
"Such a disability does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing weird.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with her nipples or previous injuries she has had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to get back through, there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd shows that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since she debuted six years ago.
In addition, he has played 157 Arsenal league games in just 65 games over the last five seasons.
Looking at the wider Arsenal overall after the 2007–08 season, in six of eight seasons it has been one of the teams in the Champions League that has lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of witchcraft, but Arsenal believes their last season's improvement in injury status will continue.
“Sometimes when recovering from a disability, there may be an allergic season when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will be stable, I am sure that it will be, and that he will be able to do the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team as Arsenal starts their Champions League game against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night after playing for Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably on the initiative.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give breathing to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is the clear favourite of the F-Block, Maximin Stadium in Zagreb is the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 games since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night, with a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learnt from last season’s Champions League surrender to Monaco, and is motivated by a still distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup win.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rate of young men is higher than fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the highest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In the effort to tackle the problem Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the year 2015 for men. The goal was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study involved more than 2,000 high school and high school students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, a person’s chance of recovery doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his or her friends were “healthy”.
Similarly, those who were not depressed, the likelihood of possible mental health problems was halved if they had mentally healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this time of communication through social media, the style passes through the content and the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, joyful, and successful, even though in reality isolation prevails.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this happens at the expense of internal values - internal desire for personal growth and friendship - that affect our mental health more deeply.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money doesn’t really get any greater happiness.
Friends’ greatness was precisely that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which was clearly distinguished in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler’s numerous tributes, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross misses Rachel – the humor of these came from the realization that yes, men can be identified with all this, even though they often hesitate to explore their emotions completely.
As a Samaritans volunteer explained to me: “When I listen to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have really understood how even the slightest interaction with a friend can improve the feeling.”
Often, the men who contact us feel that they can’t talk to friends.
The old idea of "overcoming" is strong, as is the feeling that if it opens up to problems, it is seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term means of survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
While impartial, outspoken position on the other side of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're going to Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, and all the scenes are redesigned to celebrate, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a coffee?
Or, what’s even better, if you see someone on Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria to score and help PSG beat Malmö
Angel Di Maria with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavan will celebrate the paintings against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made his debut in the Champions League, helping PSG pass the Swedish team to Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is the hotel report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the Champions League debut in less than four minutes, pointing the way for the French champions, but the team missed a number of opportunities before finally adding to their lead by striking Cavan in the 61st minute.
Paris, who is in the same A-block with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as the game was not only a continuation, but also an improvement in their leading quarter-finals in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the points, it wasn’t a classic game, as Laurent Blanc’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasted his place in front of the goal and was later replaced by Malmö, his old home town team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy in the Champions League to win at home or at the guests, so a 2-0 win will bring problems to the opponent and look good in the statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things we'll have to do well this season," Blanc said.
This predicted good.
We wanted to win and we won, even though we weren’t able to make one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team after being injured in one of the three changes made after the team remained 2-2 in the Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux over the weekend, but he remained in the fourth minute in the shadow of Di Maria.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, an Argentine striker was named the man who would take PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran Marco Verrat's feed caught behind the Malmö defense line and then hit the beautiful finishing ground behind Johan Wiland.
However, if someone expected an easy and big win from PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a big opponent. It won Celtic in the finals in its release to this level, with nine international players in the opening field and a smart defense and two players in the deep middle field.
But the team offered almost nothing on the attacking side except the shot of Nikola Djurdjik in the 34th minute, which went past the button of the nipple from Kevin Trapp's paintball.
PSG, on the other hand, occasionally suffered from missed inputs and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in a total of five attempts in the first half only and was disappointed after Cavani put the ball in Ibrahimovic's contact with the second half.
However, he was much more effective in performing with his colleagues, and just after Ibrahimovic's input, Di Maria sent a roundtable, which cost Wiland around the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored an hour after the game, thanks to the Uruguayan Cavan hitting his sixth goal in the season after Ibrahimovic slipped forward from Maxwell's crossing left.
That ended Malmö's hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant fight from the direct firing of David Luiz kept the final numbers down before Ezequiel Lavezz's goal was rejected at the end of the game.
Mining coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were at a level as high as his team. The Norwegian said: "Finally our Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Cruelty is not enough.
I'm wearing a hat for Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore Gains <0x24>2.5 Billion in Shares Sales
The mining industry in Switzerland left Glencore, which suffered from commodity price spikes, on Wednesday to raise <0x24>2.5 billion in shares as part of its broad debt recovery plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares for about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to cut its debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is battling the prices of collapsed commodities as the slowdown in the Chinese economy burdens demand and causes destruction in all markets.
The new label raised the value of Glencore's stocks at the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday mornings.
Shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 penny in the FTSE 100 index, which increased by 0.69 per cent.
Glencore had unveiled last week as part of a <0x24>2.5 billion stock trade in its broader plan to cut its <0x24>30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold the new equity at 125 penny shares, which meant a 2.4% discount on Tuesday's final price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9.99% of the merger.
The long-standing steady growth of China has cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodities prices have fallen by 20-40%.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping is making a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in a statement released on Tuesday.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will be on September 25 and will be in response to President Barack Obama's last visit to Beijing in November, the statement said.
U.S. President Michelle Obama and his wife are organizing a dinner for Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will give an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on numerous global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to discuss constructively the issues in which there are differences," the statement said.
During the visit, which was first announced in February, Xin is expected to also depart in Seattle on his trip to Washington, meeting a number of U.S. technology leaders before heading for New York City and the September UN General Assembly.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and the country’s increased absolute waters of the disputed South China Sea.
Matt Damon Reduces Difference in Movies
Matt Damon joined African-American filmmaker Effie Brown in discussing their differences, which Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
In HBO’s Sunday evening episode Project Greenlight, an experienced actor interrupted Brown, highlighting the need for a variety of perspectives as to the dark main character of the script chosen for the project.
“When we talk about the difference, it’s taken into account when choosing actors for the movie, not for the series,” Damon said.
Annoyed Brown reacted to the injured disbelievingly, commenting "Oh! Wow. Okay", while The Martian actor's comments remained in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series' finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think about who the director is, no matter how they treat Harmony’s character,” Brown said.
The only dark figure is a whore who is beaten by her white pair.
The producer of The Dear White People demanded the rights to direct the film for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon answered quietly that their direction "may end up giving us something we don't want."
When the conversation was posted, social media exploded to its detriment Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPoon expressed his condolences to the film, writing: "Matt Damon talking to the only dark person in the room and explaining the difference to him is MY WHITE and hurting."
After its release, Twitter has collected more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments come at a time when the exact generic presentation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After a white police officer killed teen Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread across the country and called on lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminating against colorful people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the show as the Grammy Award-winning album of the Year.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and the lives of blacks, albums still matter.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently released a statement to answer Fox News TV's CEO Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question of whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the directors said.
Recently, it was reported that Damon was among the entertainers, producers and media monks who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the Pope.
The first American Ninja Warrior to be crowned
On Monday, professional athlete Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and receive a <0x24>1 million prize.
At the end of its seventh term, there has never been a competitor who would have survived all the parts of the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the final round.
In the last mission, a 23-metre rope had to be pierced in 30 seconds.
Britten jumped first and solved the challenge in time, making him the first athlete of all time to overcome the exhausting 4th installment of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero gave the interview to E!News after a hard win and was still shocked to win a <0x24>1 million main prize.
“So it’s great to think about this when I’ve never lived or lived as much as <0x24>10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his massive pay rise.
So all of a sudden... I can’t even imagine what the future will be like.
Production director Kent Weed sat down to discuss the final with The Hollywood Reporter and why Britten didn’t get more prize money, even though he’s the first competitor ever to get through the track.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“If more people pass, the money gets the one that has the fastest time,” Weed said.
While money is a great reward and life-changing, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels embarrassed about it.
He's just so happy that he's done what he's done.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a decent family.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, “If someone had to beat me, I’m happy that it was Isaac.”
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior is back for the eighth season, which will begin in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers hit the Minnesota Twins.
The second half of the season hasn’t been much fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but are now the last in the American League Central division.
The Tigers played the spoiler role perfectly on Tuesday when they won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
The Twins missed the opportunity to get to the top of the game in a Houston Astros race from another American League wild card spot.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter H-word pair for at least one night, which had been very difficult to achieve for most of the second half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter how they get,” Tigers team manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon continued his early attack support when Detroit ran three times in the first two rounds, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) entered 6 1/3 rounds and allowed three runs.
This was his third season in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end to this year," Simon said.
It's hard for the alternate to enter every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' substitute Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, which were his first hits in the race after mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hit night since he hit the Seattle Mariners for the fourth time on July 6.
"He's done a mile well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in kicking exercises), looked significantly better in kicking exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh round, and it was their best chance to get back into the game.
Sutter Byron Buxton started the round by hitting out twice on the left field line.
On the right side, Aaron Hicks came home with one laundry piercing, and Simon was burned directly by other laundry player Brian Dozier before Simon was replaced by left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Maueria, the only player against whom he faced, ahead of starter Miguel Sano, who would race two laps left from right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a leveling runner's second leg, VerHagen got three-legged Trevor Plouffen to hit a double-playing draw.
This was the main series record: for the 27th time this season, when Plouffe hit the doubles.
After Detroit had gotten a nine-time lead, Mauer would race two runs against Tigers closure Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
The right-hander, however, burned Sano in three innings in his fifth rescue.
In the beginning, Detroit took advantage of the roasting Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two rounds against a right-handed veteran player who ran out of the list of injured before the game after being out for more than a month due to an inflammation.
"Obviously, I didn't want to start like this," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I had a few nice inputs done in the third round."
After Hughes hit the first pitcher in the first pitch, he allowed second pitcher Ian Kinsler to move on from one to one.
On the right hand side, J.D. Martinez’s walk in two fires led to Victor Martinez’s scoring, who took himself to the first pitch and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 pipe while the runners were in good running positions.
Three-legged player Nick Castellanos went on to hit the right and cause another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected while trying to advance to the three-legged.
The Tigers continued in the second round and got one fire, in the case of two laundry, the kidnapper from James McCann and two fires, in the case of one laundry, the center of the run from Anthony Goss, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important hit," Twins team manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew in the right direction.
Hughes began to be in the input readings and entered the running third round, after which he was replaced by the right-handed sequel A.J. Achter.
Hughes scored three runs out of six strokes and a four-ball walk.
NOTE: Tigers right-handed feeder Anibal Sanchez was knocked out due to a stretching of his shoulder.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder blast, but he had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed feeder Daniel Norris comes out of the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norriksen's Tigers scored 1-1 in four starts after left-back David Price was replaced on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to the stretching of the right abdominal muscle.
The series of Tigers and Twins ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is set against Minnesota's right-handed forward Ervin Santanaa (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for a broader opening of the economy to the world
The economy needs to be expanded more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday, which is tasked with directing the reform.
"China should commit to attracting foreign finance and expertise and developing a policy of transparency," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Group leading to deepening the reform.
“Supporting transparency while moving forward with reforms will add new movement and vitality, as well as create new space for economic growth,” Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list to restrict market access, a relaxation of border control principles, a call for private capital for state-owned enterprises and a review of the population registration system.
According to the opinion, there is a negative list of sectors and companies that cannot be invested in.
The system is being gradually tested and improved with the help of experimental programmes.
The change is significant because it gives the market a greater role in allocation of resources, ensures a law-based business environment and makes the market more open.
The government will also loosen its control over the power it distributes to companies, thereby ensuring that the companies decide on their own how they operate their business.
The statement also said that China would allow border regions to explore new patterns of cross-border economic cooperation as well as new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up government-run sectors, more sectors will be opened to private donors.
“The government will not change its lineage with respect to foreign investments, and it will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services to them,” the statement said.
In addition, foreign permanent residence permits, "green cards", the application process is facilitated by optimizing the requirements and by simplifying the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of professional rights of lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, said in a statement published after the meeting.
