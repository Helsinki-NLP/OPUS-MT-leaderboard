Eighty-year-old chef found dead in shop in San Francisco
An eighty-year-old chef who recently emigrated to San Francisco was on the staircase of a local store this week.
But the victim's brother says he doesn't find anyone who wants to hurt him, and adds, "Finally, he's getting better."
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an eighty-year-old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galicia, the forensic doctor's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation was underway.
Victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was formerly a serial cook in Boston, got his dream chef job at Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said his death was “shut up and destroyed.”
“We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss a lot,” the spokesman said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had first slept in hostels, but that recently “he finally started to prosper.”
“He found an apartment, he went with a girl,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he doesn't think he's the one who wants to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any controversy.
He was a brother who took things as they are.
“Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an unbroken diamond that illuminated every day,” he said.

Czech routes have invested more than 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
They also have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, state-owned carriers have invested more than SEK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the shares of modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually decreasing.
Over the past six years, Czech trails have invested more than SEK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent showed a reduction in the average age of two years for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic wagons.
The largest share of the investment was given by the carrier in regional transport, where about 60 percent of the said money was directed, and 40 percent of the company invested in the restoration of vehicles for long-distance transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, modernized older vehicles are considered to be completely new in this indicator.
If the modernization of vehicles were not counted, the average driving age of vehicles in the Czech Republic would increase by ten years.
The average number of passenger cars is slightly older, with an average age of 23 years when modernization is taken into account.
If only the age from the date of manufacture was taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, in recent years the classic carriage kits made up of wagons and drawn by locomotive have gradually disappeared from the Czech and global railways and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive fell from 280 to 223 units, similarly the number of classic cars dropped from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in mid-year.
The carrier, in particular, got rid of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, the carrier allowed 110 of these cars to crash.
Of the investments that <0xC4><0x8C>D plans to make into the vehicle fleet in the near future, it is possible to say, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework for a single-trailer.
The contract includes up to 30 units of motors and 20 units of electrical units.
Authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We are completely powerless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year the online editorial of Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz is watching the story of a billboard in the south of the Czech Republic, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipn, where there is not only a touristic walk in the crowns of trees, but also an Olympic park.
Highway managers know they're standing there, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands of similar ads all over the country.
According to officials, there is a chatter law to blame, which makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
First of all, a complex bureaucratic wheel is needed.
In the meantime, however, the company will change its name and the office will be short on it.
Or just push the ad by a few meters and the official process has to start again.
The Directorate of Highways and Highways admitted a quarter of a year ago: at the main train from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovic to Lipno, the advertising billboard stands on our land near the state road.
But even three months were not enough for officials to get rid of unauthorized portable designs with a giant advertising poster.
It's like no one cares that he's standing right next to the road, in a 50-meter-long protective belt, where for safety reasons, nothing can happen.
Road managers claim that they can’t deal with billboards because of the punctuation of the law.
Maybe to load it and take it away.
"We must not just afford that," said Nina Ledvin, a spokeswoman for the Road and Highway Directorate, referring to a complex bureaucratic wheel that billboard removal must be prevented by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose destiny began online journal Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz to monitor in detail in the spring, however, is not unique and points to a general problem that cannot be solved effectively and quickly by the state and the authorities.
Only in the south of the Czech Republic, the editorial board counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to or near the road.
There are other regions in the same way.
“We have trouble for the companies to get the scammers removed,” confirms the head of the transport department of the Czechoslovak regional authority Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Klás, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to Klassy, there is a puzzling law that unites officials.
First of all, the billboard owner has to address difficultly to put the advertisement away.
But the chief companies are often inaccessible or they know the fint, which Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz already described in the past, when the issue began to be more interested in detail: it is enough for a mobile stand with an advertisement to move a few meters and officials can make a previous call to remove the black cottage.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, they see it as a new facility and we have to contact the owner again," explains Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Klása.
The new law will not help.
The change could be brought about by a new law, which will ban billboards from September next year on highways and limit them on I-class roads as well.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable advertisements will remain the same as before.
And the authorities are not so upset.
Firms can still make tens to hundreds of millions of SEK per year on renting illegal land, and no one can afford it.
For example, the billboard that attracts Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the Czech Buddhist Master currently conducts three administrative procedures for black-built billboards.
The company is facing a fine of 3,000 in each case.
These are more advertisements that were placed without permission in the I-class road safety zone.
The operation has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mraz, head of the transport department of the Czechoslovakia Magistrate.
Advertising that Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz is interested in, although among these cases it is not yet figured out, but will most likely come to them soon.
According to Nina Ledvin, spokeswoman for the SSR, the firm did not respond to repeated written calls for deletion, and the case will get to the table by county officials and then probably by the magistrates.
Commerz Billboard is one of the suspected companies that fails to contact.
She does not accept mail and the official seat in <0xC5><0xBD>i<0xC5><0xBE>kova was cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company’s mail was sent to Anton Fischer, a South-Czech businessman, who was famous for his sharp quarrel with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard company rents the spaces from Comerz Billboard and offers them to advertisers, has, however, refused any connection in the past.
In the spring, when the USSR began to be interested in advertising in Lipno, Fischer sent a letter to the mysterious Commerz Billboard company to his pension, where the new company is reportedly based.
However, no one has contacted the highway administrators to this day.
It's a waste of battle.
Similar silences or opaque seat changes are not uncommon.
A few years ago, one company was fined two million kroner.
But she changed her name and ICO and there was nothing to deal with.
The executor returned the case, the ads stood further, perhaps elsewhere.
We are quite powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It’s like fighting windmills, under the condition of maintaining anonymity one of the officials admits.
No one has yet resolved the bill in this regard.
Currently.cz has spoken to several MPs who have addressed the problem.
So far, there has been no activity.
On the contrary, there were MEPs who wanted to extend the deadline for the preservation of billboards in the main Czech communications.
The government has denied it.
Billboards are a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic not only for state-wide but also regional and municipal politics.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they themselves need them for ads in election campaigns.
I don’t give the relatively established impression that if something doesn’t work, then the laws need to be changed.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more cabbage and beans, statistics estimate.
According to the Czech Statistical Office, crop harvests will be 6.7% lower this year than last year.
However, this year’s harvest is above the average in the last five to ten years.
On the other hand, the harvest of cabbage (by 3.9 percent) and beans (2.5 percent) will be higher.
Cereal harvests will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is based on an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of July 15.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and predicted a decimal decline against last year.
Last year’s crop harvest, however, was over-average.
This year’s harvest exceeds the average in the last five to ten years.
In contrast, this year, the harvest of cabbage and mother will be higher.
Crop growers are harvesting 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they got 1.256 million tons under the roof.
This year’s mother’s yield could be 2.5 percent higher than last year’s.
The expected decline in cereal production is due to both a reduction of the hectare yield by 3.7 per cent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the crop area.
This year, the farmers were 3% less farmers.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be harvested by 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers moved her to more fields.
However, a lower hectare yield will be signed on the decline, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
Approximately a five-point drop in statistics is expected for spring barley, which is most often used for beer production.
Decreasing crop yields are worth a 15.2 per cent reduction in crop yields, but also a lower hectare yield.
On the contrary, winter’s yeast is 6.3 percent higher.
The harvest of cereals also grows.
Grape harvest statistics estimate 1,305 million tons, which is more than last year.
In fact, the surface area expanded by 7.3 percent.
The hectare yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s harvest of cabbage will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, while the occupancy is one-third larger than it was ten years ago.
In the last four years, the field with maca is also growing.
This year, farmers moved it to 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when the oak was grown in the Czech Republic on a record 70,000 hectares, the field is half.
Thanks to the expansion of the cutting areas, this year’s harvest will be richer.
Last year it rose by 2.5 percent to 27,423 tons.
The hectare yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police have accused two men of attacking him with a knife and a machete, the court sent him to prison.
Police have accused two attackers of attacking a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete on Tuesday in downtown Olomouc.
"Even though the attacker tried to escape, he was injured by urethra and cuts, which required hospital treatment and further treatment," police spokeswoman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trbáková said.
Both suspects were detained by police immediately after the attack.
The prosecutor filed the court’s motion for their arrest and the court granted him a hearing on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Police have accused two detainees of attacking a 35-year-old man in the center of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him cut and cut wounds, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that took place in the Freedom class on Tuesday afternoon, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in detention, Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trbáková said.
A mass clash between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive vocabulary strike, two attackers attacked with a knife and machete of a 35-year-old man.
Although the attacker tried to escape, he was injured by urethra and cuts, which required hospital treatment and further treatment, a police spokesman said.
The clash, which sparked a lot of attention in the city centre, and which forced several police guards and guards to intervene on the spot, was a family dispute.
Criminalists accused a forty-year-old man from Slovakia and a seventy-year-old man from Olomouc of attempting serious harm to health and resentment.
The prosecutor filed the court's motion for their arrest and the court met with him on Friday, a spokesman said.
The maceta was used in the center of Olomouc by the attackers five years ago, only a few dozen meters away, in front of the Varna disco in Riegrova Street.
Police said at the time that a group of about a dozen foreigners with guns attacked the company’s guests who were standing in front of the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, holes and machetes in their hands.
The court then sentenced two attacking foreigners to a conditional penalty.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You’ll be surprised if you walk around them every day.
One of the most exhilarating examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senova<0xC5><0xBE>ni Square.
It should have been a hotel for a long time.
But still nothing.
Is it necessary to build new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what to use the existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several action houses, which, despite their location, size and often even monumental protection, are empty and enjoy emptiness.
We selected properties in the center using the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the territory of the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of the financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies, or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more vacant homes in the Czech Republic than homeless.
Whether the owners pay a special tax on them, they want an initiative

Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made <0x24>10.6 million last year.
More than <0x24>1 million was donated to Clinton for charity.
The majority of Clinton’s revenue – over <0x24>6 million – is in favor of their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Friday released her tax returns, raising pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made <0x24>10.6 million last year, AP said.
The majority of Clinton's revenue - over <0x24>6 million - is in favor of their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton started her campaign ahead of the election.
The tax report showed that Clinton’s husbands levied a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, followed by a state and local income tax of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of the income tax.
But Trump has a problem with a similar move, so far he has not decided to publish a tax confession.
There is a certain possibility that Donald Trump will not pay any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after her confession was published.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to secrecy around Trump’s revenues, among other things, to raise doubts as to whether her rival is really as wealthy as she claims.
Trump’s assets are estimated at billions of dollars.

In Nigeria, the riot has again erupted.
Islamists from Boko Haram defended consistent vaccination and killed doctors.
In Nigeria, cases of childbirth have reappeared.
In the northeast of the country, the government has declared an emergency vaccination, as two children infected with the disease have contracted.
Vaccines were transported by helicopters.
In the affected area there were Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram, who prevented vaccination and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated unobservedly.
In northeastern Nigeria, the emergency vaccination of children against obesity is underway because two children have been infected with the disease.
In Africa, the disease was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that a million children will be vaccinated in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday quickly shipped children's vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram are active.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating in the area for many years.
In the past, Boko Haram extremists have defended vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks on Thursday also made it impossible for doctors to reach areas where children with tuberculosis were detected.
Both affected children came with refugees from Nigeria who had recently been released from Boko Haram.
The head of the WHO section responsible for the eradication of the obstetrics, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria will begin next week.
In Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram was active for a long time.
The area was made available to international organizations and governments until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram was able to weaken substantially in this part of the country.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole has admitted that the new cases are a big disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that it had been wiped out.
The WHO has warned that it is possible that although the disease has not occurred for two years, it has spread among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.

The Pope met with ex-prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the story of the fallen women.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes who, thanks to police, escaped from a gang of prostitutes.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look confidently into the future.
At this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to trafficking in human beings and call for a stronger fight against them.
Pope Francis met in Rome with 20 former prostitutes who were released by police from the power of a gang of prostitutes.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the story of the fallen women for more than an hour and then urged them to look confidently into the future, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes that Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30 years old.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were subjected during forced prostitution to cruel physical violence.
During his visit, Francis wanted to draw attention to trafficking in human beings and call for a stronger fight against him, the Pope’s spokesman said.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek often points out the destinies of people on the edge of society.
On Thursday, for example, he lunched with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this year in April and in June thanks to his personal invitation.
France is attacking the jihadist factories.
Without the help of Muslims, it will not work.
In the fight against radical Islamism, France is helping the Muslims themselves.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Vallse is planning to make major changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of spiritual people.
Since December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer halls.
And others will follow, the Interior Minister said.
There are over 100 productions of jihadists in the country.
“If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this freedom of expression,” said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayers.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from foreigners for the construction of new mosques, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Persian Gulf countries.
Even for this reason, preachers who can spread radicalism in France get into the mosques.
“Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy,” he added.
The key to ensuring the achievement of these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should serve as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from a foreigner.
The French Foundation for Islam is now active in the country, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
By that time, the Foundation had contributed to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that financed their construction.
But the institutions soon sparked internal contradictions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," said Valls recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate over a new institution that would replace the non-functional foundation was debated.
They all accelerated further terrorist attacks in France, carried out by radicalized Islamists on behalf of the Islamic State.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has recently announced that a new foundation will be created in October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic resources and also to supervise imams.
It is not yet clear where he will take money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also various educational centers.
However, a number of proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or halal food tax.
Here, in practice, halal food vendors would pay for providing certification.
Some of that money would then go to the foundation’s cash register.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 kroner) could then be paid by French pilgrims who travel to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them go on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the prime minister, only publishers who have undergone special education programmes at French universities should be involved in mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching is in line with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is fighting against the radicals.
And others will follow, the Interior Minister recently announced.
There is no place in France for those who report hate in mosques and do not respect certain principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are an estimated 2,500 mosques and prayers in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, authorities have expelled about 80 imams and several other dozens are considering this.
However, not everyone thinks that the government’s actions can have a significant impact on radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the internet, said Severine Labat, an expert from the National Center for Scientific Research.
Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint with the star Baugem.
The Czech racing cyclist has to fight in repair rides for the procedure to the eighth round.
Drum cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro after a sprint qualifying procedure among the top eighteen, lost in the first round to French giant Gregory Baughém, the silver defender of the previous games in London.
The procedure to the octave must be fought in repair rides.
At the start of the royal discipline on the track, 27 riders stood up and the best Czech runner at the moment ascribed the fourteenth best time.
The doubles with a light start reached in 9,969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, he was expected to qualify for the fifth Baugé, who already has bronze from Ria in the team sprint.
Even though Kelemen finally reached the point of an experienced Frenchman, he took note of the process.
It was a great performance by Jason Kenny, a goldsmith.
Eighty-year-old Brit scored the third fastest doubles in history and qualified in an Olympic record of 9,551.
Easily then, as expected, he also managed to deal with the last one, which was the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet was also made up of Bradley Wiggins, who set a new world record of 3:50,570 in a four-kilometre race and went to the final.
So far (3:51,659), which the British had four years since the Olympics in London, improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Press: They Want a Fresh Wind in the Industry
Representatives of young doctors have come together to approve new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must seek full advice to support further sectoral events from the beginning of September.
The JDC says the ministers failed to resolve the issues concerning the treaty.
Young doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with BMA.
58% of the voters who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC president Ellen McCourt said the government remained "still silent" on questions, which led to the rejection of the contract.
“In this light, the executive authority of the JDC by voting decided to completely reject the proposed new treaty and call for new formal negotiations on all issues,” she said.
In response to the government’s silence today, the JDC Executive Board formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve the current programme of threatened sectoral events from the beginning of September.
The dispute led young doctors this year to announce six strikes, including the first general strikes in NHS history.
The leader of young doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
Members of the BMA at meetings before voting before 54,000 young doctors and medical students said the deal was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the health minister said the deal would be a burden for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance ‘incompatible’?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce the formal end of the eight-month-long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the exuberant hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
It was hand-in-hand, yes.
But Putin was not smiling and hardly emitted heat from him, even according to his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his "dear friend" to Mr Putin five times, according to one report.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its pre-crisis level, but would be even better.
The next day, a local newspaper wrote that Erdogan was acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persisting cold that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory speech: the shooting down of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey at the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was outrageous.
Putin spread the wounds around him and accused Ankara of killing Moscow with a knife in the back.
The embarrassment was even greater that it came from a suspected friend.
Re-establishing real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
For months, state-controlled media led a massive general campaign against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it looked like the Turks could have done everything.
More serious was the accusation from top state officials that Erdogan’s own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only because Putin received an apology he had asked of President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared such a victory.
The benefits of the declaration of a ceasefire are clear to Ankara.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost deprived of power during the failed coup last month and therefore needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly shocked them.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia’s sanctions have had a severe impact – especially the cancellation of charter flights, which transport several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
This number decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies here are sure to take a breath when there is a renewal of flights.
They are earning on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television has promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey will be allowed again.
“Turists there, tomatoes back here,” the report said in Vedemosti newspaper.
The visit, however, had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a bad reaction to a coup attempt.
In addition, the long-lasting innocence of prolonged talks on EU accession and Putin's accession - which is eager to use the cooling to break Turkey's grip on the West.
The Russian leader certainly gained bonus points when Ankara asked him for the help of the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which is deeply rooted in the fear of regime change, it is given.
So the summit in this pompous, offshore palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to show what one of the analysts described to me as an "incompatible alliance": how the forces of the two countries, which feel to be rejected and exploited by the West, unite.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly demonstrated mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently took on the role of peacekeepers, but where Russia and Turkey stand on the opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of opening talks, both presidents said at a press conference that they did not even mention this issue.
The Turkish president deliberately went out of his way to answer a question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both countries can find a common talk on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility – and given the risk of a complete disaster when a member of NATO Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet – it is certainly better that the two leaders at least speak together again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand is to be reprinted into the role back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
She struggled with them when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategic brands used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
Millions of pounds were spent on sponsoring international sports, from the Six Nations rugby championship to Winbledom champion Andy Marraye.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more to stand out rather than national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not launch new trades.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of central and stock coding, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is already used.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that get more at the forefront - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our journey to Inverness-shire customers and staff, McEwan answered Ross McEwan’s questions.
RBS will cease to be the investor brand and the brand our employees are working for, because we are now becoming a lot more a brand bank.”
As the bank itself became a global brand, it also became a global brand of RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have aspirations focused on the home scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations championship, it has prepared a profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
“The time has come for us to move to the brand bank because the fundamental question (which we are asking) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers,” said the CEO.
“Three years ago, it would be very cynical to say that we are going to be a great bank for our customers and that brands are going to be introduced.
But along with how we focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think there are a lot of changes going on.
We can remind these brands again, I think the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori at the Newmarket on horseback Predilection led to goal 3000. winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win at Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins
Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th win in Britain at Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone was achieved by his second victory of the evening on his local route - on a Predilection horse coached by John Gosden.
Fifty-five-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in level achievements.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time jack of Dettori, who had previously won the Ghayyar horse, said, "It's special."
I'm very lazy because my family is here too.
I’m very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because that’s where I anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on land with 20,000 people.
I enjoyed it and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when Predilection brings after victory
Two jockeys have achieved this milestone in obstacle achievements – jockey champion Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who during his career has scored more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical fistron that distinguishes him from other riders seriously.
He’s a fantastic ambassador of achievements, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn’t drive only on weekends and big breaks, he’d already have 6,000 winners!
However, the truth is that Frankie drove the winners in the UK after most of his 30-year career, and that’s really something.
It has a lively character, which is good for British sports, but more importantly, it's an incredible joke.
Frankie Dettori Celebrated His Success With His Famous Summer Jump
From the summer finishes to the summer jumps, Frankie Dettori has been the ambassador of the British Equal Achievements for two decades.
It was like riding a mountain trail.
An insurmountable number of winners of major races, including his famous "big Seven" in Ascot, survived the plane crash and was banned from taking off due to drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a six-month ban on the start, but showed unbelievable inner strength and returned to all doubters despite being in the best shape.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin Launches Presidential Officer Sergei Ivanov
On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office.
Ivanov was one of Putin’s closest collaborators for many years.
Thirty-three-year-old Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Putin had "liberated Ivanov from his office as head of the Russian presidential office," but no reason was given.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Evno was formerly a diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he was promoted to the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) says that he later worked as the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When appointing Putin, he said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the Head of State within the meaning of the bill and to check to what extent your instructions are being followed.
Putin said on Friday that Ivanov had asked her to be released from office and recommended that he be replaced by Evno.
Convincing smiles?
This move completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin’s closest associates for a long time and worked for the KGB as well as Putin.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on state television, the two men declared that he was leaving the post of president’s office at his own request.
But the smiles in the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a struggle for power?
No one knows that yet.
But the official claim that the man he once thought of as a possible president, all of a sudden wants to lead Russia’s ecological policy, was met with great distrust.
The Kremlin’s website quotes Putin’s remarks, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012, in an interview, I asked you to give me this very demanding post, even if you could call it a problematic post, he entrusted for four years.
Apparently, I was the head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
He previously held the post of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
At the time, it was even speculated that Ivanov could become Putin’s successor to the state after his second term because the third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
This post, however, was taken over by another close Putin collaborator Dmitry Medvedev.
Just three and a half years later, before returning to the presidency, Putin became prime minister.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the crime scene, was released after he shot the director.
Gibson was involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene in Los Angeles last month.
The television stations ABC and CBS that produce the series announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Aaron Hotchner's special agent, apologized on Thursday before announcing his eviction.
There have been creative differences on the stage and disagreements.
I'm sorry that happened," he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS television stations, details of how Gibson's character disappears from the series, which follows the stories of the FBI's team of agents, are a bit later.
The 40-year-old actress, whom she celebrated for her lead role in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, starred in the series from the first series in 2005.
“I love the thoughts of criminals and over the past 12 years I have put my heart and soul into them,” Gibson said in a statement.
I hoped I'd be in it till the end, but it's not possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team, and above all to the great fans that this show could ever have hoped for.
The return of the series to the twelfth series is expected on September 28.
In Banff mysteriously landed fish in the garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish could be sand storks that left the water sludge there.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a short film on the Periscope channel of his findings in the belief that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Now connects with Fife
<0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct – the bridge now connects with Fife.
This is the first of the four closures between the “platform riders”, which are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we are all witnessing how construction engineers, on an impressive scale, used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required exceptional precision.
Over 79 percent of the total area of the bridge is now in place, the concrete for the last part of the platform is now melted in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be raised to the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure in building each bridge is always an important milestone.
In this amazing project, this conclusion represents the tip of the ground construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the expanding North Tower platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approximation viaduct 700 millimetres southward.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and it had to be pulled with a climb of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances he worked with the team were very small - only a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy to be alive”
Three men are "happy to be alive" after the water was rinsed from their fishing boat near Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station issued an alarm on Friday at 13:20 British Summer Time after the crew saw the incident in the Bay of Moelfre.
All three men attempted to swim to safety, while their boat continued uncontrollably.
“We saw their boat roar in their vicinity and thought of the worst,” said Moelfre Vince Jones, the lifeboat’s steering officer.
“Luckily, the strong wind drove her away from them before we left,” he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, the third man, aged 60, was found without a rescue vest exhausted as the fights were held.
All were transferred to the coastal lifeboat and transferred back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely uninjured.
The engine had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who steered the boat when it was reversed.
Someone was holding a protective hand over the boys.
The judge refuses to settle the case for Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>’s wife.
Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> is one of three MEPs who allegedly were to receive political traffic from Prime Minister Neczae and his then-leader Jane Nagy’s office, a lucrative post for a political concession.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Snyder, Fuchs and Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> enabled him with their resignations.
Then they appeared on influential positions in state-owned companies.
So they also faced suspicions of retaliation and ended up in detention for a month.
However, according to the court, it was unjustified, and there was a total of almost 2 million crowns in compensation.
He is now acting as a witness in the case, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a courthouse at the Fruit Market and solves civil disputes.
However, Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious (resolving criminal cases - cf. red.) and to prevent possible objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another district court in Prague.
The Queen has already released Jan Neczanov, formerly Nagy, twice.
It was an alleged abuse of military intelligence to track Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>a Radka's first wife.
In this case, Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> did not figure out.
According to Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary overreaction.
I do not think that impartiality can be interpreted in such a way as to exclude the court if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid nothing could be judged at all, he noted for the newspaper.
"I think it's awkward," he added.
In the case of political traffic is also charged Roman Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ek, a former official.
However, according to his lawyer Petr Toman, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
On June 13, the District Court for Prague 1 discussed the indictment of former Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>ae Jana Nagyová (today Nezhová) and other accused in the case of abuse of the Military Intelligence.
In the photo, Nezmo<0xC5><0xA1>ová and her husband come to court.
Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>ová was supposed to handle the statements about Peroutka.
For example, the wife of the ambassador was to sue President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman’s statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutko.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolchildren is dead!
The girl must have been killed in an allied airstrike.
Along with her two equally old girlfriends, she flew to Syria last February from London’s Gatwick Airport.
The British interior ministry did not comment on her death.
The young Londoners who fled their homes were said to have been secretly transported to Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana are reported to be targeting their other former colleague from the Bethnal Green Academy in London.
Last year, the case sparked a huge wave of attention, as well as tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security officials estimate that some 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria so far, including some 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined the radicals from ISIS and other groups.
Those who return home are a terrorist threat to the United Kingdom.
Work of dreams for a hundred thousand dollars.
It’s a great job that you don’t even need to go to college.
This is what the artist looks like at first glance.
And often the other one.
In fact, the advantage is not only an extremely high salary for Czech conditions (in Prague you can earn up to 180 000 CZK by working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
It is estimated that there are almost 20,000 IT specialists missing in the Czech Republic.
The most sought after are, according to Grafton staff statistics, programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose from a number of job offers.
The candidates are therefore not challenged by the job, but by the job position of the candidates, comments Jitka Sou<0xC4><0x8D>ková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a necessity for students.
Higher education means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the candidate’s intelligence and educational ability, but often has little in common with the knowledge of development.
Developers need to constantly learn new things, which once graduated college will not replace, says Petr Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka, director of Monster Career CZ.
Most of it is made in Prague.
The salaries of the artists everywhere are higher than the Republican average.
They will get the most money in Prague and Brno, it is no longer such a hitparade in the regions.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka confirms.
The highest earnings will be achieved by technical directors.
In Prague and Brno they can reach 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it does not fall below 80,000 CZK.
IT project managers are also in demand.
At the start they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
It's also about graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the workplace, this does not apply to teenagers.
If companies retreat and overpay a specialist from another company, they like to save the graduate.
They can educate him according to their own.
They can't do without language.
The knowledge of a foreign language is suitable in every profession, but a minimum of decent English is required for the students.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity in some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a number of cases where companies are looking for a particularly professionally trained and experienced person and are satisfied only with the average proficiency of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker controls more than one foreign language, it is interesting for his employer, as it can serve more customers from different countries, says the director of Cuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
Good on Google, there's paradise.
It is only quiet that Czech workers can be jealous of Google’s employees.
Of course, there are flexible working hours for them, the possibility of working from home or various shortened loans, not just for moms.
“The company provides newly baked dads with an additional four weeks of leave after the birth of the baby,” says Martina Jonekova, a Google spokeswoman.
It also includes health care for employees and family, food, transportation, training, wellness or massages directly in the workplace.
Anyone who wants to learn has green, and it doesn’t matter what new they want to learn.
But the advantages don't end there.
Such a free full refrigerator is definitely not for sale either.
Healthy lunch (in some places as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microwaves in all offices, where people always find healthy snacks, a spokesman said.
And in order for nothing to be thrown away, so what you don't sleep, put it in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these on the Czech relations incredible advantages?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
“For Google, it’s not important for employees to sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, moves or developments, ideas and innovative solutions,” the spokesperson added.
The U.N. strongly criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, on Thursday accused Bulgaria of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "causes serious concern that Bulgaria does not comply with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
"It is particularly troubling to be a witness to how important and influential public figures publicly express support for the criminal armed struggles that are arranging the hunt for refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey," he said.
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who go into Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested," Zeid said.
And worse, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned for a year or more if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that under international law everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year and 21,000 during the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - the hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It is fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many people have complained that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time over screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people from the sofas and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens was originally spent on television, later on video games, and most recently on smartphones.
It is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I’m talking about fashion, which is Pokémon Go, a character-based app that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards, and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there has been a decline in interest in the United States, Australia and New Zealand before the launch of the new game in early July.
The listing in other countries was then postponed due to a huge interest that led to overloading the servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users in a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, smartphone players go out to search for Pokémon that track them using GPS, and when they find them, they can “photo” them (via screenshots on the phone) or “catch”.
Mania was thrilled by a generation who played the game at a young age, raising her from the seats and looking for women out for Pokémon.
In the United States, thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that the “average” person will take every day.
The Cardiogram smartwatch app from Apple, which tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people watched for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who is playing Pokémon Go - they only see rough exercise level data.
Many public campaigns trying to get people to “find 30,” “get up from the couch” and “be active every day” fell to infertile ground because most public health messages are boring and intended for people who don’t look good.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can’t give in full here.
But the beauty of the game Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something that is fun.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sun rays. And fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting for pokemons.
As is the case, of course, there are also these boring patrons who are looking for any pretensions to complain.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
What, like?
It's a breakthrough.
At the time, smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity, but they didn’t give us any reason to do something like this game.
The story begins to fade, and interest in it begins to fade at some point.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémon, more games will emerge, which will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity and help many people in their pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's multi-color gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic jumping.
No effort on the hammer.
When they were free, they all got it.
Excellent in everything.
And now, at last, an Olympic champion.
A nineteen-year-old American gymnast headed straight for a multi-color title on Thursday, overcoming the rest on the full line under the Olympic headlights.
A total score of 62,198 was clearly confirmed by her jump in front of silver medalist and team member Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a betting performance in the final of the multiplayer individuals in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win multiple games, and the fifth overall when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps even the best of all.
When her overall final score was on the table and her long journey to this point was over, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks her in the same league of single athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, won 15 medals at the world championships - including 10 gold. Her stunning sets are blending ambition and precision, and Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton has named her the “best gymnast.”
The last test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the races, but between her own and the burden of too big expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be perceived as disappointing.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman are hugging after winning the gold and silver medals in the women's multiplayer final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
The first Biles won on Tuesday, when she was as a screamer in the celebration of the leaving national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that during her long journey to the summit she never looked forward, which is not so completely true.
Part of her set in the plain - the one that contains her typical triple jump with a double turn - is embedded in Latin music that would just fit home, into the streets outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a child and her talent was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and where he gained strength.
The multiplayer competition hasn’t lost since the summer of 2013 – it’s a series of victories that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafin took the lead for a short time thanks to two turns, it was just an illusion.
The bet and the simple - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back to the front with 15,433 points for the hammer - and finished with 15,933 points in free.
Raisman gently hugged her as she waited for the final score – just formality – and around the glowing red, white and blue shadows, tears appeared to Biles when the wish she had once written in the diary was fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payoff for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared a third lap with Mustafin, but at the time it was bronze due to the sum of the three best teams.
This time, the twenty-two-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "Grandma", was far ahead.
After her simple, she sent the crowd aerial kisses, resisted by a return, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where it became a total hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in case of serial killer shot while listening to music in car
According to a police report released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and daughter Ellis Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road.
According to the report, the armed man was standing on the side of the passenger and fired eight wounds from his handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, it is not worth the triple murder robbery because the attacker did not take the wallet, nor the amount of <0x24>2,900 that one of the adult victims had with him.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had anything to do with any of the previous four attacks.
In two largely Hispanic neighborhoods, a total of nine attacks took place in four months, killing seven people and injuring two others.
“It’s happening in the villa neighborhood in front of the house,” Howard said earlier this month for CBS’ KPHO branch.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital where she later suffered injuries.
Liner (31) and daughter Ellis Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which became the target of an empty van just half an hour before a triple murder. The police believe that it was the cause of this serial killer.
Investigators found the cartridges and assembled a bullet from the rest of the balls in the seat and from under the engine cap.
The mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: “His condition is improving”
Edmund Picciuto, like most children of his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, the first time I thought I couldn't handle this.
I can't handle this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not at all true - of course you are ready for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund might never know her and that she might not survive.
Some doctors even suggested that it be placed in the institute.
“My first reaction was that I thought people weren’t doing this anymore,” Picciut explains.
Edmund walks with the help of a pedestrian.
He couldn't sit or bend until he was three years old, and he still doesn't speak.
Some of the borders are already slowly being filled.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth performs a sign speech, using which Edmund says "please sing to me".
“We teach him sign language,” Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not a common character speech - he says that Edmund invented some characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, such as the case of Edmund, and after pregnancy infections caused by viruses, such as sleeping pills or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It's too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of the infected.
Picciutto is reminiscent of the emotional tax he chooses for the uncertain future.
I constantly ask, “What will happen next?”
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked myself what the overall prognosis is, because I don’t expect anyone to be able to tell me at all.
But Picciutto has an encouraging message for the mothers of all children who suffer from congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is getting better.
You know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods demanded rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and extensive flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with further rains expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) has reported that after extreme meltdowns, several rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi flow from their shores and are in danger of massive flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said they are receiving applications for vehicles to ride in water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only a district of Tangipahoa asked for 10,000 bags of sand.
Flood guards will remain in most southern Louisiana to work until Saturday.
The Meteorological Service said in a statement that it could spread an additional 8 to 13 centimeters above sea level.
In southern Alabama, a flood guard was on alert on Friday as rains continued in the city's Mobile area.
The Comite River at Baton Rouge and the Amite River at Denham Springs are expected to peak this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said the two said they could flood a number of homes in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that floods in the Ascension district are at risk, when these dispersed streams will flow only slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, a little south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level on Friday at 9 a.m. local time.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the incoming waters of Amite and Wilkinson County in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among those rescued by Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said that he was warned by his other unowned son, who lives nearby.
“We woke up and the water was approaching,” Hansford said.
We had it in our passport.
According to his wife, it is the highest level she has ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all of his family members are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers had rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they remained hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that as heavy rains continue, the floods “speak rapidly” and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that from midnight to Friday morning rainfall fell by 35 centimeters.
Krautmann said the ground has been very wet since mid-summer.
Authorities said heavy rains and paid roads demanded the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of education in five school districts.
The WWL branch of CBS reported that 200 homes had been flooded, according to the Tangipahoo elder.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets, which were trapped by high water.
In the village of Amite and in the city of Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
“They’ll be able to go home when the water starts to sink,” he said.
In the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to flooding, and locals were given sandbags that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
“The last big floods we had here in March,” said Lacy Landrum, the city’s manager.
Looks like these floods are going to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, manager for emergency situations in Harrison County, Mississippi, said the Persian Gulf coast continues to rain.
He said a couple of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
“I saw water in a few places where I had never seen it before,” said Townson, “and it’s still there.”
Mahaj Brown, 6, “a boy shot like a dead man” survives shooting in Philadelphia
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a six-year-old in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child identified her for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaje Brown.
The grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including legs, legs, arms, and belly, but was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
“He caught it too much, his little body was shot like it was,” his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that the boy should be healed.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men at the age of 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, two more victims are in a stabilized state.
According to the station, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a ninety-nine-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be a shooter.
Investigators at the CBS Philadelphia station said there was likely to have been a shooting between several armed men.
On the site were found cartridges of attack weapons of the type, belonging to various attack weapons.
It was, of course, a continuous battle.
There were cartridges on both sides of the street.
So it seems there were several armed fighters here who were actively involved," Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No one has been arrested and police are allegedly investigating video footage from cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a bullet in front of a house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s how I imagine the women’s gymnast team for this year’s Olympics, for a number of reasons.
First, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also confirmed the presence of blacks and Latin Americans at the top of the sport.
The number one gymnast in the last four years has been an African-American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second floor last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisedly became the champion of the Olympics and America jazz.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible performance of the three-time world winners Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who presented unexpected but masterful gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to earn gold in a female multi-coloured individual.
And Aly Raisman, a member of the team, got the silver.
We are witnessing a sporting summit, but in gymnastics classes in the country it doesn’t look like that.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie were on the same journey as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the gymnast will be made up of only four athletes for the next Olympics, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is training.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnastics train mainly in private gymnastics clubs, which maintain parents who pay the costs of training, equipment, travel, dresses, competition fees, hotel accommodations and all (for their trips).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs gymnasts have all the training and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they began gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to the countless communities of young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie have inspired.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (especially of Black and Hispanic origin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and the hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team to send us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics. And that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for proving the "girls' strength" and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to embark on a journey with young, healthy and strong young people.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter further strikes
The ministers hoped that after the newly revised agreement, the British Medical Association (BMA) will end disagreements over the changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the election rejected the agreement.
Hunt revealed in July plans to enforce the contract with the NHS being in “land of nobody” and further delays would have a detrimental impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend work practices to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, president of the BMA Young Doctors Commission, said in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that the current labor crisis will increase.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors enter into a new contract, it is necessary to make progress and time passes.
The BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have met with the reluctance to engage Dr. and often with deceptive silence on the part of the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
“Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for coercion, and solve the concerns of young doctors.”
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike in late April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, as nurses and specialists were called to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised agreement, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would conclude disagreements regarding the changes.
BMA wants higher pay for work over the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the president of NHS employers, urged young doctors not to enter any strike.
Mortimer said: “A little or nothing can be achieved by military action, but there will be pressure on already overloaded teams and services and an increase in concerns, exhaustion and disruption for patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have been discussing with the council of young doctors, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of supervisor and informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, further training for those who return after a career break, cost of training, health care care care, mutual recognition of subjects - education, health care, health care, education, leisure, and education in England
A cure for 60 crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take the drug, which costs about sixty crowns (two pounds). Authorities recommend to give it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a seizure in people with heart disease.
The drug is now administered after a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of a stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another stroke or heart attack.
Infarction and cardiac arrest are caused by the accumulation of fat, which creates a related layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is ripped off, blood clots can occur, blocking the access of blood to the heart, and the occurrence of a heart attack.
If the cholesterol is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, block the blood supply to the brain, and cause brain death.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of collisions by being less likely to occur.
The NICE proposal, which was published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, twice a day for a further three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there is a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will have another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on the patient’s quality of life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and deaths in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand the treatment options that are available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially on the risk of bleeding - is limited over three years, the proposed treatment is not recommended for this period.
Computer culture has begun to flourish in the Muslim regions.
The mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year because of corruption, which was linked to a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the ignoring of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, a government report said today.
Former Prime Minister Sir Eric Pickles sharply criticizes the police, election inspectors and councillors for ignoring voter abuse for “sensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former community secretary, now the leader of anti-corruption interventions, said that intimidating voters based on their religion is so bad that the police should make cordons in front of the polling stations and protect scared voters.
He recommended that voters take their identity card with them and be able to prove who they are in the election.
Currently, voters just need to enter their name and address.
The report also suggests that an indelible ink should be applied to the fingers of the person who votes in order to avoid having to vote twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It calls for the press to have greater access to documents from the meeting and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"It's not just about protecting against election fraud, it's also protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand," he said.
The report was demanded by Downing Street as a result of the election scandal at Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the acting mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his post on charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had “cynically affected” the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, in his words, “led his campaign so that it was a religious duty of devoted Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were questioned, or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and turns himself over to someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern about fraud in the correspondence vote — which is said to have been triggered by senior members of the Muslim community during the vote by people who voted for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including presenting an identity document
The report said: "Evidence has been provided that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been put under pressure to vote at the will of the elderly, especially in communities of Pakistan and Pakistan."
“There were concerns that ... the state institutions had turned their eyes on such behavior because of their ‘politically correct’ hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating correspondence votes and thus preventing “voting out.”
The report, which is now being evaluated by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and dose fraud.
Consider asking voters to submit their identity document before voting.
Use an indelible ink on people’s fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Implementing systematic nationality checks to ensure that people can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to three years.
To prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating submitted correspondence votes and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create around the polling stations a cordon.
Amend laws to make it easier to prosecute those who develop illegal pressure under the Reform Act of 1983.
Prohibit photography in the polling stations.
Requiring that only the English (except Wales) work in the polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers adhere to the rule that voters go to polling stations individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says it’s “surprising” that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The Elections Court ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubts - in the power of evidence of a crime.
He also criticizes the inconsequential "check of check boxes" in the departments for voter registration in the City Hall.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court decision in the Tower Hamlets case by waking up.
Our nation has a proud legacy of parliamentary democracy, but the worrying and hidden spread of election fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threaten this reputation.
Insane cyclist duchess Kate and other duels of famous figures at the Olympics in Rio
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went crazy about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is remarkably similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the twenty-four-year-old Olympic athlete is by no means the only athlete looking for gold this year that can boast of her own duo from a number of well-known figures - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous characters that are currently appearing on our screens, the women's column FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a Hunted Beast: Member of the Brady Ellison (left) American Arc-en-circuit team has been compared to Leonard DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate’s twin on the cycling trail, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonard DiCaprio.
American sniper racer Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures appeared on which he resembled a wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he had heard about his similarity to Lee since he was a little girl.
“I don’t see much resemblance, except for the beards,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
“It’s a guy and he looks good, so I think it’s a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will undoubtedly highlight this year even more: the striking image between the British long-distance jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafin, with her big, pronounced eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the series star Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for the change: User thinks Nathan is the "athletic version" of the actor from the movie Inception
Another long-standing comparison is comparing tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly dense eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efim is proud not only of the same brown skin and blond hair as Annalyn McCord has. And about Nathan Adrian from the US team fans say it looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Awesome women: the football news of Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not only one: Twitter user was very happy that the similarities were noticed by others
On the waves theory: According to this user there may be a reason for the similar appearance of pairs
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the site that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
The soccer star Hope Solo and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter really have an incredibly similar shape of face and eyes.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the holder of the gold medal for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who boasts of her beautifully wide-ranging Union girdle, Gabriel would be smiling like a cocoon.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying she had "exploded" about a Chinese swimmer
The viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast from the Olympics on CBC dismayed the performance of fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan by commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place of the women's race at 4x200 m freestyle staff
Canadian CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “took up like a smell” and “exploded” during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald believed that his microphone was turned off when at the end of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle staff finale he began to whisper his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring “revival” to CBC’s team of commentators, said, among other things, “That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool.”
Too much excitement, it slipped like a smell, it exploded.
Oh, thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, floated second in the race at 1:57.79 – 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to reach China.
Audiences in Canada began to make a quick call online and were frightened by the tone and language the commentator used.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “The CBC spokesman declared that a fourteen-year-old swimmer from China ‘exploded’?????
The idiot didn't notice he's still on the radio."
Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's 4x200 m freestyle racing race was described as, "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you asshole."
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many demanded his resignation
When Twitter users found out how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn’t hold back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a gang of racists.
Shortly after, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who escaped the broadcast."
It was an unhappy choice of words, we're sorry that it happened."
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to a comment
Scott Russell must have apologized on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and pasted their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about comments by MacDonald.
The station also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
She sincerely regrets that those words were uttered, she should not get into ether.
We quickly apologized to our broadcasters and to those who were following us on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron’s comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unhappy choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to explain his remark by claiming that he did not want it to appear as a personal attack.
"I'd like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's team," he said in a CBC broadcast from the Olympics.
“I meant the performance of a swimmer, not the person of a swimmer as such.”
“It’s not necessary to say that I didn’t mean any disrespect and I’m very sorry.”
Customers in Primark humiliated by a woman who tried underwear in the middle of a shop
When a woman came out to try her pants in the middle of the Primark shopping area, they were not sure which direction to look at.
To make it even worse, she tried to drop her size, put on her pants and put them back on the shelf.
She continued the tour and finally tried four pairs of pants at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Flokestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried her pants before returning to the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that the mysterious woman, after testing underwear, “re-dressed and left the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the shop, took her pants from the shelf, took off her own stockings and pants and put them on.
“She didn’t even try to find a discreet place—she just stood there, shuddering like a monkey.”
“Everyone was just looking at her pants again, and obviously she didn’t like them because she had them back in the rack.”
She did the same thing with three others before she finally decided she didn’t like anything, dressed up again and left.
“She didn’t seem to care at all about who was looking – not even thinking about the man who might be buying the pants she’d tried.”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "The idea that someone would take home the pants that someone else had on and no one cleaned them. That's ugly."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "When she left, I picked up the things I obviously tried to pull them off the sale - which is also the only thing that's right."
“I’d be shocked to think that I’d bring my new pants home and find out that another woman was wearing them, dressed them, and that they weren’t washed.”
Primark spokesman said: “Primark knows about the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.
All the products concerned have been withdrawn from the sale.
How to Defend Against Weapons Attack with Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com it could be a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrach, Grandmaster of the New York-based Krav Magy Federation, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain dominance over a rapist, whether he approaches you in front or from behind.
If they come closer to you from behind, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and “have a free course of shots.”
Then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder just before you throw it into your face with a free elbow.
Then he follows his knee to the weak, and while the attacker is in pain, you turn the gun out of his hand, hit the head in his face, and start retreating, while holding the gun aimed at him.
If an armed man in the front approaches you, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the fire line, grab a gun and twist it so that the bastard can't shoot.
At the same time, put strength into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then turn the weapon out of its tightening and start retreating, still staring at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Take a look at the video where you will see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get out of the crash - if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga - is to spend all the cash.
Traveller Ian Wright sweeps the dirtiest places in Europe into the travel guide
The British traveler has decided to undergo a heavy test of his immune system and a generous reflex - by slicing the dirtiest and most unpleasant places in Europe.
Moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, originating from Suffolk, smeared the euro banknote with his language, a piccadilly circus, a toilet button on a train and a Russian public phone.
Before approaching each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was going to do.
The experiment, which was based on the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of wiping the button of the rinser on a train that has been used by thousands of other people may seem completely repulsive, however, for example in the kitchen sink is actually much more harmful bacteria.
Throughout his journey across Europe, Ian Wright talked to doctors and healthcare specialists about strengthening intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing in his mouth left anything worse than the smell.
Ian Wright is famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on tours around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system completely safely - from public locks at train stations to a sink.
In the film, he says: “Since childhood, I didn’t care much about my health, and I put everything in my mouth, from clay to eating worms and muddy water.”
In the film, the publisher confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused were the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple stitch, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia, however, refused to sneeze after its luminometre showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands had less than 60.
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have filmed a traveler’s film called The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the movie, he said, "This is almost the slightest thing I've ever felt in the bathroom."
There's nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not going to oily anything because it's disgusting here.
Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D that help strengthen the gut bacteria and immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that they'd be watching get caught up and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We invented a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in broader contexts - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there is a great sense of humor in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s say this, Ian would lose my respect if he hurt something I wanted him to do – like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.”
Some things were naturally easier for Ian, while others were rather difficult.
I'm glad we've filmed some of those dirty things."
In 2015, Valio conducted a survey that found that 84 percent of the respondents linked lactic acid bacteria primarily to the health of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent of the respondents stated that they at least occasionally consume products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Family of Socially Necessary Before Moving Degraded Municipal Building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of the socially needed left <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 damage to their town hall after being charged with terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their violent eviction from the house, the officials of the housing association were shocked to find that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was broken, garbage was spilled on the floor, and the walls were crushed.
The family has already moved and is thought to be living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, Director of Housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried that the house would be saved.
She said: “For people here, it was a nightmare and I don’t think people should live like that.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property is likely to become known as the “not so nice part” of Cornwall.
The family is unfamiliar and their names are unfamiliar.
The couple have three sons who have occasionally lived in the house, and police said the terror regime that the family was involved in included street battles using baseball streaks, intimidation of the surrounding population, drug use, drug distribution and loud screams, quarrels and clashes.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned on the lease, was sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
Several rooms in the house, which may be ruined, have been found smelling garbage.
In the house from which drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was torn
Neighbors say they saw them on the street walking around, and people called the police here regularly.
Cornwall Housing displaced her and her partner violently from the house this week after they had an additional 11 weeks to displace them voluntarily.
Neighbors who were relieved of the eviction welcomed the fact that their lives were living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone at all."
We've lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, you can't count at all.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because there was an incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, supervisory manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the house was regularly called by the police
Waste and old toys were spilled in the bustling part of the town hall
She adds: “It’s a shame that a tenant has not been able to take responsibility for her own behavior and for her family’s behavior. Emigration is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very complex case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police from Devon and Cornwall, and the local community who have informed us courageously.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbours and at the same time bring the message that we will not tolerate unsocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the tenant who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
Polluted mattress that remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after moving
Workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage left displaced around the house.
In 2014, she carried out the shelves in the house and found over 70 grams of hemp, weights, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of holding B-class drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was allocated to the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are now thought to be living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will endeavor to evict tenants who violate the rules of their lease agreements
Angela Crow, from police in Denver and Cornwall, said the eviction was a clear message to other tenants who would continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity, and to those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
The police in Denver and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and non-social behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal frightened after low-flying military jet over beach
Tourists enjoying the sun’s rays in the Portuguese Aveiro were frightened to death
The Portuguese military aircraft P-3C Orion flew incredibly low
The military aviation said it was an exercise flight and insisted that there were no security threats.
The moment the low-flying squirrel fell over the crowded beach, panicked the frightened tourists.
Dramatic footage shows how a military plane reaches the distance almost to the touch of the sun from people on a sandy beach near Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of the jet engines, without seeing what emerged from the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the town of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few recreationalists who posted video footage of the dramatic flight on social networks, said: “The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to collapse.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed and really thought the plane would fall on my head.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were frightened as plane flew low from darkness
The Portuguese military said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on an exercise flight in order to identify fishing vessels off the coast and had to carry low, as that was the only way to check the ship.
The plane allegedly flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby forest fires, but the aviation maintains that the safety of people was not compromised.
This summer, forest fires destroyed parts of the mainland of Portugal and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese military said the pilot had to fly low due to dense fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from viewing.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify a fishing vessel as part of the training.
Half of funeral services do not comply with regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (<0xC4><0x8C>OI) found out this during its inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services most often do not inform the remainder of their prices or issue a written confirmation of the receipt of the order.
The <0xC4><0x8C>OI imposed 41 fines worth a total of SEK 73,000.
Today, her spokesman Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Fröhlich reported.
Inspectors found errors in 47 of 95 checks.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services have also sold products or provided services at prices other than the agreed upon.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and one seller used an officially unchecked gauge.
The inspection therefore banned the sale of 23 products for a total of SEK 7077.
It was about packaging for urns, candle covers and vases that were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Since there are still violations of the law in this specific area of services, the controls will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS has been killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultan, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, died in Syria.
Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer, said her family had heard of her death in Rakce in Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that it was likely killed during the Russian airstrikes in Raqqa, which is the backyard of the group in the country.
The Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
“One wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing — like a message and a warning to others that these are real dangers associated with the road to the war zone — is to discourage people from making decisions,” Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London arrived in February 2015 on a plane to Turkey and then on a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultan’s family learned that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and within a few months she became a widow.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, she will leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Senate leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Hillary Clinton's presidential election candidate will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel says the person who replaces the deceased judge of the Supreme Court will be elected by the future president.
Reid said during a conference call on Thursday that he believes Clinton will select Garland "with a certain degree of credibility."
Reid’s spokeswoman later said he didn’t talk directly to Clinton about whether Garland would nominate, and that he was just speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want someone else’s choice to “run the ship.”
Garland is the president of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said Republicans blocking Garland's appointment were "servants" and "poscocious" Republican candidates for President Donald Trump's office.
He said Trump doesn't fit in the office.
According to Treats magazine, there are naked calendars for “women and men”
Treats magazine is working closely with photographer David Bellemer to release the 2017 calendar, inspired by the Pirelli calendar of the 1970s.
But instead of unveiled celebrities, he tries to find the next generation of top models for his 2017 calendar.
Earlier this year, Treats President Steve Shaw told us that his magazine is full of nudity and is different from Playboy from old school because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Obviously, the calendar is also.
“We have to go back to displaying timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and let themselves be inspired by photographs of the female body,” Shaw said in a statement.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a wonderful piece of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person during open bankruptcies in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys gramophone records?
Vinyl love solitary men of middle age.
Before you decide to pay the comments section with peppery notes under the pseudonym All Lonely Men of the Middle Ages, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, so much discussed resurrection of gramophone records is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to love the originality of the possession of a physical object, but with the nostalgia of the Middle Ages.
Those who recently bought an album on vinyl are most likely people aged between 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
In fact, it’s not about accumulating an enthusiastic fan – all of this has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone records are more likely to want to retain their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were broadcast as a television report, I would be watched by a camera as I walk into a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent grey suit and wide gesture. Then I would stop, stretch my hands and say something authoritative like, "Let's go after it."
Well, let's take a look at it.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent sellers, now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, confectionery and office supplies - several fantastic specialized stores with desserts.
I'll probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a while. I'll stand up in the vicinity of different men in these stores and try to observe their age and emotional mood.
Stuart (55), a Glasgow native, who I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman about 20) has an afternoon meeting in London, a meeting, and a party for a party.
I asked him if he was a collector.
“I think so,” she says.
I have about three or four thousand recordings.
All those recordings lining the walls of his living room - in the picture above (the photo sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him until home).
This huge amount of albums and singles is also due to the fact that he can afford it: he can now buy the gramophone records he couldn’t afford when they went out, and he’s buying again what he sold in his youth and had no wine.
“A lot of what I’m buying is from the late 60’s and early 70’s. These are things that would be released when I was 11 or 12. Then I was too young and couldn’t get them,” she says.
He agrees that those who buy the recordings are probably introverts who like the company of themselves. And he adds: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez, 25, works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of the customers he meets are part of the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old gramophone records back.
According to my interviews, people used to get rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramophone records and bought a CD now sell their CDs to buy their gramophone records back,” he says.
This could explain the boom of lovers of gramophone records of a certain age.
But what is the supposed emotional importance of gramophone records?
It won’t take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that you’ll find a pleasant community of people with similar thinking in music stores.
According to Weza, some older customers are particularly depressed by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of gramophone boards may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of gramophone board packaging, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling a gap or possessing something material can bring some comfort,” says Wez.
I am a collector myself, and I think so with a lot of people.
It’s an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We’re all like their social workers!” says a co-worker from a bunch of gramophone records.
A survey by ICM in April found that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier hadn’t listened to it yet.
According to the survey, 41% of those surveyed have a phonograph that they never use, while 7% of those who buy phonograph boards do not have a phonograph.
At this point of the report, he probably seemed seriously worried while browsing the pile of compilation bossa nova.
The "trophy" aspect and the revival of interest is something that Jonny, 42, has noticed working in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
“Someone recently came in and said, ‘I don’t have a gramophone yet, but I want to buy it on Radiohead so we can display it on the shelf,’” she says.
The percentage is not high, but it does happen.
It’s more about the product page than about music.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a graph."
These are younger people, not those older, grown-up teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where at the moment almost an entire floor is reserved for gramophone records, has a much more diverse number of visitors upon my arrival.
There are couples of 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn’t as relaxed as the stores used to – from the speakers instead of tava jazz, the latest pop from Wild Beasts is full of synthesizers and sex, it’s good to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but you can hardly guess an opposing mental trauma when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks in Fopp for a few minutes and watches various gramophone records at a discount.
He's one of those who'd rather check out the expenses than spend the fever.
He says he doesn't make much money, so he doesn't seem to be collecting gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something like that. But the gramophone records have their charm... ," he sighs desperately.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a store that is supposed to have inspired a new generation of lovers of gramophone records: Urban Outfitters.
I look like I'm very excited about young girls in jeans and I'm watching a group of teenage girls who are just gathering around Polaroid cameras. Then father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley gramophone.
On the left is the staircase, the wall of which is covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophone records.
No one is looking at them - maybe just because they are just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's just a vinyl trick.
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for others, there’s not much to complain about.
It’s no surprise that the demographic area, where there’s probably more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where it’s most spent on the most luxurious goods that vinyl certainly is.
But while my findings show that YouGov results are accurate - that is, at least in gramophone record stores, they do not take into account a large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who actually exist in gramophone record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He certainly won’t spend Thursday morning drowning in the shops on Berwick Street, browsing the recordings, and avoiding looking at a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV moderator who hides behind the backs of middle-aged men who don’t know anything.
Green shark is the longest living turtle - video report
According to scientists, the Green shark has the longest average lifespan of all the giraffes on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who is studying sharks, says the recording shows a female, estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old, measuring five meters.
Court in France refuses to shut down shops in jungle refugee camp
A court in France has rejected an order by authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing in Calais this week, authorities ruled that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 interim stores where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, 50 centimes in the base, or in the interim restaurants.
The prefect’s office in Calais argued that the places need to be decommissioned because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations in the court state that shops and restaurants are vital and that free food offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups do not provide food supplements for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Controversial temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and food free to people in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 interim trades, but said the objections of the prefect of Calais were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have a much greater role than just serving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the Jungle Book Kids, a camp cafe run by a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals, English and French lessons, and asylum advice for hundreds of endangered minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect “children” cafes.
The Guardian received a letter stating that the closure of the cafe would be “a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated Friday that the number of refugees in the camp after a sharp increase in arrivals over the summer has risen to more than 9,000 - the highest number ever.
You thought he was dead.
It is also called Volleyball <0xC3><0x9A>stí.
"Since March, I have been able to train normally," he said at the start of the summer preparations in full force.
What's wrong with you?
I had a pulmonary embolism on both sides, and then heart problems.
Because when I was at a university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
I've had a collision for two years and I didn't know about it.
It hurts, no one found anything.
Then the collision got up.
The vein is damaged in the cavity, it will always hurt, especially when it gets swollen or changes the weather.
But nothing that would limit me, it's an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about life?
He had.
Last year I didn’t know I had an embolism at the Summer Tournament in D<0xC5><0x99>ev<0xC4><0x9B>nica, and I couldn’t move there at all.
I vomited blood last night.
The doctors told me that it was something completely different, I was completely cleared for another five days.
In fact, I thought I was dead, even my girlfriend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you compare to that?
I guess I had to experience it, now it's just going up.
I know I'm having some blood problems, I need to watch myself more when I'm flying somewhere.
But you can do everything about it.
Only when I wanted to go back to P<0xC5><0x99>íbrami preparation last year, there were still problems with the heart.
It's all right now.
Since March, I have been training myself at home to be able to play again.
I'm physically better off than I was before.
What do you expect from the mouth?
I'm glad the party looks good, I know most guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers who will come.
Hopefully we'll sit down humanly to make it work for us.
Will you lift your mouth?
It had a reputation for being different, but each season is different.
Brno was eight years ago, and now the second one is over.
There is a new team in the mouth, there are only a few players left.
It was the last one in the extraction, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
When we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see after the first round who's going to be apart, maybe we don't.
Is the Brom Coach a guarantee of success?
He is already experienced and experienced a lot of this, he will think of better than the last place.
But my arrival didn't have anything to do with it, I agreed earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, with one big friend and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won't say the name.
Mr. Brom finally came, and I'm glad.
He has a great name, he has been in good clubs, he has been training for many decades, he is a former good player.
It'll move us up.
What do you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to joke and I like to get an opportunity in a not so top-notch team.
I’ve been in P<0xC5><0x99>íbrami for two years, but the mouth is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team right now, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, Australian Boehm is already training in the mouth.
What does it look like?
I know him by the circumstances, we played against each other in the group at the university.
And sometimes we played there together, sometimes we sat together in the evening after the games, so we already know each other friendly.
We beat them 3:1, I put it to him at the start of the summer preparations in <0xC3><0x9A>stí.
She has a Slovak girlfriend, she is sympathetic.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze are coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote with an American, he looks like a good guy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
Did you contact the American?
It felt like a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so the one who makes it, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of players it is, I found myself on the internet playing, I saw some videos.
He seemed all right, the boy jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a couple of posts on Facebook, it seemed like a joke, it fell on us.
How do you look forward to the position of the recording unit?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only twenty-four years old and I don't have the guts to change it.
I'd rather be at the center of things, I'd rather lead the team than someone else lead it.
I guess I don't want to play anymore if I'm supposed to be a second recorder and devote myself to it full-time.
How many times have you been one?
Half a year in P<0xC5><0x99>íbram, when it didn't work for Kust as the captain, he got hurt, then there were problems with the money, and he left.
We've been up since then and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, of which I am the keeper, I replaced one and two.
It was an excellent year in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and I chose P<0xC5><0x99>íbram.
From there, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice wanted me, I stayed, but I did not finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
The gold number 22.
The short position remains the Phelps domain.
"To be on the stage winners again and to hear the hymn is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, with tears in his eyes again.
His fiancé and mother were smiling at the scene again, Boomer's son slept quietly with headphones on his ears this time.
I'm having an amazing week to finish my career.
"It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming racing and in a few hours it'll be over," he said.
In the final behind Phelps, silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won a long seat, was left just two seconds behind.
The bronze was won by the Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year’s World Championships.
After Alu Oerter (disc) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to master the same discipline in four games in a row.
After most of the race, Phelps was led by another American Ryan Lochte and domestic Thiago Perreira.
While the gold defenders in the final crawling fifties set to a crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the announcement of the position, he moved to the final of the race to the 100 metres butterfly.
The legend could not be obscured by the countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the character double - he also won the double track in Rio after a hundred.
In the final, he left 37 sets for Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, finishing third with Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While from last year's World Cup, Murphy has only a fifth place in the doubles, in Rio he became a characteristic king.
Larkina sat down from the throne of thought, and the same double had just succeeded at last year’s world championship.
At the Olympics, he won a medal.
Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuela shared gold on the crawler’s hundred.
For sixteen-year-old Oleksiak it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuel the second after the silver of the staff.
She was the first African-American to win gold at OH.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for all those who come after me, the sport becomes love for them and they get to where I am, Manuel said.
The third was Sweden’s Sarah Sjöström, who won the race for the 100 metres butterfly in the world record in Rio and still has silver from the skating duvet.
Australia's Cate Campbell has finished sixth in the world records.
Japan's Rie Kanet has won the bear double, for which it is the first Olympic medal in its twenty-seventh year.
It has no precious metals from the World Championships, with its maximum being fourth in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia’s Yulia Jefimov, who is faced with the indifference of spectators and rivals due to the start of the games despite the doping past.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court and I don’t know why I should always answer these questions.
“I’m so tired of it,” the Russian swimmer said.
Just before the start of the game, the CAS sports arbitration panel was able to get started in Rio.
They took care of my appeal and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, let them turn to the arbitration court, she added.
Hermann: Disappointed, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs had a special day.
Only less than an hour before the match, they found out who he was going to fight.
They had to handle the tactical preparation in a flash.
And then, in unconventional times, the game began on the small runway number one.
The first set did not start well, then they reached the jump of the opponent, but at 19:19 they did not manage to finish.
In the second they were clearly better and compared, but the decisive tie-break did not come out.
In particular, a series of damaged services meant a 10:15 loss and a draw with the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians," Hermann regretted.
How would you rate the match?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start before I played, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, in the last balloon I flew the intake I used to get used to.
We lost the set, which was key.
In the next set we joined them with an overview on the playground, another defense and pressed on the service.
In the tie-break there were terriblely damaged presentations, there we wore on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could have defeated the Russians.
Too bad the start of the first set, that’s where we got away.
We were able to download it, but we missed the points.
The second set was great and in the third decided the service.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points and that was about five points, and we made a lot of effort there.
It's a shame because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the small castle number one?
Slug: Similar to China in the adjacent courtyards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was an hour at night, completely silent, the music didn’t play, nothing.
That was the difference from the center.
We would not have chosen such conditions, but we cannot choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the name of the opponent an hour before the match?
Hermann: It was strange.
We started training for the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn’t do tactical preparation like the rest of the teams.
But Simon (Coach Nausch) used the tactics to almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had prepared a lot of tactical papers, so on this page we were pretty well prepared.
Do you remember when you would start a game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at 11:30, but not at 12:00.
Blok Russkaya Birlov in the play-off preschool at OH in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluk and Barbora Hermann in a play-off at OH in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Slukova: By playing the last two games in the group since the 10th, we had the regime shifted before.
This was two hours longer than that.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine that another sport has athletes who have to give their best performance in twelve hours.
But I think we've prepared as best we can.
We knew it would be, but it's not quite typical, and I don't think it's going to be my favorite time to play.
How do you assess the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the move from the group was our goal, on the one hand it’s okay, good.
We handled what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I’m going to get out of it and from tomorrow I’ll be reminded of the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big brother's here, the first sweeping SIM is coming.
You won't escape her.
The new rules should apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to obtain a SIM from one of the local operators while staying in Thailand.
Not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who work in Thailand, for example, or have been married there.
Takorn Tantasith, the secretary-general of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, said there would be no exceptions.
The national telecommunications regulator introduced the sale plan for SIMs intended exclusively for foreigners in early August.
The new measures, which will allow monitoring of their position, are set to be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of preserving national security, which will allow to address the crime committed by foreigners.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIMs help to identify people who exceed the allowed length of stay.
In the case of retailers within half a year, a special SIM for foreigners should also be revealed, along with a SIM exclusively for Thais.
The difference will be the tracking function, which will be permanently activated for cards designated for persons without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This feature is not for Thais at SIM, because we can always easily track them," Tantasith added.
It should be noted that prepayments are not as anonymous in Thailand as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires an identity document.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators distributed free start-up SIM to tourists at airports.
You were so completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand is also considering ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries including, for example, Malaysia or Singapore.
There is also a compulsory SIM registration, but the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the measure envisaged does not imply an obligation for foreigners to acquire a SIM when entering the country of the local operator.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of the country after crossing the border, i.e. after logging in to their network SIM, only know the relevant network information.
They know the phone number, but not the owner’s information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so boring that most tourists will start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
Attempts by the authorities to monitor the movement of foreigners have been legally criticized by foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in the context of privacy protection, compares the system to the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if a particular person is to be monitored.
Any abuse of the system will be subject to an indefinite penalty.
"If the service provider monitors the location of the SIM without a court order, it will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While there is currently a recycling of a specific number only after the 90-day period after which the SIM in question did not sign up to the network, a new number could be restored after fifteen days in the event of leaving Thailand.
A luxurious apartment in a new building in Vinohrad has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the care for the property is provided by the administrator.
The condition was enough parking spaces and elevator in the house, which essentially disqualified the older building.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with flooring, high energy demands and the like.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
Further interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The entire interior was designed for you by the architect Lenka Langer and her colleague Kamila Poláková from Artiga Studio.
Why did you just contact them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to everyone?
Cooperation with the architect would recommend to anyone, if he designs an apartment from the beginning, in fact, it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and, based on the client’s wishes, are able to suit the interior appropriately.
We worked with the architect Lenka Langer in our mountain apartment, based on the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even in the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrad.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-living space with a suitable background for a four-member family understood as a modern but not a cool interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and realize intelligent control of the household.
And, of course, the quality of the implementation had to be maintained.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you interfere with the final form of the interior yourself?
All designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, have been approved, however, the design has always been taken from the architects.
At the beginning, we decided what we expected from the design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to include in the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think it is our collection of mostly Czech authors including works by Karl Mali<0xC4><0x8D>, Karl Vysushil, Václav <0xC5><0xA0>pály or Otto Gutfreund the architects that helped to orient themselves in our taste.
Also the combination of black, white and nut wood was the idea of the architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, flooring, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. That, if everything fits together, we then together verified by means of visualization.
Were there any complications when you realized that made you have to give up the original ideas or, on the contrary, to join the new ones?
Probably only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at the moment it was possible to climb to the height of our floor for the first time, and they found that the views we planned were actually shadowing the surrounding building.
At that time, we literally changed the layout overnight from the base.
On the kitchen line and on the coating of the fireplace wall was used gypsum.
In the interior, wooden surfaces of complementary leather are then dominated, for example on the dining and bar chairs Norma from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes here or is there something you would like to have differently today?
I believe that this is a modern air interior, which primarily fulfills its purpose.
We are not going to change, most adjustments after moving took place in the level of shade and inhabitation of the terrace.
Perhaps the only exit is to the floor, where the nutwood appears to us as too tasty in a house with a dog.
The word architect, Ing. arch. Lenka Langer and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of a new building, so it was possible to carry out a completely new layout solution and several further modifications within the building.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of light bulbs in the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilets.
This allowed us to get the daylight into the darker spaces of the apartment.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the construction arrangements that was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You are from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, just outside the Spanish borders.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, and then I got to work in one magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere between people.
I thought that every Frenchman was very negative.
People in France are negatively aligned in general, but it has worsened lately.
Interestingly, you are talking about negativity.
This is how some people view the Czech nature.
Believe me, you are not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not be able to do so when they come to France because they do not perceive it as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
A big theme is money.
People feel like they have little money, but the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is a problem with the behavior of the people towards the Muslims.
That's totally incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was basically looking for a job anywhere else and I found a job at Air France here in Prague.
I admit I didn’t know Prague at all.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my dad even told me about what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I didn’t know what to expect from Prague at all.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine I wouldn't live here.
Was that a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mainly because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it’s because I don’t speak Czech, so I can’t catch any negative reactions or overtones, but I feel like people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress as I like, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is still looking at you unpleasantly, for example, when you have special clothes and the like.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think people who've got to worry about things like that.
Where do you work now?
After working at Air France, I worked for one travel website for a while.
Then, with another friend, we set up a website where people are offering and looking for shared housing.
We are currently operating only in Prague, but we would like to extend it to all of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here, who are Czechs from half, and two more Czech friends.
I must say that the other specificity of the Czechs is that at first they hold more distance.
He won't let anyone get into the body right away.
That’s quite a difference from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on their faces.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural issue, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have it quite simple in Prague, because maybe everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in the food.
I’d like to learn Czech, but I don’t have that much time.
And by at least being able to communicate a little bit in English, I don’t have such a need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone to help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions as well?
Is it because you are a Muslim?
Basically not.
Maybe it’s also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience is attacking me.
My manager, the Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They are not French, they are Africans.
It really touched me.
But if someone had a problem with being a Muslim, I hadn’t done it.
And despite the fact that my colleague once warned me of some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go to the center, they'd give me up there.
Anti-Muslim protests are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that today, anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I have not been able to imagine that something like this would happen in France.
It’s not just about Muslims.
In addition, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Quran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect your faith?
It's very difficult.
I feel cold and guilt, even if I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the reports of violence too much, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met in the square of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í from Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians were demonstrating against violence.
Did you record that?
I didn't know.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they have to do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn’t do?
Are you meeting other Muslims in Prague as well?
My colleagues, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have a pretty wild discussion about Islam, because we all perceive it a little differently.
I'm from France, so I went through a different education, they may have learned Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate status of a woman.
How do you feel?
I don't seem submissive in any way.
Quite the opposite.
I am a woman, I have strength.
It is also related to the fact that you do not wear any head cover.
Like Hijab?
And it's mostly signed on to the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a fundamental Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she just doesn’t wear a scarf.
She's always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on how everyone interprets it.
When a person reads the Qur’an, he should make his own opinion on these things.
So when I read a passage in the Koran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I thought to myself, “I am not the wife of the Prophet, so why should I hide?”
On the other hand, I respect it, and when I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, for example, where the hats are required, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so well anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine that I would be raising my own children here.
Prague is the ideal city for that.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians, protested against violence.
Yachting Kozelska Fencl wind in Rio welded to the procedural crossings.
Friday sea rides in the Brazilian Rio de Janeiro were made by Czech yachter Veronice Kozelské Fenclové.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved to tenth place before the final two runs.
This would ensure that the Czechs participated in the final race.
You pick packages like pokemons.
They want to compete with carriers.
Behind the idea of using the already planned routes for the transport of shipments is television director Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
The idea inspired the life of three applications with different geographical ranges.
We launched the National Transportation App in May.
At the moment, there are thousands of cities and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic we want to learn this first before we focus more on abroad, says in an interview for iDNES.cz a manager of forty-one years.
How does the Transfer App work and who can benefit from it?
You will download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and the details of how large the package can be transferred and how much you want it to cost.
Somebody's asking for a ride again that day.
When the route and delivery time matches, this is matched and both will receive mutual notifications.
At this point, a chat will open, where the couple will agree to a transfer.
How many people do you think would have to register in order for each package to always find its own courier?
I don't know the ideal state, I can't guess how many registered and how many routes it takes to make the coverage completely optimal and each offer matched with demand.
It already works on the main trails and it is logically easier than it is to travel between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
So far, people are building trust and finding out that no one is running away with the package.
You haven't had to deal with this case yet?
How many users have the service after two months of launch?
Currently, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people making roads.
We see this as a success and we believe that more will be packed.
Doesn't it threaten the sender to wait too long?
We hope that we will be competing for large conglomerates only because we are able to deliver things on the same day and for a fraction of the price.
With a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
Here you will pay a hundred or less, because this is the path that someone is already taking.
Should traditional carriers worry about potential customer losses in the future?
We hope that's the way it is.
The market has a huge potential, fed here by huge transnational carriers, as well as the trading chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality is not responsible for what they pay for.
No one wants to find a ticket in the box with a message that he's supposed to pick up the shipment at the branch, first the day after 19:00.
At the time, I needed the package for six hours and I was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that will not stifle anyone and send a signal to the competition, let them try.
Marek Greger (41) and Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka (39).
None of them have ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as manager of the music club, Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka as television director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses packages to transport already planned routes between the world’s metropolises, especially by plane.
In 2015, they submitted a project for the processing of the company, which created applications such as for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or <0xC4><0x8C>SFD.
The programming lasted three quarters of a year and the application was launched in March 2016.
The Transmission apps began to develop in December last year and released this year in May.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The Mesikem and Mesikem Profi apps were developed from January this year and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to make all of these apps that will one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to adjust the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The shared economy has been a topic lately and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Don’t you worry about working in an area that no one can say much about yet, where are the boundaries of sharing and where are the grey economies?
It’s the same, just another product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be the next dick in the eye through the grey economy.
But even if someone saves and someone earns, it’s not about circumventing financial authorities and tax checks.
Each user, on one side or the other, will be invited to donate his or her income if he or she makes a profit from it.
What makes you think the service has such great potential?
The shipper saves and the carrier earns, or reduces the cost of travel.
That is the strong idea that binds interest on both sides.
In the age of social networks that people share, we would like this to get closer to the opposite.
They can create beautiful stories, people are happy that they have helped someone and will tell them about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys, or pills.
I think people have been lacking personal access for a long time, we say about this app that it is a service to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package will not flow?
Each user of the application, along with the registration, scans the citizenship card and indicates a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give service and credibility to man.
The couriers also collect the stars based on the ratings of the senders.
We also offer insurance, we are still adjusting the details.
The courier shall be liable for uninsured shipment in case of loss or damage, but shall not be liable under criminal law for the content if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If he is stopped by the police and found in a sealed package in his suitcase a samopal or ten kilograms of hashish, criminal responsibility falls on the sender.
Is there a threat of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
If necessary, they are registered by a supervisory authority, which will be the only one who will be able to look at them, even if we are not able to see them ourselves, the data is protected against abuse.
How much money will he receive after successfully delivering the shipment to the courier?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he tells himself.
An additional percentage is charged to the sender for contacting.
This money is our profit, but it’s only a few percent because we want to push the volume.
No one can accuse the courier of not delivering the shipment when it is actually delivered, the takeover and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any limitations?
Whether in relation to the size or the contents of the package?
You can transfer anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as an egg plate and large as a beer bass.
Then there are no further restrictions, and if someone has a seat in the car, for example, they will take the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier can see what they want after it.
You don’t even need to pack things unless you want to hide the contents.
You put the forgotten shirt in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the ministry?
My friend got the idea more than two years ago, when I didn’t pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo of an app with a multinational reach that targets mainly passengers by plane.
At that moment, I told him I was not looking for an investor, but I would like to stand by him and put savings into it.
The development took another year before we founded Shippansee LTD in London because of the greater credibility of the whole product.
But this is not the version that you are focusing on now.
No, we focused on marketing in the Czech Republic, where we are trying to catch up on the app, because it all had birth pains and there is still something to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to customer feedback and we do not deal with the foreign market at the moment.
We know it’s a long-distance run, but we don’t brag, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were upgraded in some way.
The transfer was created when we thought that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application for the moon is local, for the city.
But it can send the package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the Transfer, but the difference is that you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator on your mobile.
The app for couriers who want to feed on it, we have called the Messiah Profi.
So can someone make a profit by picking up packages around the city?
Exactly, the latest app will download in Prague for example a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the most of the trip to work.
Now, just like everybody's mad at those pokemons, they can collect all the same things.
A person sees where the orders are in the city, comes to it, clicks on it, and sees when it has to be delivered and the shipment is transported.
It is set cheaper than competing services.
At this point, we are still making a web interface that will be a complaint for companies to send shipments, fill in data about them on the web, or create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice them using the service, for example, every month.
Are you now dedicated to the project full-time?
We are exhausted, but we normally have it when we are employed, so that we can enjoy and develop the project.
There is no strong transnational investor behind us, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped into it with other incentives and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to cope with us to anchor the non-Czech market, but who should with apology go with us to the global product and become another huge player in the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story of Titanfall 2 is about to bring almost forgotten diversity.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will, according to the first information, be sharper than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is to be based on the concept of grid welding in the first part.
Therefore, you can look forward to freedom of movement, which, in addition to running, includes the possibility of using a combat titanium.
In addition to the action passes, the game will also contain levels focused on the inverted movement.
They will resemble platforms and include rebounds.
Therefore, it is essential to overcome them, for example, double jumps, running through the walls and a rope slide.
In addition, sometimes enemies will also need to be eliminated.
There will also be no shortage of maps reminiscent of fake spots and levels with special concepts.
In one example, it will be possible to lift and assemble platforms and close huge doors.
You will adjust the shape of the battlefield.
Thanks to this, the pace of the game should oscillate between an angry action and quieter moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We'll be playing for Jack Cooper's pedestrian, dreaming of a career as a pilot.
At the beginning of the campaign, Cooper, along with Captain Lastimous, finds himself lost on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there will be no wildlife there to shout to him.
In addition, Lastimosa sustains fatal injuries during an accident, and Cooper is therefore tasked with executing Captain Titan.
His dream of a pilot’s career comes true so sooner than he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot repair.
There will also be talks of Cooper with Titan.
Players will be served as a source of information about the soldier’s past, but at the same time, personalized robot communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when titanium drought is going to eliminate all the injuries that threaten Cooper at a planned jump.
The first information about the Titanfall 2 campaign was provided by the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be able to be evaluated in two months and Bonusweb will give you the first impressions from the online game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 will be released on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand is alive, but the original publishing house remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changed its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the publishing house, THQ acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and company name in 2013.
Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and Red Faction Collection.
In addition, 23 more games are created for the publishing house and 13 of them have not yet been released by the company.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a twenty-year-old man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first they obviously tried for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she was like that before me.
She's totally mad at him.
In the first few days, her voice even changed, she had such a girl, a lover message.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
I've watched it all.
He went out of work regularly at half-quarters, so she always went shopping at three.
She tried to see him at least every day.
I later found out they were meeting at his barn, in the laundry room.
How many times I knew they were there.
I had my keys, he was determined to get them there.
But I don't know why, in the end, I've always been sitting at home.
I've never been able to go there, to take that decisive step.
You may be laughing at me, but I believe that my wife controlled me mentally.
Soon I found out that I was in control, that I was going to do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just a bitch.
At the time, my neighbors told me they knew about it.
I was such a fool that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke down, it would be bad.
That it would affect everyone in the family, it was only the daughter's idea.
So I always postponed it, over and over.
But one day I went to his apartment to help with something in the laundry.
He went there with me, and I told him that I got anonymized, that he was meeting my wife, and that he was testifying.
I asked him what he would tell me.
He stood there, shook his shoulders, looked at the ground and said no word.
Then I also met his wife on the way out of the store at that time.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't tell me anything.
No one told me anything then.
I'm the kind of person who's never gone anywhere, who's having trouble getting to know someone and finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I always hoped that one day it would end.
I thought I'd forgive her all of this, and life would go on.
But it wasn't.
And I've basically never had to deal with it all.
I still have it in me today.
I used to say it to her quite often, but in the end I left it alone.
He's still living in the next house and I'm still living with her.
It's more than my wife's housewife.
At home she always did everything - cooked, washed, cleaned.
She's working.
I think she's always tried to make sure I don't have any other reason to complain.
And it can be said to be good.
But sometimes I'd like to hug her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me she never loved me.
She loved me and loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I see that he loves him to this day, he is her god.
And I don't like life like that.
Already when it started, and I was very ill-treated, I once told her that she didn’t want to live with me, and I asked her what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree with it or not.
And I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought, and in the end she said, "But there's enough room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
After the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up its fight against radical Islamists and the government calls for help from the local Muslim minority.
“If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of religion,” said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritually-educated people in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where preachers often come with money vaccinated with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
By that time, it had contributed to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that financed their construction.
Soon, however, internal contradictions struck her, and therefore she never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be led by former Minister of the Interior and Defense Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as supporters of the secular state.
In France there are about 2,500 mosques and prayers, some 120 of which serve radical Islam.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled some 80 Islamic clergymen from the country, and several more dozens are considering this step.
This week, the German police also attacked the jihadist clergy.
The Imams allegedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where the faithful allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Shortly after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate was set in France about a new institution that would replace the dysfunctional foundation.
They all accelerated further terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists on behalf of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic resources and to supervise imams.
However, it is not yet clear where he will get the finances, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is the special fee for halal food, i.e., meat originating from defeats according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal food vendors for granting permission.
A portion of the money would then go to the foundation’s budget.
A contribution of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 could also be paid by French pilgrims who travel to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them come from France on a traditional trip to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only publishers who have undergone educational programmes at the universities in France should be active in the mosques.
As a result, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government also shut down radical mosques.
"Since December, we have closed 20 of them and others will follow," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
"There is no place in France for those who report hate and do not respect our country's principles, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously wounded by an unknown gunman on Friday morning at a shopping mall in northern Zaragoza, reports the Independent newspaper.
The shooting occurred after a woman and her daughter left the garage spaces in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the mall, from where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by her uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to be provided for the men in critical condition.
The act took place around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the Autonomous Region of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish agency Europa Press, Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Served with bacon, wakame almonds, ginger and chili sauce.
Summer wishes light, well-educated food, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our own tastes and our own head.
And so from the summer garden smells grilled garlic, stew, pork stew.
Not too healthy, not too light, but sometimes with the exception of salad or fried vegetables.
True, grilling is time-saving and cooking, in addition, it is a social matter and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make well slices that specially serve, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time it is not necessary to cook, bake, fry or distill anything for a long time.
And they're going to contribute to our health.
Whether it’s homemade sushi or sashimi, where high-quality raw materials and a few well-adjusted griffons are enough to make the preparation already fun and the food itself a real exotic delight.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today’s recipe.
There is even more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice.
The paper can only be softened in the water for a moment, and then it depends only on the imagination of the cook, how he intends to play with fillers and accessories.
There's no almonds like almonds.
The advantage of a number of Asian dishes today is that the raw materials are already generally available.
Including a loaded sweet-acid herb, which is one of the basic flavors of accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the real pink guru has a unique spicy sharpness and at the same time a delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several types of vinegar and ginger.
So just buy a bag of the appropriate size, and an attachment with demonstrable antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are especially used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes in a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
The long ribbed banana leaves are widely used in a number of countries in Asia or South America as a "help" to prepare a variety of baked, cooked and roasted dishes that are packed in them similarly to alabala.
The banana leaf then conveys a specific taste to the dish.
With us they can be bought in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut in the form of wheels.
However, choose only the leaves of the saturated green, and thus healthy - unbroken and without spots.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad made of wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
You can buy it frozen again.
Those who often eat or prepare sushi will probably know a lot of madness.
In Japan, it is one of the most important types of seaweed, from which the so-called nori leaves are produced by slicing, grinding and drying, i.e. plates intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame – a dark green shrimp growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido – is also fresh and dried and is as popular as a nori shrimp.
By the way, who wouldn’t know the miso soup with wakame, allegedly Asian women use it long ago to recover after childbirth.
And at all, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses the blood, strengthens blood circulation, even allegedly prevents gray hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and sliced wakame also serves as spices, for example to taste rice.
Fresh warts are first allowed to drain in water, then rinse, put in boiling water and boil for half a minute.
Then they cool in ice water, cut out the middle ribs and continue to be adjusted, such as a favorite salad.
However, buying it already ready, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So it is left only to wrap the roller with easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a bomber of longevity.
If you resist and don't come up with a barbecue.
Eat healthy, light and summertime.
The Asians know how to do it.
You just need a few special ingredients and a little bit of skill, and you have an interesting fresh food that tastes deliciously combined.
And it's ready for two.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white crustaceans, 100 g of green pepper, 60 g of salad cucumbers, 60 g of wakame almonds and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a spoonful of black sesame, a spoonful of chili sauce, 20 g of manga and 40 g of chopped guar, a little pine nuts.
First, we'll make the threads.
Pour the rice paper into cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait until it softens.
In the meantime, boil in hot water for a short time, after about three minutes, let them cool quickly into ice water so that they do not lose color.
Put a vegetable fillet on the allowed paper and pack it.
The filling is prepared from white shrimp, carrots and salad cucumbers, which we cut into fine nutmeg, mix them with a sweet chili sauce, add the chopped coriander, thoroughly mix and put on rice paper.
On the banana leaf, place the christening sprouts, add the wraps and finish the whole dish with a range of wakame, stuffed with baking soda, a bowl of manga, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must be satisfied with silver in seven-time rugby, Fiji picks gold
The impressive performance of Britain in seven-day rugby ended in a devastating track on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated in the final game on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians gave a master lesson in processing, folding, moving, supporting game, running on the line and brutal forces – and won the gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an unprecedented price of comfort in the form of a silver medal – for Britain the third day – and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural seven-day rugby tournament, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The scoring victory over South Africans 7:5 in the semi-finals on the same day is perhaps frozen in the final.
However, Fiji in its form would also be defeated by a 15-member team in full health.
It may not be comforting for the British, but they can be glad that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their necks tomorrow: the head coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, former England boss from Wimbledon.
The United Kingdom has insulted the road.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
The only one lost here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began magnificently, the British pioneers reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and other co-players, it was like running behind a row of buses on the move and the World Cup champions led 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau came out of the corner.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and the British hard to touch the ball.
Great Mitchel tried to stop the giant Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only Fiji slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremaluu dropped the touchdown to the right corner and the Brits lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one after his return, and the hours were still more than 1 minute left ... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravava then penetrated the small Brits and landed on the line where he scored.
After the conversion to the 29:0 state, a pause followed.
It was as if Fiji were born for the rugby 7s, while the British were still learning to hand over.
That's the way it is.
The British made massive changes after the half-time and the Fijian effort stopped... for a total of four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after the brilliant Fiji midfielder Joshua Tuisov went on.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, throwing the touchdown in the left corner to an increase of 36:7. However, the game had long been won by the Pacific Islanders and their fans were willing to sing, wave flags and dance.
It was hard not to admire Fiji’s completely delightful approach.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame further softened the Fijian victory attempt.
A whistle was ringing, the Fijians hugged and the British fell on the lawn completely solidified.
Before that same day, Fiji defeated Japan in the semi-finals by 20:5 and Britain defeated the South African Republic in the narrow semi-finals - a difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half to lead, but Dan Norton broke through the defense line in the second half and scored under the hook.
The great late quarterback Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother from England's fifteenth team, secured the victory - and finally also the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired the fight against cancer to win the race
In these games you will not find more emotional gold - and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during the 220 penalty shootouts in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio de Lagoa.
While there were two, there were three voices on the ship. When the ship flew on the level of the second Olympic gold in the women's doubles race, there was still the voice of coach Robin Williams on the ship. They were the first women in the history of such a British sport.
Their preponderance was absolute, overall it was their 39th race in which they remained undefeated.
What we see — two excellent athletes flying across the water level with the elegance of the squirrel — does not fully reflect the nature of the victory.
Behind every gold medal of the dedication there is a battalion of hand aids that make a difference piece by piece. And no hand was more helpful than the hand of a coach 30 months ago who did not know if he would experience this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I had bladder cancer that could be operated on, and I underwent this surgery.
Anything could happen without surgery.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's going to change your view of things a little bit.
The cancer was discovered by Williams in December 2013.
The lucky thing for the whole trio was that he was able to start treatment in early 2014, off-season, and thus reduce the drop to a minimum - if that's what we can call it in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
It was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Engaging in itself is the way, but this was a bit more demanding.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, speaking less than usual as he tried to cope with his own turmoil.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who has a mission in Aghanistan, said, "I've been with emotions at the bottom this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
Again, it emphasizes how much it means to me, how much we worked with Helen and Robin as well.
So far, it has been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he has a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wish for a better person for training, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The couple set an astonishing rhythm that their rivals couldn’t cope with.
Even in the final 500 metres, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began approaching, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
At the most, we were focused at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to let yourself be kidnapped.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn’t want to achieve something famous.
We didn’t like the fireworks today, we just wanted to get started, go out and win the race, which we succeeded.
The couple will take a year to think about it before they decide what will happen next.
Glover is getting married next week, and her next one is television adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel a lot better than that," she said.

Prison?
Rather let people drive for free, says taxi driver Rube<0xC5><0xA1> to break the lawsuit.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate in Prague have been charged, the <0xC4><0x8C>T said.
You've been filming a number of reports in which you've revealed deceptive practices even those who are supposed to be in the group that's going to be in court.
You've been faced with some unpleasant clashes with uncovered actors.
How much is the report on the complaints of members of the organized group broken for you?
I've been waiting for a trial.
I'm mostly curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
That's for nothing.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them so that all people will drive for free.
That's a somewhat personalized solution.
Does this mean that you do not consider the punishment as sufficiently effective?
It's enough for me that some of them are so afraid that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a pingle, the other weighs a pizza, and the other is completely out of it.
Theoretically, the defendants can be sentenced to two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with taking away my freedom.
I think that's a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in this case, is nonsense.
People like that should return to the company they took.
For a quarter of a century, they have done this by destroying our country’s name and robbing people freely.
So let's get them to make a good card right now, and weigh people out for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work like a public-profit job.
As someone goes to collect the garbage, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll eventually get a condition and they won't mind.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC4><0x8D>ka Film Academy in Py<0xC5><0xA1>ka and then at Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Bati University in Zlín.
It belongs to people in the Czech Republic who started with viral videos and videos directly for the website.
He works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of shows, and is now preparing the Prague Guide, which is primarily intended for foreign viewers.
Rube<0xC5><0xA1> advises them in the form of short reports, which services in Prague should be avoided and which, on the contrary, it recommends to use without fear.
Previously, he filmed a series with the titles How to Do, City of Cheats?, Life in Luxury, A Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
In the complaint, they are referred to as an organized group.
The police have been watching her for months.
Can such a network of deceptive taxi drivers be called a mafia?
They're such cute mafias, not the ones we know from Kmotra.
It's more about the mafias - juniors, but they're certainly organized.
It’s just that they’re guarding each other’s staffs (taxi stations).
Prague is completely fragmented.
I found that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Vary (disco club)
Everyone just watches their own place and each group is somehow organized.
It's probably a complex network.
Only seven people, six taxi drivers and a former highway officer who warned the driver against checks were charged.
As you say, unwanted phenomena have not disappeared from the streets.
So, what percentage of the Prague taxi fraudsters in the taxi service is that, according to your estimate?
That's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still there.
For example, I am talking about Ales Ryja<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he drives a telescopic case in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at the Charles Bridge and drives people.
The last time I went with him, he wanted me seven hundred miles away.
The police did not arrest him for any reason.
They picked only a few people from the whole big group.
The same is true in other places in Prague.
Thus, by the accusation of seven people, it is difficult to wipe out the already famous Prague scumbag, which seems to have a much larger dimension.
Of course, it's not at all.
It will help, but not all evil will be wiped out, that's true.
Do taxi drivers who steal foreign tourists appear all the time in the same places you showed in the reports, i.e. at the Charles Bridge or on Paris Street?
Yeah, that's right.
In these locations, they stand every day and violate adverts every day.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It's not even the Kocours anymore, but it's a complete indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
However, some of them, even if only part of the group, will go to court.
It's a breakthrough.
So I have to ask myself: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as an accomplishment, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and will always be to make the center of Prague better.
And even if I feel like I need to get a little better, I will continue to do so.
It is necessary to press the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to get him out of here.
You can't settle down with that.
But that’s not the case, of course there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them right in the taxis?
Sometimes I do test rides and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week I caught a taxi driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 kroner for three kilometres, although he later claimed that it was an amount of 56 kroner (he used a 10-character trick).
He had a statement on it, the cops arrived, and this cabman was so cute that he was still following the cops and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
A taxi driver hit a decimal point and stole 357 crowns from tourists.
Can it be said that the audacity of deceptive taxi drivers did not fade even after you showed in your footage the faces of those who billed nonsense amounts for a short ride?
Their audacity is still unbelievable.
How'd it go with the taxi driver claiming <0xC2><0xA3>56?
The police sent him away with the fact that he was unable to discuss with him on the spot because he had issued an invoice.
And that will, I think, be a problem in that court as well (six taxi drivers and one ex-official).
On the one hand there's a taxi driver with his bills, on the other hand, the police.
However, according to the Supreme Administrative Court's decision, the master may not use secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I filmed the pieces about their frauds, the taxi drivers themselves warned me about this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the footage only for reporting.
Are you worried that this fact could protect them from the court?
I hope that every judge understands that no taxi driver could ride six or ten crowns a mile because he would not enjoy it.
You talked about a ten-character trick, which is borrowed especially from underwater taxi drivers in front of foreign clients.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they afraid to continue using this fic after publishing your reports?
I think we've popularized this trick by broadcasting the show on the contrary.
I recently went with a taxi driver, bragging in front of me that he was the honest taxi driver.
Then I noticed a black card sticking on the side of the taximeter.
When I asked him what it was, he said, "You know what it is."
If the taxi drivers weren't overly fined, could they be warned by the court with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can deter them from fraud?
You've talked about how you think they'll always find a way to cheat.
I don't think there's anything to distract them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight more to get them out of there seriously.
I have to say from my experience that these fair taxi drivers in Prague are fortunately dominant.
But do they want to go against those who ruin the reputation of their service?
They have taste, but they lack the mind.
He can't walk very hard and can't say exactly what he wants.
When they organized the demonstration (due to the proposal for a comprehensive restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krná<0xC4><0x8D>ová), it didn’t seem very clear what they really wanted.
They once said they didn’t protest against Uber, they just wanted to have the same conditions as the service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and it only created the best possible advertising for Uber.
How overall do you assess the approach of the Prague Master in solving the problem of driving override?
It's obvious that she had to get in until the criminal police came in to solve something.
The master was short on it.
They had a card there that conveyed the information, which means that the taxi department had been doing its job for several years completely useless.
I hope that this official will be charged with all the sluggish checks until the last check, so that he can see what he's done.
That's what I think is the worst.
I even went on a check-up ride with him, which I found out only afterwards from their schedule.
It’s been a few months since the last episodes of the series were released.
What's the response?
I think mainly of the foreign audience, which is actually the series that is most focused on.
Every time I have friends from overseas, I leave them the videos.
And then when we go down the Old Town Square, they're surprised that the same people that are seen on the footage are seriously standing there.
Unfamous Prague celebrities.
Oh, really.
I would build a pond around them so that people would look at them.
The Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need it?
Oh, yeah.
I'm driving with services that I don't have to pay in cash, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also a lot of dishonesty that are fair.
I've only taken a taxi on the street since then.
When I got into the car, the driver said, "Well, you have the courage."
Bem in disguise for an Italian tourist.
False practices of taxi drivers were written in 2005.
In the same year, the former mayor Pavel Bém went on a check-up ride in disguise for an Italian tourist, and immediately on his first attempt, the driver killed her by two hundred.
But the editor Rube<0xC5><0xA1> had worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him 820 kroner for a ride from the Old Town to Wenceslas Square, which amounts to about 195 kroner per kilometre, according to the reporters.
The Prague Magistrate set a maximum price of 28 crowns per kilometer.
There are also other surprising amounts in the recorded reports: for example, the two-kilometre road from Paris to Truhlá<0xC5><0x99>ská cost a tourist 400 kroner.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
For example, six hundred crowns will be charged for a ride to Angel, which is 2.5 kilometers long.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, the more without chemistry and the longer, the better.
The impurities of it go well, even if sometimes the dirt has to be put down by a scalpel, it needs to be stretched out from the folds.
It’s not easy and it’s not going fast, Vanesa Trostová from Old<0xC5><0x99>ichov in Hayes approached her work.
The hood down in front of it: the graveyard is surrounded by a carcass, after which it is necessary to go up and down again innumerable times.
“The restaurant should be careful, patient and uncomplicated in the work environment,” she said.
In Frydlantsk it is not by far her first restoration work.
Thanks to her, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the rear tract of the Frydlant Town Hall were restored, and the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Záti<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC4><0x87>, St. John Nepomuk in Frydlant, Piet in the Frydlantian Circuit of Nozlantha at Prydlantha Street, and Mariaupk<0xC3><0xBD> F.
The restoration of the tomb of Melchior, Kry<0xC5><0xA1>tof and Katerina from Redern began in Frydlanta in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is purified from the application of impurities and crosses, the loosened stone parts are secured against the fall and shift; they will either anchor to the wall or to each other.
The treatment and preservation of the surface is also awaited.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gold again.
"It will then begin with the golding of inscriptions on marble plates with pure tile gold," V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Sobotová, the State Memorial Office's spokeswoman, said.
There's no record of the past that the grave would go through some repairs.
At a closer glance, they occupy holes drilled in marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains after decorating the graveyard.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the invasion of Sweden during the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
Literally, the tomb was opened, she noted.
In the Church of Finding the Holy Cross there are restaurateurs with a slight excess as at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tombs that were underwater, the baptistery was restored, wall paintings in the tomb and now the tomb.
"We would also like to go to the showcase in the future," Sobotová said.
The church is differently in very good condition, every year we invest money in maintenance and repairs.
Restoration work on the restoration of the Redernov cemetery will amount to a total of 128 thousand kroner.
They will be paid out of subsidies, the city will not put any of its money into this part of the renovation.
One hundred thousand crowns will go out of winning the 2015 Historic City Regional Cycle Competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said Mayor of Frydlantu Dan Ramzer.
Release of the prize for restoration of the tomb was decided by the representative.
Expert opinions on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparisons with the Czech Capital Market (PX) within a month and a half.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which underwent a 12% adjustment in February, is at a new historic high today, and has already accounted for 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
The iron rule is thus reaffirmed that traders should never, in the long run, go against the interests of central banks, which have achieved theirs forever so far.
In a situation where U.S. stocks are at a historic high, volatility is once again disappearing, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets have grown satisfactorily and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative release of the U.S. central bank and when, like today, the volatility index (VIX) remains stable.
And don't do that either.
Although the Fed continues to prepare markets for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative releases in Europe and Japan are in full swing and last week the Bank of England, which in the next six months will buy bonds in <0xC2><0xA3>70.
The new wave of quantitative release thus pushes even lower yields and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That is, of course, the question of a million.
But there are no risks at the moment, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market is stabilizing and in China, and Brexit is no longer essentially a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if we live in a similar climate.
Too bad Juncker's not studying Klaus!
I am very happy that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult work, Juncker, the head of the European Commission, said, when French politics (really experienced, because so many multinational political functions are thrown out of the way, that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to overcome from the European Commission.
Juncker’s choice sparked hints of hope that it is in the EU’s serious interest to look for a future form of friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most British media accepted Barnier’s name as Juncker’s act of war.
Barnier is a rocky European federalist.
He hates the UK.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was responsible for the reform of European banking law.
It was conceived as only he could grasp it: the fierce enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of free market and the model of capitalism.
The proponent of multilateral regulation was co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union, and he has endorsed everything that comes from London’s financial centre City, enforcing legislation on the tightly frozen regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a tough, unwavering and, of course, a reckless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, we should not forget the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak federation, to which the discernment, insight and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus have so much contributed.
Even today, Czechoslovaks can be their closest friends and allies.
Too bad Juncker didn't learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this one.
It would be for the good of all!
An earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin's ruler released his close friend Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday dismissed Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno.
The Russian media reported on this with a call for a press release to the Kremlin.
Putin said that Ivanovic would leave at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast by Rossija 24, the president said he was following Ivanov’s wishes when he took office, that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for no more than four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov will be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the president’s administration, now led by Ivanov’s current representative Vajno, is considered relatively surprising.
Ivanov, aged 63, is named one of Putin’s closest associates.
For example, this former KGB officer in the past held the position of Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will also leave the chair of the President’s Security Council.
However, Ivanov said during a meeting with Putin that the length of stay at the head of the administration of the head of state is in fact a record.
It lasted for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already been replaced in this function.
Neither the Kvitova nor the deblists of Uncle <0xC5><0xA0>afárov will play in the finals.
So far, none of the tennis matches on Friday have managed to turn into the finals.
Petra Kvitova was the first to lose her fight, which was followed by the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig in sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, the Czech deblysts <0xC5><0xA0>afá<0xC5><0x99>ívá and St<0xC5><0x99>ícová followed Kvito.
Williams's sister-in-laws defeated the first set after winning, but lost two sets and the Russians eventually won the set in the shortened game.
The second set then lost a 4-6 ratio.
The Czech skier Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Synek won his semi-finals overview when he defeated the second Damir Martin from Croatia despite his release in the final by almost a second.
Today good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said the Son.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight for the process.
So it took some power to them, it could be easier tomorrow.
But I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, it’s just playing cards for me,” said the Duke of Prague.
Mirka Topinkóvá-Knapková but did not walk in Snyk’s steps.
Fifty-five-year-old rider occupies fourth place in the semi-final today and is expected to start in the B final on Saturday and fight 7th to 12th.
They don't defend London's gold.
It was the first time I didn’t get to the final at the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I went to a high-quality race and put everything in it.
The rivals were just better, Topink Knapková leaned in front of them.
She fought until the end and believed that she would get into the elite six in her fourth game.
The fight gave up just before the target.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone could move out of the field.
I was surprised that the Chinese had such a finish.
And I thought I could move through Raku<0xC5><0xA1>anka to the final.
“Unfortunately, today was the life race,” she told the 2011 World Masters.
Far behind the finals in Rio remained young shooter Filip Nepegjal, who did not manage to get out of the qualifications, this time in the bed.
Nepegjal took the 33rd place.
The qualification was best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points from the first round, while Kirill Grigorjan scored 628.9 points from the second.
Nepegjal's shot was 620.5 points.
For the first time in Rio, athletes also spoke to the program, including Czech seven-timer Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachóvá and Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inová.
Cachów is 11th in the second discipline of the Olympic competition, Czech record-maker Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inová is 21st.
It is led by British actress Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters as well as the second-ever Belgian woman Nafissata Thiam.
They both managed to achieve the highest ever high-altitude performance in the seven-game series.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
If we look away from absurdity, the question posed is this: German society has undergone deep self-reflexion, whereas Russian society has not.
In both the great Eurasian nations, dictators emerged in the 20th century and came to power regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrible.
The Russian Bolsheviks from 1917 to 1989 contributed largely to the 94 million victims of communism listed in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted hunger, incompetent war leadership or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis have inhumanely wiped out about 6 million Jews, and the total victims of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and Soviets carried out monsters.
In Germany and the USSR there were not just a few individuals to blame, but a large part of the nation took part in these crimes, whether actively, passively, or simply by cowardice, or by putting their heads in the sand.
This is not only the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are equally guilty.
The denaciation of the Nuremberg Tribunal came to an immediate end in Germany.
But the most important thing came later.
As the children grew up, they began to ask, “Daddy, grandpa, why did you participate in such an asshole?”
How did you do that?
This brought real reflection and healing to the society.
Until recently, German elites have been mainly concerned with the prosperity of the country, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of its citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but it is definitely not about connecting Alsace-Lothringen or anyone - on the revenge - militaryly attacking - maybe everyone will recognize it.
After the loss of the Cold War, there was no great reflection in Russia.
The window of possible positive changes definitely closed at the turn of the millennium when former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often the criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
Putin's policy of Russia is revenge, conquering lost territories, humiliating the West.
The health, prosperity and future of our people are of no value to the believer.
Smite yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only through the decades of the despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally undervalued - predetermined to Asian (self) tyranny.
Who is benefiting from growing tensions around the Crimea?
The Ukrainian Army.
In recent days and hours, the situation at the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea has deteriorated.
Who is benefiting from the increase in tension?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia again deteriorated.
The plot of the Ukrainian side became the Crimea peninsula, which was attached to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from both sides are contradictory, and it is difficult to verify them independently, so we have only the opportunity to think about the old known question to whom does it benefit?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on the Crimea by the Ukrainian side, which Ukraine naturally rejects and on the contrary accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
On information about the detention of members of Ukrainian special forces in the territory of Russia, Savchenko's case has already received a known response that they were allegedly abducted in the territory of Russia.
If we were to go to the Ukrainian version, in what way would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around the Crimea?
The simple answer is: in nothing.
The escalation of tensions around the Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly by the West in the form of further sanctions and an intensification of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the past year, there has been a decline in attention from the situation in Ukraine against the background of the immigration crisis to Europe.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost credit to its residents, with the current support of President Poroshenko moving about 15%.
Ukraine’s economy would have long gone bankrupt without generous financial injections by the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime must once again strongly pay attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation before voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces want to show themselves again as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It is only to hope that all those who try to unleash an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only the soldiers, but all the ordinary people on both sides of the enemy and will not stop in time.
For the first time in eight months, Bulgaria has inflation.
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest in several years (since June 2012) and the first zero since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The average annual inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, thus a monthly inflation of 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 versus July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in the travel of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and ordinary maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level as last month.
The U.S. Secret Service has been tracking Russian hacking attacks for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks was made public last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the servers of the Democratic Party headquarters.
However, there is no official report on Russia’s involvement in the attack.
Moscow's share of the attack was denied.
The report on the tracking of the alleged Russian attack was highly classified, as it would reveal that U.S. intelligence services are monitoring the attack and could be revealed to be the way they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence agencies were reportedly involved in the attack.
New Advisory Board on Cybersecurity
The material on the Russian tracking was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Of the public figures, only a small group of eight leading members of Congress were informed, called the U.S. gang eight.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the presidents of both chambers Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of Congressional Defence and Security Committees.
Democratic Party chief Donna Brasile said on Thursday she was setting up a cybersecurity advisory board to “prevent future attacks and ensure first-class security of the Democratic Party’s servers.”
There was a dangerous parasite in Albert's ground salmon.
The chain apologized.
Based on the incentive of the consumer for health problems after the consumption of the food Losos wild used - pieces 100 g, consumption date 22.11.2016 carried out inspections by the Prague hygienists in the stores Albert on Wenceslas Square and Na M<0xC5><0xAF>stka.
The inspection found that the batch L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer noted is no longer available, and therefore the product of the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016 was removed.
The presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex was confirmed by laboratory tests.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and human-eating live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, <0xC5><0xA0>tija said.
We sincerely apologize to our customers for the problems with this brand product.
We immediately downloaded the aforementioned batch from the sale and for preventive reasons we also downloaded all other batches of this item.
There was a bug on the supplier side that we are dealing with, and at the same time we let this product test ourselves, Alberta Barbora Vanko told Newcomers.
If the customer has purchased this product, he can return it in any of the chain stores and get the money back.
Larvae destroy freezing and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - Vr<0xC5><0x88>ata.
Hygienists informed the Prague and Central Veterinary Administration of the occurrence of the hazardous product.
According to the server insecurityfood.cz people after eating the parasite can get anisakiosis, which manifests itself in severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can develop without symptoms, the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
Symptoms will appear an hour to two weeks after consuming insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, the larvae will usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, so they are killed either by sufficient heat processing of fish meat or by freezing it.
Veterinarians have also checked salmon at the recipient of imported goods in the Central Region.
Three of the five samples examined contained a parasite.
The shipment of 1,700 products arrived in the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Expedited, mostly to the Ahold chain, to date, there were 919 packages.
Currently, unsold stocks of the product are being downloaded from stores, <0xC4><0x8C>TK spokesman Petr Pegjal said on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples banned the shipment of other products from the warehouse.
A seventeen-year-old British woman wanted to flee Rakka, apparently killed by a Russian attack.
After initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to a jihadist, who was about to be killed, there was an outburst.
The expected caliphate paradise for British girls turned into a hell on earth from which there was no escape.
The girl, according to relatives, was in contact with her sister Halima.
She repeatedly called her to Britain and assured her that she wanted to go back home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have an order to shoot unintentionally, The Telegraph quotes the family lawyer of the deceased girl Tasnima Akunjee.
The last traces led to Rakka, from where the girl last called.
Then there was only a report of her death, which could not be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
They hoped to meet their ex-student again.
But Kadeza was probably killed before she could escape because the house she was staying in compared to the country in May, British ITV News reported.
The TV reported that the bomb was allegedly dropped by a Russian plane that attacked ISIS in Syria.
You would bring blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In a week when she was thinking about escaping from the Islamic State territory, one Rakushanka was captured in an attempt to escape and, according to available information, was publicly killed.
I think she interpreted it as a warning and decided not to take risks, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, went on their journey on February 17 last year.
At home, they just said they were going out.
However, they targeted Gatwick Airport and from it via Turkey in the territory controlled by IS.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in her power to get Kadiz back.
You'd bring blues from heaven just to get your baby out of a dangerous area and this family would do everything she could, pushing all the power to get her daughter home.
But this was not possible without risking being caught on their own, the lawyer added.
The only positive thing, he said, is that the fate of Kadiza could serve as a frightening case for other girls or even boys who are being haunted by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases where people have gone there, realised how things are going, understood how far it differs from the promises of the Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to return," Akunjee said.
The fate of the Kadiz comrades is unknown.
But since they have also been silent, their families must reconcile with the fact that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go behind bars without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the county center and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the mid-18th century, courts were held in the town hall and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the prisoners lived were sad, and many prisoners attempted to escape.
Many of them are also successful.
Therefore, the city officials decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more friendly to the prisoners, it had heating and gas lighting.
Either way, it was not in operation for a long time, it was closed for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, since the smaller repair facility was costly to operate and did not pay too much.
Stories of prisoners and ghost hunting.
For the public, the prison opened a whole century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different conditions prevailed in them.
Guides in contemporary costumes reinforce the authentic experience even more.
There is also a torture room where visitors can find out what forms of punishment were applied to the offender, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked in one of the customs, mostly because of a photo of the memorial, or to show the feeling that prisoners are experiencing behind bars.
In addition, Inveraray Prison is one of the most famous Scottish sites where it is reportedly scary.
There have already been several groups of paranormal activity hunters and the museum still allows people to come hunting some ghosts.
That night, however, will be spent on 300 pounds, which is about 9500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Anime" effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat app every day allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identity ways that limit absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that looks like a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any errors will be made public immediately.
Snapchat filters have earned criticism in the past with accusations that the app promotes blackfaceting or that it supports white skin shades as an ideal beauty.
So when this week she offered users a filter that made them have crooked eyes, curved teeth, and swollen faces, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowface."
And they were asked if these repeated controversial questions did not point to the larger problem of society - the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and news and anger quickly spread, and Snapchat said the next day that it had cancelled the function.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a manifestation of the anime characters account, not as an Asian cartoon.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded of painful stereotypes in action.
Others without the packaging have refused to compare with the anime.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about photographs was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "the least harmful and embarrassing."
She added that “it is difficult to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only on the yellow face, but that the yellow face is reached to the disgusting extremity.
Snapchat is not the only company that has exceeded these cultural boundaries.
It seems that American culture has in it an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from sitting rooms in corporations to Hollywood and the facilities we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diversified than their older partners — can mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some user,” Katie Zhuova, 25, said in an interview on Thursday, “it’s very difficult for these things to go unnoticed today as it used to be.”
Katie Zhuová, a product manager and designer working for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she was convinced that racially motivated issues reflected a lack of diversity in recruiting employees in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuova criticized the predominantly white, entirely male leadership of the company and ended the article with a hash tag: <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that they don’t have any diversity and color people among the employees at the moment they decide on these things,” said Zhuo, who is of Chinese-American origin, “or that’s where color people work, but not in positions to feel safe, or to come in.”
Other observers share her opinion – a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures relating to the diversity of its employees with the fact that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origins of its employees, but according to a spokesman, it recently accepted a recruiter who should focus on the under-represented population and the internal management of inclusion.
Zhuova adds, "I'm curious if they really need other such users who can say it's not okay," with their account being cancelled.
Military officers distort intelligence information about ISIS, says parliamentary committee
In a report released on Thursday, the parliamentary committee said U.S. Central Command officials had changed the intelligence services' reports to reflect a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the zebra they provided.
According to the preliminary report of the working group set up by the President of the Republican Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Service Committee and the Subcommittee for Defence, there was found "extensive dissatisfaction" between the analysts of the Central Intelligence Service, according to which they were based.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is a military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release reads, “The rises of intelligence intelligence services approved by senior officers to the Centcom usually offered a more positive picture of the U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than were confirmed by the facts on the ground, and were consistently, consistently, rather than positively, taken.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when a misanalyse is presented to the top policymakers," said Ken Calvert, a California congressman and Republican.
Failure to manage Centcom reaches the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the continuing problems of the central staff in describing and analyzing U.S. efforts in training Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no decisive evidence that the top representatives of the Obama administration ordered the reports to be amended, the report states that analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from the leaders of the Centcom to present a more optimistic view of the Isle of Man.
“In the first half of 2015, many central staff press releases, statements and congress statements were significantly more positive than what events were actually,” the report said.
For example, a spokesman for Centcom publicly stated that a major military attack on the takeover of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“This is completely clear after months of investigation,” said Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican party representative, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. Central Intelligence Staff’s top positions were manipulated by the outbreaks of intelligence staff in order to minimize the dangers of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group after they learned about the concerns of analysts that intelligence services related to ISIS are being manipulated.
After the report published on Thursday, further investigations must be followed by a more detailed investigation.
The intelligence services of Centcom are undergoing further investigations led by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the Republican working group’s findings.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process for evaluating information on ISIS and Iraqi security components,” said Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and Representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process "caused to overturn the outputs of the intelligence services," damaging the morale among analysts and "inadequately taking into account inconsistent opinions."
However, Schiff and Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House would try to pressure analysts at Centcom to adjust their findings according to “projects or political situations.”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported an ongoing investigation into the Pentagon inspector-general, which was launched following complaints from analysts at Centcom.
Commander-in-command Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the parliamentary report as the investigation of the inspector-general is still ongoing.
However, he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of comprehensive data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a sound dialogue on these key national security issues."
The investigation has an impact on the question of whether U.S.-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (a statement that is now declaring an increasing number of defense officials).
However, last year’s indictment raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to honestly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other places of crisis.
Critics of the Islamic State report have been reflecting conflicts for more than a decade, when intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that President George W. Bush's administration will re-in spite of the objections of many analysts in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in the fight against the Islamic State’s intelligence services.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker’s team reached the conclusion that, despite public declarations of the opposite, airstrikes conducted against Islamic State refineries did not significantly weaken the financial resources of this terrorist group, as the group scrambled to the ground.
The Times reported in September that the findings, however, were not transferred outside the central staff.
The commander of the Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to criticism a year after many legislators found the testimony of the Senate to be too positive for the war.
General Austin resigned in April, replacing General Joseph L. Votel in Centcom.
The U.S. won the fourth match in a row in ground hockey, so today will be a decisive match in the UK team.
Katie Bam in the game against Japan, which ended with a 6:1 win, shot three goals and just the day after for the American women's ground hockey team, she shot the first two goals in the game, in which America defeated India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two matches is a memorable success, but Bam (27) said she wasn’t sure if she ever succeeded.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those who write their books.
The Americans at the Olympic tournament lead to 4-0 games and share the first place in the group with the United Kingdom, which remained on Thursday after defeating Japan 2-0 remained undefeated.
The United Kingdom and the United States will clash on Saturday in the last first round match.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide which of the group of six teams will finish first and who will finish second.
The team from the first place will avoid the strong Danes, who are in the lead of the second group.
No matter how the game ends on Saturday, the Americans have sparked a surprise ride here four years after they ended up between the 12 teams at the games in London.
Bam was also in the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took ground hockey when she was 3 years old (her older twin sister played at Drexel) and joined the national team at the age of 16 and became his youngest player ever.
The 2008 Olympics ran away from her because she couldn't get to the finals.
Then came the year 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team did a lot of work.
The following year, he was appointed as coach by Englishman Craig Parnham and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the same pace of work in London as we do today.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam started in the first half by firing a nearby becken door.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bama took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then slammed into the middle and shot the ball into the goal to get the Americans to the lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the quarter-finals.
Jackie Briggs, an American goalkeeper who helped one goal in each of the three wins, was the first in the tournament.
She's in great shape.
Just like Bam's.
“We’re in a good place now,” Parnham said, but how good it is, it will depend on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympics
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is - it's an Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro, it is a persistent, indescribable and engaging shift of competitiveness and effort.
It’s like the Olympic march itself would be a hot staff stick, which is passed from a sniper to a swimmer, gymnast and triathlet.
You can’t turn on TV, read newspapers, or listen to your neighbor’s front-facing cafe interview without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the innocence between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming lover of women with dolls in their faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will be in households in the main broadcast time between the ad and the spots of sponsors, if he was a swimmer, a gymnast or even a gymnast.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
The Olympic fire will not light up all competitions equally.
Far from the middle, a bit in the shade are sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, bow shooting, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always be successful in the classic swimming style - and will most likely rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me warn you of the indistinguishable charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first introduced at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, the sport remains almost unnoticed – many people I’ve been questioning didn’t even know it was an Olympic sport.
It can be regional indifference.
The U.S. never won a medal in trampoline jumps, and until 2012, none of the athletes reached the finals.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But the trampoline jumps have yet another downside, partly because the ear of the uninitiated will appear to be more suited to the University of Clooney than to the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but just a passionate observer from the country.
It has comic potential - comic vibrations of infinite reflection - but also the delicacy of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines.
The word "trampolín" is derived from the Spanish word "el trampolín", which means "shopping board."
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline, which shoots them to a height of almost 10 meters and showcase sets of several elements (salt, heat and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to implementation, difficulty and "times in the air".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is ahead.
Warriors of the gold medal must go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, other times there and back, up and down.
He tries not only to reach the target band or the starting wall, but, as the TV news reports say, also another conceptual line: the world or Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatic – and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it’s also a bit exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on the trampoline in this regard brings relief.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upwards.
There is no sense in moving forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a weightless state as astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again without effort up.
Without competition and, of course, no difficulty, but for the duration of the assembly, no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no distance measurement, but only the perfect, neat stretching of time and gravity.
This is only the closest when the Olympics and Zen are approaching.
The women’s qualifying and finals are held on Friday afternoon, at 13:00 Eastern time, and the men’s competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the final in the afternoon block, which starts after both days at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments that you will probably overlook over the other battles.
And if attention is to be drawn only in such a way that male athletes will be the subject of loving views and materialization – as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by U.S. gymnasts – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to breathe.
"Protesting Generations" in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses claim that many protesters were shot during clashes with police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a firm Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has been plagued by anti-government unrest, which is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have stepped into the streets demanding fundamental political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s reaction was ruthless.
Witnesses claim that police have shot and killed gangs of unarmed protesters.
On rolling video footage of protests likely coming from late last year or early this year, security forces are captured as young people are thrown into holes after being forced to stand by the wall.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopia to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the region, especially in Somalia, and fewer African countries, if any, are getting such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has evolved at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved substantially - a new suburban train is even running in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, it is difficult to describe Ethiopia as a model of democracy - a human rights organization that is constantly talking about government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many of them have been confiscated, imprisoned, killed, or evacuated far into the desert.
But that can change.
“When you’re blackmailing people and they have no choice but to protest, there’s a breakdown,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All the young people are protesting.
It has been protesting for generations.
There are many complaints and they concern everything from land disputes to absolute control of the ruling coalition power.
Following last year’s widely criticised elections, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls it 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, pressure on the border with Eritrea is increasing, and the conflict along this imprecisely marked, controversial border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less oppressed over the past few years, such as the Roman Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit and rearm the confusion.
There are several factors that explain why now, after years of smoking under the surface, these bitter feelings have become hot again.
The first of these is seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks until the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of internet services has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as it usually happens especially during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered to protest.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oromi and Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromo and Amhars are not natural allies.
For a long time, the Amharians, mostly from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and trade and used the Oromas, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But it's changing too.
“We are on our way to a unified leadership,” said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Roma.
The biggest protests took place in the inhabited areas of Amhary and Oromia.
Many Amharic and Roma believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigris ethnic group, which make up about 6 percent of the population and controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the disturbance is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former leader of the insurgents, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to unspecified diseases.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly skilled in detecting the initial signals of dissatisfaction and used envoys to process opponents and win on his side.
“The current regime lacks basic knowledge,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was withdrawn from relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam came from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the Tiger-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be a further shedding of blood.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts described as elections that the government had robbed and then stolen.
It was followed by a tough strike, during which many protesters were killed — although fewer than in the past months — and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
The development experts appreciated Ethiopia’s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop this.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked business firms owned by the Tigers, and the harassment against the Tigers on social media became increasingly commonplace.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in an unpleasant situation.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently declared that the base has been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, at the same time does not want its ally to break up in such an unsteady region.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and the financing of ISIS as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump on Friday attempted to minimize the latest controversy that flooded his campaign by saying he didn’t mean it seriously when he repeatedly insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts in an unpleasant situation his supporters, who were striving to defend him in a stormy time, and must explain that he may not have taken his remarks seriously.
Following this proposal at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in the interviews that he did not really intend to say that the President and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in a post on Twitter on Friday morning, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of an old one-day statement when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump ease the remark by reminding that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes as Trump tries to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in election polls are declining.
Trump and Clinton took part in the Michigan Duel on Economic Issues this week.
On Friday, Trump attempted to return to the subject.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton’s proposals were linked to tax increases, and said that her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defenses before.
At the end of July, when he gathered a wave of criticism, when he spoke with a proposal that the Russians should penetrate Clinton’s emails, his remark later explained the words: “Of course I’m sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and adjust them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing, to what extent some messages have a response from his supporters to find out how they react, and then, in one way or another, “send an explanation,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who tracked the language, using both of them.
But I also think it is inverted in its statements and knows that they are hesitant enough to be able to explain it differently.
As the results of the election polls continue to decline in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more scathing tone in recent days, rather than focusing things on general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is largely behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump tries to avoid apologizing for the provocative statements he says, but often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But along with Trump’s growing attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have brought his loyal supporters into an unpleasant situation that must stand behind him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor who is one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he says is a legitimate political comment,” Giuliani said, questioning the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization, which he mistakenly called a novice, and it was because he had withdrawn his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton acted as Secretary of State, has allowed ISIS to flourish and is unable to handle the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before Friday’s meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to tweet about himself on the media for exaggerating every word he spoke and being obsessed with him.
He laughed at the “poor, pathetic” television scholars trying to understand it, and said, “They can’t do it!”
Several Democrats have apologised to Trump that this is just another proof that he is not eligible for the presidential office.
The coffee shop has been pushed out of the market. Now it's back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a fancy place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee was served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the windows of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells soaps in the form of cakes.
The locals lamented it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is drained and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, then it is also a rediscovery.
The Resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees are working there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good, too.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original cafe, who is also the owner and CEO of the new location.
In Verb it began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered him to pay the transfer to a new location, he said he would do it with pleasure.
Rodriguez, 36, left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same espresso machine model.
He even re-used the illumination from the old Verbe.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started to use new ingredients.
Sandwiches with ham, eggs and cheese and toppings, such as capers and roasted onions, are on offer.
You will also find brown rice bowls here.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a constant influx of original stamp guests.
“Many of the original customers also had to evacuate from Williamsburg because of the prices,” he said.
Last Sunday, there was one of those clients, Rebecca Oliveira.
Mrs. Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and frequented the Verb Cafe.
It happened even when the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she completely stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verb,” she said.
Now he's drinking coffee again, but on that day instead of his usual ice-cream he gave a mixed chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been loyal to Verb since 2003.
They go to work and always order the same thing.
“At 4:00 a.m. and 8 p.m., I come here every day like a clock, and they’re already making my dough with everything and butter for me,” he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the offer.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what is usual, but sometimes he lets everything on his dough with bacon, eggs and ham.
Rodriguez said he did not regret that the soap shop had taken his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the café as an additive.
“I think we could still use it,” Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also welcomed the coffee shop.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to show it soon so that his new neighbors would feel at home here.
The new place has other advantages.
The local producer of fruit juices wants to stack in bottles and sell filtered coffee.
There is an opportunity for the cafe to expand into the neighboring building.
A lot of customers just want to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the cafe reopens, getting in and having coffee is like coming home.
“I missed the smell,” he said.
Depressive food from the time of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the office of President in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat at the Oval Office and ate lunch.
President Roosevelt’s bartender enjoyed selected dishes from 5th Avenue, such as a doughnut from thick jays and a Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for this day was more modest: diabolical eggs in paradise sauce, potato purée and as a dessert swamp pudding.
“It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to Americans how to eat.”
The couple, who lives in Brooklyn Heights, is dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe's latest book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of a residential house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during the great economic crisis.
They themselves showed culinary solidarity and met with the reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg sandwich shop, a small buffet in the Flatiron neighborhood, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) gave her crocana, potato chips and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carbanate, which the couple said was well suited to a conversation about food during the crisis.
“The Karbanatas were very popular,” said Ms. Siegelman.
He was selling berries, liver and bean carbants.
They were made from the mixture and other inexpensive foods that set the ingredients.
Imagine the amount of beans you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe slipped.
“They would lie in your stomach like lead,” he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of food you eat.
Women's teams cooked for farm workers and served freshly baked cake for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during the First World War. “A Square Meal” watches how the nation coped with the fact that it was not suddenly a land of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods, such as carnations and foods from roasts, roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roasted roas.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - after many years the central point of American cuisine - has become a savings-allocated luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were supposed to serve as a calorie and nutritional filling, preferred taste or even common sense when cooking.
During the surveys for the book containing the recipes, Ms. Siegelman prepared a meal of the time from a baked onion filled with berries butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to the dinner table,” said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman said: “It was surreal.”
Buraco butter with roasted onions does not go together.
It was typical for a lot of homemade recipes.
So, like never before and never after, domestic economists - including Louise Stanley, the sheriff of the Federal Office for the Domestic Economy in 1923 to 1943 - guided the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take over the burdens of the budget, and turned lights such as cream spaghetti with carrots into tasty foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical tombs.
The government’s response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s posture, was to “give me a cake.”
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmer's kitchen of his childhood, he ate as a selected millionaire he became.
“He liked to eat continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce,” said Andrew Coe.
He ate in a room with a smoky face.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably make the same mistakes if his wife Eleanor hadn’t allowed him to follow the example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Mrs. Roosevelt rented a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all. This led to the White House “not only serving almost the finest food in all of Washington, but also prepared in the most unpleasant way.”
A number of eating habits emerged from the crisis as the country re-established itself.
The link remained in our constant study of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they better understood the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman’s mother—perhaps why she couldn’t throw away food.
“She had a real fear of wasting food,” said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman recalled, “It was bad for people from her.”
There was an accident with the wrinkles.
When Eisenberg’s tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert that they prepared at home: a candy dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“He’s called a peanut cream,” Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes an elegant name.
There was no cream, just slices, some flour, sugar, water, and cabbage.
Everyone unwittingly threw a spoon into a dense brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as the right farmer, he said to his wife, "There would be a little bit of cutters."

Most of the refugees who migrate to Europe come for economic reasons.

Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of legal representation costs in the case of a patent against type C jaundice against Merck Group
The District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of the fees for lawyers incurred in its patent proceedings against type C jaundice against Merck & Co Inc.’s drug manufacturer.
In June, a ruling that Gilead was supposed to pay <0x24>200 million for damages for infringement of Merck's two patents in connection with Gilead's highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, was annulled after the federal judge found out that the other company was being imprisoned by the federal judge and was repeatedly prosecuted.
Federal judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a file on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to pardon fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the next-generation drug market against type C jaundice, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of the drug from Gilead.
US-backed military units claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbij
U.S.-backed military units gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now haunting the city after the departure of the rest of the group of radicals hiding in the city.
The units have freed over 2,000 civilians who were detained by radicals, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF Alliance and the Manbij military council told Reuters.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still looking at it,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned <0x24>10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax return, stating that the presidential candidate for Democrats and her husband had <0x24>10.75 million in income in the year and a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton was donated <0x24>1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Ex-President Bill Clinton contributed nearly <0x24>5.3 million in fees to the joint cashier for lectures, and former foreign ministers pledged a pledge of <0x24>3 million for admission.
Clinton's co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Caine of Virginia and his wife, Anne Holton, have issued a tax return in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are still a model of financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton campaign.
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and is renouncing his earlier promises to make his tax returns public.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not enforce them.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited an audit of the U.S. Treasury Department as a reason for his refusal to publish a tax confession.
“Your move,” campaign supporter Hillary Clinton tweeted, advocating for the Democratic candidate’s tax return.
Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish tax returns until the audits are over.
According to Trump’s critics, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, his rejection raises questions about his net profit, charitable contributions, business transactions, and various other relations in Russia.
Clinton has made a strong stand on the issue, and on Friday she released a video in which she recalls how high the Republican position on Trump is pressing for her tax returns to be published.
On Thursday, he will address the issue in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have done for decades – publishing their tax returns,” she said.
The organization Politico said Trump had paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times cited a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim that this could be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the presidential election.
Clinton is enforcing a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that everyone who earns more than <0x24>1 million a year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet at a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also went through an IRS audit and that Trump was “not afraid” of the financial office, but of the voters.
Clinton’s campaign published tax returns back to 2007.
Clinton, who now lives in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent.
According to Clinton’s 2015 tax returns, unlike most Americans, their earnings are only <0x24>100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton was given income on dividends and interest of <0x24>109,000.

Condoms filled with chili or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservatives in Tanzania use a non-orthodox way to prevent elephants from entering human habitations – they throw condoms filled with chili powder on them.
This process has been proven and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American ecological organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, using this non-violent process in their four-legged, non-violent ways to protect themselves.
Many of them had used copies to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since the development of this ... set of tools, we’ve seen a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said Damian Bell, CEO of Honeyguide Foundation.
The first and second step is to illuminate the passing elephant with a battery and start the clash.
If they don’t tell her, she will throw out the so-called “chilli cloud”.
Chilli powder mixed with salt is packed together with the petarda in a condom, its end is locked so that only a knot looks from it.
After ignition, the condom explodes and a fine chili powder is sprayed into the air.
Usually one flap is enough and the elephant is going in a different direction.
The last option is to ignite a firearm, which will cause a loud, bright explosion.
A Jewish filmmaker crawled to a Berlin hotel for deleting a code to call Israel at the Arabs' request - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish descent sparked media riots after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to an employee based on a “demand” by Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary “Shoah”, vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in a list of hotel calling codes.
The state, however, was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
Written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Hotel Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility of making calls to Israel via its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation, and with a problem turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lanzmann, according to his words, “shocked.”
The hotel staff responded that the measure was "decided after considering the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The director’s reason for this move was even more confused.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have been asked to delete Israel's calling code," Lanzmann said in a letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the case as "a great shame".
We were frightened and shocked by the events.
It's a huge shame in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and, moreover, in such a hotel chain is even more embarrassing.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” he said.
The event triggered a strong online reaction, people labeled it scandalous.
Some believe that the hotel Kempinski simply "lost" in the demands of Arab customers.
“Hanba you,” says another post, indicating that the hotel, which is located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street, stands near the synagogue.
According to the newspaper Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly took any charges by calling the event a "revision" and "an apology" to Lanzman.
“There has never been a direct order” not to include Israel in the call codes list, the Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted Kempinski as saying.
Adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesting Brazilian students
A clash between students and police took place in Brazil’s San Paulo on Thursday, when students gathered to protest against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against the protesters.
The problem escalated as government law enforcement attempted to separate students, which resulted in the use of rubber projectiles and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
San Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin’s proposals to save money include closing nearly a hundred public schools and relocating 300,000 students.
Some of the protesters could be seen splashing inscriptions against interim President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes just a few days after protesters crowded out into the streets in support of imprisoned President Dilma Rousseff when the Senate in the country decided to sue her.
Trade between Russia and Iran rises by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryana, after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran, trade turnover increased by 70.9 per cent over the year.
As the ambassador said, since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached <0x24>856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and reached <0x24>697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to <0x24>158 million.
The sharp increase in trade was ensured by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, a Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly travelling.
For the first time, Iran has been ranked among the top 20 countries by the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
“It can be safely said that the record number of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be exceeded,” he said.
At the same time, however, a relatively small number of Russians are visiting Iran, and the ambassador hopes that there will be a change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition,” he said.
Skot Callum Skinner rushes home after Brits get gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the Hall of Fame in a men's team sprint on the cycling drum in Rio last night when the VB trio defended the title from London in 2012.
The Thirty-three-year-old from Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took for his Scot Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man enjoyed the legend as he reached the goal and stole the victory from the hand of the favored New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago, and Hoy won a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing modest sixth at the World Championships in Rail Cycling in March, even though Hoy ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for Jamie Staff’s specialized starter.
The hinds arrived just in time.
After Hoye left, the place was also released, which he attempted to fill with Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes, who was a champion four years ago with Hoy, and Skinner reached an Olympic record in qualifying, but the shirt took over New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind after his wheel, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, when Hindes went to a higher transfer to slow down and allowed Kenny and Skinner, in part, to keep pace.
Today's race was watched from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes performed on stage, he didn't turn his eyes off them.
Thirty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said, “It’s a likable comparison.”
I am here to make the best of myself and to honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win it.
After triumphing alongside Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had fallen on track after a weak start.
The remark later withdrew and the British opponents had no opportunity to appeal.
This time around this victory, there was no such problem.
Hindes said, "With all those British flags on the tribunes, I felt like in London."
In the last three months, we've all been sunk like a team.
We have lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It’s one event, one gold medal for the nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then there are five successful days waiting for us on the cycling trail.
With the form presented by Kenny, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy’s success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
It would then be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy - also have a birthday on March 23 (this date seems to be sacred to British sport, this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a total of six gold and one honeymoon.
No matter how much he got Hoy.
As a follow-up, Kenny will participate in a sprint that starts today and will last another three days.
An eighty-year-old from Bolton said, “I’m enjoying this one right now.
The team race is always the best.
You win along with the others.
To be honest, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knight's title."
It was the only medal race that day, but Britain was still awaiting further good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the four-kilometre race.
End of time 3:51.943.
The world record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:51,659.
The first round and finals (22:42) take place on today’s second day of the race, which the insurer will focus on Wiggins.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he debated with the Commissioner when the referees called on him to measure the height.
In a similar women's race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shando, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record with a time of 4:13,260.
The VB team relied on its strong team of track cycling and controlled the mid-term of the Olympic Games and won many medals.
After really exceptional performances, demonstrating absolute prevalence in Beijing and London, during preparations for Rio, expectations declined.
Dramatic events, including the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April on charges of sexism and discrimination, and the cessation of the careers of giants such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of cycling races, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team is able to deliver top performance with perfect timing could be re-established.
The uncertain future of the Portland tavern after the termination of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminum mill in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that the company supplies electricity and which informed the intention of one of the owners of the mill of the contract on the supply of electricity. will terminate the mills of all the mills.
This move comes after the government of Victoria earlier this year decided not to extend the provision of subsidies that the company maintains.
The 20-year fixed grant expires in November.
Alcoa Portland has up to 2,000 jobs at risk.
With the closure, up to 2,000 jobs - directly or indirectly - may be endangered.
And since the factory consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity, there may be further avalanche impacts.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry Camp in 2014, which resulted in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland tavern is on average and threatens to close.
This move follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices for the production of the plant.
AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects some of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority of the plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, small business shares held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the high demand for electricity from the barrel will continue,” she said.
The AGL said the contracts were the so-called "insurance contracts", which were to enter into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
“AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to profits for fiscal year 2017,” the power plant said.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits from fiscal year 2018 onwards is currently limited due to strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written the value of <0x24>187 million in contracts according to its accounting records “in the event of termination.”
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contract “does not affect its ... ability to operate the campsite or secure the supply of electricity to the campsite.”
The company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect from November this year, although it still has to explain why it resigned.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland tavern in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL chief operating officer Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in market demand [electricity].
It would not be good for us as a producer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of Kardashian's real estate TV show - now it's the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, the model and fourth daughter of Kris Kardashian-Jenner's clan mother-manager, appeared on the September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador Estee Lauder, who presented the news at the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this title page,” Kendall wrote.
The opening of the title page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of the humorous in Kardashian's presentation?) scenic video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the baroque robbers and Caitly's puppets and together with them, they can make a tayreicka, they're all the producer's favorite uncle upsucky R.
It’s the embroidered storyline of almost every “birthday” of a children’s TV show (Seacrest says, “Did you think we forgot about you?” with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o’clock in the morning), but Kris might need to make sure the audience is ready for it.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we certainly entered the new era of Kardashian.
Elder sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the Vogue envelope (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The Vogue magazine is the best-selling issue of the year.
The edition, which with its thickness resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a whole range of advertisers (the Fashionista calculated that out of 832 pages in last year’s edition there were 615 pages of advertising content).
The discovery of the star, which will appear on the title page, is unexpectedly expected, so it’s no wonder that in the last two years the magazine’s photographs have escaped even before its official publication.
Among the women who appeared on the envelope in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, more “celebrities who make models” have appeared on the title page than “models who are celebrities.”
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar holder and Dior ambassador, appeared on the title page in 2013, a year later she had the honour of Lake Gaga.
But while it is very unlikely that Kendall — which the magazine describes as the “broadway model” of her generation — will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, nor the stars of real estate shows, or children of today who know how to make a well-dressed video (even when Jenner represents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the title page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner’s success.
Her role in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them "daughters of the moment".
These feelings were rekindled with the news that Jenner would appear on the Vogue envelope.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
Presents for Mark Jacobs.
He sells you make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her free time she works on a reality show, perhaps just as one way to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community Legal Aid Centres Reject 160,000 People Annually
Every year, more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are denied legal assistance in community centres and the sector itself is preparing for the impact that will have further restrictions on the financial resources for already overloaded services.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly seniors, immigrants, endangered workers, victims of violence, and people without the funds to fight unfair expulsion and the like – are refusing to do so right away and without help.
Community legal services, which are already so strained to crack, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centres will lose an additional 30 percent of the federal funds.
James Farrell, director of community legal aid centers in Queensland, said that according to a recent summary report by the National Association of community legal aid centers, 5,000 people have been found to be rejected each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without cancelling the federal government's decision, the situation would worsen.
"Community law centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who escaped from relationships with the rapist, people with excessive and protective debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly released – all these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting help.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, leading to thousands of more endangered people from Queensland having to face complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Queensland Attorney General and Senator George Brandis to immediately prevent this financial cut to get people the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
Over the past year, the state government has been committed to ensuring the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal assistance centres and the community of their clients and the Palaszcz government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign lawsuit after a member of staff allegedly targeted a gun
NEW YORK: Donald Trump’s campaign has been sued for alleged inaction after they were told that the North Carolina Operations Director targeted a gun on a staff member during a jeep ride in February.
The incident was described in a court record that was handed over to the state court in Charlotte on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign software trainer in the state.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he came to the conclusion that “it won’t happen.”
Director Earl Phillip “marked the gun’s fingers, put a real trigger pointer, and pointed the head to Vincent on the cheek,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
According to the report, Bordini, after complaining to the local and regional leadership of the campaign, found that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
“The guns don’t have to be fired to cause damage,” Bordini said in the suit.
The lawsuit comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked an upheaval when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners and gunholders could intervene (which is edited in the second amendment of the Constitution in the United States) if his opponent's C cannons are out of control.
Trump’s campaign says his words are out of context and that Trump has not defended the violence.
Bordini in the suit seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, illegal use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news agency in the city of Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one responded to the call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services within a short time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain Needs to Spread the Olympic Spirit and Expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just as it was in London in 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to benefit from the Olympics.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to both the Startford and the East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities, we will create 10,000 new teaching jobs, 40,000 new jobs, and end the unemployment of young people in the vicinity of the airport.
Just like before the 2012 London Olympics, there are those who will think Heathrow’s expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympics and that we will be laughing on the world stage.
The suspects were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow it turns out they were wrong.
There will always be a need to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, increase the economy by <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion, leave the legacy in the form of skills and jobs, both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We at Heathrow have a great team that has introduced an infrastructure investment program for <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion, starting with the T5 terminal - which was chosen as the best terminal in the world for five years in a row, after the T2 terminal that was built among the two busiest in the world.
They are now ready to deliver a third wound, worth <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a huge success for the UK and I am convinced that Heathrow will be expanded as well.
It’s time to further spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure trade for the future, and leave behind a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy for Trade Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in a game on cat and mouse in ad blocking
Attempts to bypass advertising-blocking programs have turned into a game of cat and mouse for companies that make money on online marketing. At least one of the companies that program such software claims that.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site that states that users can update the filters in their program and re-enter ads.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website would change the encoding around ads to make it easier for ad filters to find out which parts of the page are ads.
Adblock, however, now claims that the new codes have already expired.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between an open source ad blocking community and those trying to circumvent it has been taking place since ad blocking was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another custom fix.
The fact that the company owned the world’s largest social network was involved in the war only proves how big the problem of blocking ads for the industry has become.
According to the study, Pagefair conducted last year and Adobe uses advertising filters around 200 million people worldwide – almost four times as many as it did in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of the revenue from Facebook ads, with Facebook visiting 1.03 billion active users every day from mobile devices.
The spokesman said the company is going against ad filters on desktops, as mobile ad filters on mobile apps for social networks and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on desktops still represents a profit high enough that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook said on Tuesday it would update its “ad preferences” tool to give people better control of how ads are displayed.
Facebook said on Thursday that new Adblock filters were worrying them because they could also block content that isn’t related to the ad.
“It’s not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesman said in an email statement.
Blocking ads is an insensitive tool, which is why we prefer to focus on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give people control.
A car crashed on a Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for evidence of an incident in which on Thursday morning, several cars were hit by a woman who was likely trying to commit suicide on the highway.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the actress was lying in the dark on the road and was hit by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interrogated, but according to police, not all have yet been identified. The police are calling on these drivers and all others who have witnessed the accident to sign up.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a “logical” step in a situation like this, Gilles Hofstetter, a lawyer, told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to find out if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the collision?
The prosecutor must find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases from the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking along the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as newspapers said.
Last year, a police officer was dismissed for negligence after she crashed into and killed a man lying on A1 near Paynere in the night of August 2014.
In court, the 22-year-old victim had been drinking alcohol and stunned on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - acted in a reasonable manner and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident that occurred at Morges should register to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agencies (A<0xC4><0x8C>CKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
This was announced on Friday by A<0xC4><0x8C>CKA Executive Director Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Pet<0xC5><0x99>i<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
The sixth Prague Pride season began on August 8, the festival brings the lives of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people (LGBT) closer to life.
Approximately 35,000 people took part in the event last year.
"Praga is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized companies," Pet<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC4><0x8D>ková said.
According to the organizers’ survey, overseas visitors to the festival spend an average of 3,100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are provided with a special map of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clients are very lucrative, they are interested in staying in higher price relationships with a high standard of travel services and spending more than others," Pet<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC4><0x8D>ková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium will be held this year.
It is attended by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the US and China.
The festival will continue until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the action will also focus on several thematic areas, such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be a traditional guided tour with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letna on Saturday.
This year’s milestone, attended by thousands of people, commemorates the silence of the victims of the June nightclub in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat celebrate 40 years.
The irresistible kittens Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have been entertained by small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening series by director Lubomír Bene<0xC5><0xA1> premiered on August 12, 1976.
After the creation of this animated series, now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries around the world, the jokes of the artist and director Lubomír Bene<0xC5><0xA1>, who invented for the magazine with two kittens by Mr. Ouholí<0xC4><0x8D>ek and Sedlec, were drawn.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> then invited the co-operation of the playwright Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Kubí<0xC4><0x8D> and the artist Vladimír Jiránk and together they created the film Kutjaci.
Today’s shape with yellow and red knitting and balls and radio were given to the characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak TV began to be created in the short film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then given in 1985, this time it was directed directly for the Short Film of Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Bene<0xC5><0xA1> founded his own animated film studio AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of whom Bene<0xC5><0xA1>'s son Marek participated.
Currently, there are over 90 episodes of the stories of these cucumbers, with which everything slips under their hands, but never gets angry and they are always full of optimism, ideas and Cucumber enthusiasm and finally they are satisfied with their work, which proves a well-known gesture.
Pat and Mat even moved from television screens to books, DVDs and theaters, and other toys featuring Pat and Mat are the hit of every toy.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two years of harmony.
The weekend is a fairy tale, we have chosen for you one sports and one of life.
Both have a good ending.
Well, let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
What are the things people spend the most on at airports?
This is a Friday's review of the world's websites.
First medal of the Olympic Games.
The island state of Fiji celebrates its historic success.
This island's rugby team defeated the British rugby team in the final of the seven-point Olympic tournament.
This is the first medal Fiji has ever won at the Olympics.
Waiting for the gains of the first precious metal took sixty years from the launch of the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
The coach of Fiji is a great success.
It's ironic that it's Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the finals as a British citizen could have been satisfied unlike its nationals.
"Let's play freely and lightly and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history," he said before the final.
Fiji eventually ruled it sovereignly and a small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The report was published by the French newspaper Le Monde.
A new friend and good luck for the little girl.
2-year-old Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without her arms and legs for 11 months, has had a new girlfriend.
A doll who looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," a two-year-old girl said to ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her arms and legs and then sits together without prosthesis.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis in less than a year of life, with doctors only giving it a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she never gives up.
If you see it.
I saw her introduce herself to the other children with the words "Hello, I'm Harmonie and I don't have hands."
Look at the joy of the doll.
How much do we spend at the airport?
CNN reports that people at airports are spending the most on bottled water.
Hudson's travel essential stores has released data for the last year, summarizing the 10 products that customers buy most at their airport stores.
The water was the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, with eight of them in the first ten.
The ninth place was a large pack of M&M candy with a coconut flavor.
And can you guess who's closing the first ten?
As one of the above, you can’t eat.
According to CNN, it is the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: The New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
The magazines include US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.

We're just going to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
Riders Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have ruled the category of doubles without a chairman for seven years and have also confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
At first glance, the unsurprising couple switched to a smaller crew after the Olympics in Beijing and has been ravaging competition since 2009.
In the Rodrigo de Freitase Lagoon, they scored the 69th consecutive win in the final on Thursday.
What are we different from the others?
“We’re just more beautiful,” Murray jokingly said during the Olympic regatta, when he had to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand couple.
Honestly, we don’t do anything different from others.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy," Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is remarkable also because they are physically different.
Murray is a nearly two-meter and stoky chassis, academically looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
In addition, they also have a different nature.
Bond is studying and investing in finance, Murray has a charitable boxing match, for example.
They don’t spend too much time together outside of spending.
Eric's basically getting into the ship with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I have a tendency to think about what can break down, Bond admitted, who even at a press conference showed that Murray is dominant in the crew.
He was always the first to answer, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
In the water, however, he destroys the opponent with calm force.
They take their pace, and although often still not in the middle of the tracks at the forefront, the opponents have not yet found a prescription for their gradual acceleration.
We race on a two-kilometre track and we never wanted to go the first kilometre in a row.
We're just trying to go at a pace no one else can.
“We know what we have to do to win,” Murray, 40, said.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both were members of the Golden Four without a chairman.
Just after an unexpected failure, the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later decided to move on to a double without a chairman.
At the Olympics in London, the biggest defeat of their careers was probably won and the dominants confirmed in Rio.
London was very intensive.
We did everything the coach told us and didn’t ask for anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally good at it, Murray said.
We know that we all want to get rid of the throne.
We still have the target on our backs.
We’re trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA’s Climate Model: Venus Was Once Inhabitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for studying Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions similar to those on Earth could once prevail on Venus, whose surface is hot, water-free and saturated with CO2.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rotational speed of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, it seems that Venus once was able to take pride in a rare Earth-like atmosphere while turning slowly.
The model also deals with the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet was probably dryer than the Earth, but once there was enough water and geographic diversity to control life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to use the sun, which was 30 percent darker.
“In the simulation of the GISS Venus model, it exposes its daily side to the sun in a slow rotation for almost two months at a time,” explains GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This is how the surface heats up and creates rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that behave like a umbrella and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is climates with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than they are currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus-like evolution, which was previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over the course of billions of years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and water vapors were burned with ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped, and only a dense carbon dioxide atmosphere with a deadly greenhouse gas effect -- that's Venus as we know it today.
Researchers have published their findings on the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy Resigns as Colorado Avalanche Coach
Patrick Roy resigned from his position as coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche operations team on Thursday as a reason for his inability to participate in the decision-making process on the team's issues.
Colorado Executive Vice President/General Manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have been the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
Over the years, I have long and intensely thought about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations are in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the team’s performance.
These conditions are not currently met at the moment.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
“Patrick informed me of his decision today,” Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best coach of the league during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He scored 112 points and placed first in the Central Division, but Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of play-offs, and during the last two years he did not have any games after the season.
The Avalanche team in the 2015/2016 season scored 39:39:4 and missed five points to get the second wild card in the Western Conference.
Roy, who signed to the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on the North Sea oil platform resume talks and suspend strike
The top representatives of the negotiating parties said the strikes on salaries for the oil platform workers in the North Sea were interrupted, while all the parties to the dispute had come to a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group have occasionally taken place on the North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process of resolving current disagreements,” the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from a new angle.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30% in protest against wage cuts.
This year, Wood Group lowered rates and paid its North Sea suppliers about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the rates of companies comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would provide the company with room to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell has scrapped thousands of people from its payments and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries due to modernization of its processes – immediately after a mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain’s June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish lawmaker Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest workplace accidents of a generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the economy in the region.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for all, not just for some,” he said in a statement.
In comparison, in 2016, almost <0x24>1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years was around <0x24>7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of the stars in Pleiades
The Kepler Space Telescope’s latest mission to help astronomers is to obtain a nearly complete list of rotational speeds of stars from the constellation of Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the constellation rotate at different speeds, as well as how the time of rotation is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars, we will learn more about the relationship between star mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Center’s Anafracess and Prosa’s Caltech Center.
The constellation of Pleiades is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood and formed over 125 million years ago.
Now it turns fastest.
In moments of maximum rotational speeds, these teenage stars release huge amounts of star wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation slows down as well.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of spots on the stars -- similar to solar spots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebellion compares stars to dancers, making pyruets bigger slower than smaller ones.
“In the Pleiades, we see that the slower-turning stars are more massive, while the fastest-turning ones are usually very light stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Plejad cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
“Playades provide an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars,” Rebull said.
There’s still a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their speed of rotation and, so to speak, “hang their dance boots on the nail.”
Rebull and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the speed of the Plejad rotation in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a Qualification Agreement Necessary?
If I did not apply, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could move to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without enrolling in a specialised education?
It is to me that in the field I would like to work in, there is now a job vacancy only in a slightly more remote hospital, but in about half a year there might be a job vacancy in another place where I would then like to work.
I don’t know how to deal with the situation for about half a year, the question continues.
According to Ms. Lenka Vlova.
No legislation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the reimbursement of the expenses incurred by increasing or deepening the qualification of the employee.
In the field of health care, there is a long-term pressure to not conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the mobility of health workers at work, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for the acquisition and recognition of professional qualifications and specialized qualifications for the performance of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, while expressly applying that participation in the specialised education is considered to be a qualification.
This means that the qualification agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs reach at least CZK 75,000.
There is no legal requirement to enroll in a specialised education.
The law only lays down the conditions for applying for specialisation in the field of education.
However, under the law, a doctor is authorized to exercise the profession of a doctor already through the completion of the necessary higher education, even under the conditions laid down by law (under the supervision of a doctor with specialized qualifications in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation in which professional practice completed in another field of specialisation may be included in the specialised training of a doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant training programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the keyboard's situation.
However, given that I do not know the circumstances of this case, consultation with the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (the department of science and medical professions) may be recommended, since the Ministry of Health provides advice and consulting services from the law relating to the special education and training.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from Syria’s Halab are asking for US intervention.
The United States did not make any effort to end the siege (insurgency parts of the city by government troops) and did not exploit its influence in enforcing the protection of civilians, AFP quoted a letter to the White House.
“We don’t need tears, compassion, and even prayers; but desperately we need to create a flightless zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab won’t be surrounded again,” he said.
Russian forces, which support the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that as of today, they will stop strikes in the Halab region for three hours every day to allow safe passage to humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 AM to 12:00 AM all military activities, air strikes and artillery fire are to be stopped.
United Nations humanitarian operations chief Stephen O'Brien welcomed this, but stressed the need for at least two days of ceasefire.
According to AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors operating in the eastern part of Halab have already been controlled by the rebels.
During the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world is watching and noticing how complex Syria is, but doing little to protect us.
Recent proposals to evacuate residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly concealed threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors said.
Doctors said that in the past month, there have been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria, 15 of them on the hospitals in which they are working.
The saddest thing is that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
Young children with such serious injuries come to us to the emergency room, so we have to choose from those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the material we need to help them, the doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns were suffocated when the explosion interrupted the oxygen supply to their incubators.
They leaped after their breath and then their life ended—before they could really start, they recalled.
The army, loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has in recent weeks surrounded the rebels in the controlled eastern part of Halab, with more than 200,000 people without food supplies inside.
Rebels, who are under continuous strikes by the Russian and Syrian air forces, managed to break the siege after three weeks on Saturday and launch an anti-offensive.
Both sides then added reinforcements in the city and its surroundings.
