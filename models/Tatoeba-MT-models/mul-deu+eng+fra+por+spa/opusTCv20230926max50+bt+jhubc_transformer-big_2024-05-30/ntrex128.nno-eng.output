Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid of not being taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently frightened over a proposal to change names from assembly member or AM (member of the assembly) to member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they can be ridiculed.
A Labour member said his group is concerned about your "MWP rimar on Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means fool and "pwp" means fool.
A member of the Plaid party said the group was "not naked" and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said his group has an "open mind" when it comes to the name change, but added that MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is not pronounced unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, now writing bills to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on what members of the National Assembly will be named will of course be up to the members themselves."
A Welsh official decision from 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the draft names demonstrating great support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of Members of the National Assembly, the delegation preferred Welsh Member of Parliament or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
Members of the National Assembly have reportedly come up with other proposals, but the struggle to become one has given the head of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main work. It is expected to submit the bill in a few weeks.
The legislative enactment of the reforms includes other changes to the way the delegation is to function as well, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will be able to vote on what to call them when debating the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The people's eviction was decided to resolve a conflict that has been going on for many decades with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbor in the north represents a claim on the territory and has had many objections against Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the popular dismissal of the name change, said he will look away from the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's clocks are still as churches in Harlem, New York, struggle
"The old ones I've talked to said that in old days there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
“Today there are no parts.”
He said he understood why the bars disappeared.
"People are socializing in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Just are no longer stoves in the neighborhood that people visit as usual."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling properties will not last as long as the leaders believe, "and sooner or later they are back where they started."
He added that churches can be replaced by shareholdings filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic sites in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of those who buy shareholdings in these buildings are white," he said. "and thus the day comes when all the churches are closed, because it is not likely that these people who move into the shareholdings will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built of white socks before Harlem became a black neighborhood – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's church a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black sock that had preached in the vicinity moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black sock led by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shops at 125th Street, a main trade in Harlem where the owners were opposed to adding or promoting blacks.
The building suffered major damage in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and successor to St. Martin, was proud and called the clock game "the clocks of the poor."
The expert playing the clock game in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first clock game in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play on the larger clock game of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has become a complicated tale of architects and construction workers, one of them added by the leaders of the play people in the church, and the other by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, which leads the socket and consists of the leaders of the lay people, wrote to the bishopric in July with concerns that the bishopric "would ask the sacristy to pay," even though the sacristy was not involved in the bishopric's addition of architects and construction workers.
Some of the members of the socket have complained about the lack of openness from the diocese.
13-Year-Old Injured by Shark During Scuba diving in California
Bildigheiter reports that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for hummus in California on the opening day of the hummus season.
Taken her just before 7 in the morning near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented to KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dive with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help. He fell down to the boy with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought only the boy was excited to have caught a humm, before realizing that the boy shouted "no beat me!
“Someone beat me!”
"His entire collarbone was torn off," Hammel said that he observed as he reached the boy.
"I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was picked up by air ambulance and taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's unclear what kind of shark it was like attacking the boy.
Bathing guard Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious injuries to the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most are not believed to be dangerous.
Shop chain Sainsbury's bets on beauty product
The British store chain Sainsbury's is to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' beauty products and offer grocery store intensities in the store.
As part of an investment in the UK's beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as the fashion and interior hall drops, Sainsbury's testing their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and several stores if it becomes a success.
Investment in beauty products comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they will double the number of beauty products to 3000 products and offer brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They should give the labels L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each label such as in the Boots boots.
The store will also relaunch its own makeup series Boutique and make most of its products vegan, which will attract more young customers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test the salon of its fragrances in two of Sainsbury's bags. The first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food every day from local small stores means that large store chains must find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing director at Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like a grocery store, while the store chains are trying to fight the low-priced stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has merged with the Argos interior chain in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims that this has increased the food supply room and thus defended the acquisition.
The store chain's previous attempts to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments were not a success.
Sainsbury's collaborated with Boots in the early 2000s, but this ended when the parties were not agreed on how to share the profits from pharmacies in stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold pharmacy chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmacies and owned the pharmacy chain Lloyds, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and will offer an extended luxury range of leather products, including the La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how the beauty shelves will look and experience to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also assigned colleagues with special expertise to be able to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and the convenient locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of acting."
Peter Jones "crazy" after Holly Willoghby resigned from deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
The star of the TV show Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is "crazy" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement with his <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to promote their interior and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of the This Morning, 37, announced the news on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the stars of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, amid the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "crazy" when the golden Holly confessed during an energetic meeting on Tuesday at Jones' headquarters of Marlow, Buckinghamshire's business, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - means she no longer has time to collaborate on interior and decoration.
The collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that she was not going to work with True, while Jones escaped the UK to calm down in one of her holiday homes.
A source said, "Truly was definitely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one believed their own ears on Tuesday, True was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the decision to host This Morning, which is one of the richest stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to heavy product investments, from pillows to candles to clothes and interiors, and could cause delays with the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand True together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman of the board in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S and is set to replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's program I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We are not commenting on his business."
Difficult conversations “and so we fell in love”
He ridiculed the criticism he came to get from the media to come up with a comment some could experience as "unprecedented" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his silly voice as a "news buzzer".
"I haven't given up anything."
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting following their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the downturn of North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
But the negotiations on the nuclear weapons program have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN's General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a "corresponding response" from the United States citing North Korea's early downgrade.
Instead, he added, the United States continued with sanctions to pressure North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's going great between us and North Korea," he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results - the end of rocket testing, aid for the release of hostages, and the return of the remains to U.S. soldiers.
He defended his unusual approach when it came to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing to the group standing in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroys island and kills hundreds
Following the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organizations were notified that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's residents had to flee, no one declared a national emergency, which is necessary to obtain international emergency assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they do not want international help, so it is a bit challenging," said Sumbung.
While Retd Barna assembled a team to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain whether employees with foreign passports are allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the Indonesian National Crisis Agency, said that authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to offer emergency assistance.
Although Indonesia is subjected to earthquakes often, the country is not particularly prevalent for the forces of nature.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunami in Palu, there was no alarm, most likely leading to more casualties.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship lying on sail in Lombok to treat those injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration of President Joko, and next year there will be elections again.
President Joko is also under pressure when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets and used maquettes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge won the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal while the position was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before kicking him up and towards the goal.
The attempt sailed high above the penalty field and faucet towards the upper right corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball falls over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into goal.
"I was just trying to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew players like Shaq were trying to get as far as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and lose the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball."
Chelsea leased 1-0 after the break after scoring in the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Before the goal, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before scoring near the midfield and into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly took the ball to the midfield.
Then he shot it in a wonderful way and leased Hazard into the criminal field.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defense and scored with the left foot just past goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Number of victims in Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The number of casualties in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, the country's emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, such as her on Friday and had a force of 7.5 followed by 6-metre-high waves, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the emergency agency, reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.
British police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after woman became the knife piece to death
A murder investigation has begun after a woman was found killed in Birkenhead, Merseyside today early.
The 44-year-old woman was found the knife piece at 07:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street, while a 32-year-old man is arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have requested tips on the incident from local residents.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is still in an early stage, but I ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also urge everyone, including taxi drivers, who can catch something on the dashboard camera, to contact us in case they have important information."
A police officer has confirmed that the woman found is from Birkenhead, and that she was found in a home.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have come to the area to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and police have stated that they are in the process of informing the family of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his own apartment, but has been told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He didn't know what to say when he found out what had happened.
The villagers have been told that they are not allowed to enter their apartments for many hours.
Someone heard a police officer say to a man that the entire area is a place.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She wins over and over again "it's so terrible".
At 14:00, two police cars inside the police gang and another police car outside the gang could be seen.
A crowd of policemen stood within the police gang and observed a block of apartments.
If anyone has any information they can send DM to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling <0x2B>44 (0) 800 555 111 with the reference "log 247 from September 30".
Cromwell's Parliamentary Statue Becomes Last Victim of "Rewriting History"
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England as did his Puritan followers during the 19th century civil war.
But the Cromwell Association described Crick's proposal to remove the statue as "twisting" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said, "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a goal.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was briefly ordered or performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell would be the victim of the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's outstanding representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 19th century, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still think it's worth celebrating."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, seen as a defender of parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was of course against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not is still a topic of discussion in historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-18th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual we know represented one side of that distinction.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembered."
Murdergris Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, named Yuan, was found dead, with cut heartbeats and covered with blood, near a pigtail at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give pigs vaccines on a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his cousin dead, discovering that the gate to one of the pig straps was open.
He said that in the bone there was a large male skull with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and damaged," his cousin, named Wu, told Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera shows that Yuan came to the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while the police collected evidence on the incident.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Although it is rare, such attacks from pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, causing the man serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig kept a Welsh farmer trapped between him and a tractor, until his wife frightened the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became the food of his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
"They just want to play.
They like to bite a little, they are curious ... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa Brings Rain to Southwest USA
As predicted in the weather report, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker over the cool water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring rainfall to northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had wind power up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 05:00 in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean moving east to the west coast of the United States. Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous flames and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will lead to rainfall between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the southwestern United States, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous flumes can occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It warns against hiking in the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
Rain can turn clamps into flammable rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust.
The upcoming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total precipitation of more than 1 centimeter is possible, which can create small flames and smooth roads.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Spreading tropical rain towns will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain increases late on Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October may witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic is getting colder, but tropical stretches will still be quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start in October, with 25 degrees and upwards from the southern part of the large plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term warning indicates that there are high chances of over average temperatures in the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million view Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, the political discussion around the case continued, with interruptions in the usual television programs of various broadcasting companies to reveal the latest news on Friday: a consensus reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the charges over the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was commanding her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during an emotional interview, that he is 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the poll on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company reached this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The speech was not clear from other channels showing the poll, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, there is a similar number of viewers looking at an American football final or the Oscar award.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with the most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was second-placed by 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested in hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, who is a moderate Republican, declared that he is on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants shouted after him on his way to a hearing with a jury committee on Friday.
He stood and watched in the ground for several minutes as the Protestants silenced him on CNN live.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to our country?"
Some said to him, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office has spoken out, and before entering the elevator he said that he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The broadcasting agency showed the hearing on television when the judge's committee was to vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to the full Senate and further voting.
But Flake said he could only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against Kavanaugh over the next week, which Democrats have also demanded.
Flake was partially overjoyed after talking to his friend, Democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking with the Coons and several other senators thereafter, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May blames critics for "playing politics" when it comes to Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, blames critics of her plans to leave the EU for "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom without regard to national interests, in an interview with The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party's conference on September 29, 2018.
Alongside the interview with May on the front page of the Sunday Times, an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson is being held, in which he is going to attack the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's taxes is "whole absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting in U.S.: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned for deliberate murder, police say in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between the Sims and Simpson, and police said the Sims lost their glasses during the battle.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.
After interviewing Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set at <0x24>350,000, reports the local newspaper The Advocate.
The colonel of eastern Baton Rouge released an early autopsy report on Friday showing that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
The Baton Rouge Police thank the Louisiana State Police Special Forces, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local residents for helping them find Simpson.
The athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being "watchful in achieving justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2-metre-high basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 rebounds per game the previous season.
Friday morning LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "comfortless" after Wayde was killed.
"That's something we're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano blasts ash over Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Crisis Prevention asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after activity increased in the crater and center recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumblings and earthquakes.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash on cars in various neighborhoods in Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists within jubilee for self-proclaimed rhetoric
Six protesters were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrators for self-defence clashed with police forces, and thousands of other protesters protested against self-defence one year after the vote on possible release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder lacquers that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The riot also broke out later in the day, and police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours, the separatists shouted "Don't forget, don't forgive" while the Protestants shouted against self-governing, "Long Live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries after the protests.
The mood is still pressed in the region and many will still have their own one year after the October 1 vote, which was called illegal by Madrid, but was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voted in favor of the self-governing, but there was also low electoral participation among those who were against the self-governing and boycotted votes.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the voting and electoral riots from occurring in the region.
Groups who were too independent slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
However, the demonstration went off the stack, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests along with his wife, said he no longer has hopes of independence in Catalonia.
"Last year we experienced one of our bestowal moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy to be able to voice for themselves, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections earlier in December, the Catalan parties are too independent to hold power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or detention while awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the popular rhetoric and the ensuing self-determination.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on her phone, said the conflict was haunted by police on both sides.
"The voltage is increasing more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been part of ongoing trials since last year, announced that he will run for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backlash of democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.
Londonderry, Northern Ireland: Men arrested for accidental car crash into house

The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the car caused damage to the entrance gate and the building itself.
An armrest may have been used to shoot the car.
Many Scots Give Livingston 1-0 win over the Rangers in Scottish Football
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston secures says
Recorded Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his second say after 18 games coaching for the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menge's shot turned out to make the difference while Gary Holt's side matched Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no losers in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and is due to play against the Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has six consecutive wins, and head coach Holt has still not lost since he replaced Kenny Miler the previous month.
Livingston misses chances against the missing team
Holt's team should have hired long before they scored, creating more problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low stakes on goal, causing Alan Lithgow to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play ahead of them, knowing that they could create trouble for the away team.
And that's how the decisive goal was scored.
Rangers agreed to a free kick and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scored from the middle of the penalty field.
By then, the Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score but was stopped by the Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow flicked long after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passings were sent back and forth into the Livingston penalty area, while two penalties - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one for hands - were blown away.
'Fenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont and Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal match and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played amazingly and still impresses the basket up.
Their playing and player style has barely changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks goes to Holt for the way he has shocked the team since he became coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, organizing a defense at the military level, while Menge distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the match.
Rangers, on the contrary, were not motivated.
However as good as they have been under Gerrard, they weren't good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, cutting only half home once, which should make Rangers realize they don't get up anymore.
Erdogan welcomes to Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under the blue sky when they met for breakfast on Saturday, September 29 in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is hoped to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries have been unified in terms of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque for "security reasons," but many of Erdogan's supporters showed up to see his president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of the Kurds - also appeared to condemn Erdogan's policy and the German state's decision to welcome him into the country.
The dueling Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who view Erdogan as a hero, and others, who view him as an autocrat.
Car accident in Deptford, London: cyclist died after collision with car
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a London car.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast London, at 10:15 local time.
The driver stopped and ambulance personnel arrived quickly, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred just a few months after another cyclist died when the driver fled in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometres from today's accident.
London police reported that they are identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have to run around the area, while other drivers have been encouraged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison in England: Six guards injured in riots
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a high-security prison for men, the prison office in England says.
Ongoing unrest broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special "Tornado" forces are retrieved to calm down the uprising, involving eight prisoners in a separate part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor injuries to the face.
A prison official said, "Specially trained guards should calm down the ongoing uprising in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate elections in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in jail longer."
There are more than 500 people in the HMP Long Lartin, including any of the most dangerous criminals in the UK.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated for injuries, after a prisoner went on strike.
And in October last year, special forces had to come to the prison to calm down a serious uprising, where prisoners threw billiard bullets at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flames (in favor of drought)
Tropical low pressures are rare in Arizona, but it is precisely such a weather phenomenon that is on its way to Arizona early next week, in which the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move southwest across the desert and create fear of embarrassment.
The national weather service has issued warnings against flames on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south-eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and may already give rain late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that "only ten tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometers within the Arizona boundary."
The latest models from the national hurricane center report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can count between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the southwestern drought, including central parts of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated total amounts up to 10 centimeters.
For areas outside of flame risk, the rain from Rosa can be a blessing in the drying.
Although flue is a serious concern, this rainfall will likely benefit areas in the southwestern United States that are exposed to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, extreme drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest category of drought, reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa moves across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With winds of over 135 kilometres per hour on Sunday morning, Rosa is 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm force, Monday afternoon or evening.
There will be a lot of rainfall in parts of Mexico, which may increase the risk of flooding.
"Rain between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 centimeters," reported weather.com.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull further up through Arizona and into southern Utah Tuesday evening.
"The biggest danger with Rosa or the remains of this, is a lot of rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the American southwestern drought," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening flames in desert areas and countryside in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton, England: Four Arrested for Murder Attempt
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of murder after a 16-year-old was found the knife piece in Somerset, England.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04:00 on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police reported.
The police have urged people who may have mobile footage of what happened, to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered" under what "bad and angry" Democrats were against him
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and ruthless tactics of the Democrats," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered" under what "bad and angry" Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's charges of sexually assaulting her several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her debts during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people were able to see how brilliant and courageous" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice of one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, a lawyer with flawless public service," he told a crowd of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the midterm elections in the United States.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't ask, but I really ask," he said.
"That's why I'm traveling around to fight for good candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are looking to "resist and block."
The first important vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of killed increases
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them caught by huge waves on beaches, while a severe earthquake and a tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to attend a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters high, struck the beach at sunset, taking many people while destroying everything they came across.
The tsunami came after an earthquake with a force of 7.5.
"When the warning of the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not leave at once and thus they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's crisis change agency BNPB, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami was not enough in itself, he brought with him cars, tree trunks, houses; he hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed up into trees to avoid the tsunami and survived in that way.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photo from the air published by the emergency agency shows many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquake could be observed in the surrounding area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Technology Testing and Testing Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the atomic bomb over Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the injuries as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the deceased have been found during the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and the size of the destructions may be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communication is cut," Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said waves came within the timeframe that was notified.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building screaming desperately to people down the streets to warn them of the upcoming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hit the coast, bringing with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video at first.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages and cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate emergency relief.
The military has begun the process of dispatching cargo flights with emergency assistance from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities report, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
It was planned that President Joko Widodo would visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have safely arrived in Palu city, and have set up tents in the backyard of their office. On their way to the city they passed the total area, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
While emergency aid organizations are starting work to help those affected by the tsunami, some have complained that foreign emergency workers with expertise in crisis management have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organizations and their associates cannot start work until Indonesia has declared the area to be a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's a crisis at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the state says 'OK, this is a national crisis,' we can open for international emergency, but they have not updated the status yet."
It is evening left in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those still missing still hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not plan to end well.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had doctors trapped next to her deceased mother for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man named Mandagi said that any of the people caught in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon said he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the paragliders from Palu, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after hearing that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only a gray hook, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think that means the messages didn't come up," he said.
Thieves steal <0x24>26,750 from a minibank in Newport, Levee, United States
On Friday, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's employee in what he was about to fill up a minibank in Newport, Levee, United States, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The worker had just emptied a minibank in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the press release.
While the worker was busy, "a man jumped up behind the worker" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects as they fled the scene, according to the press release, but the police were unable to determine the number of people involved in the theft.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "The creation formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came just before he was to perform on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show after she cancelled due to "emotional reasons," the program host said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,''" West said earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The name has changed from Kanye, meaning the only one, to only Ye - to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are.”
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also changed the spelling style of the name with and without strings and capital letters.
Future President of Mexico Promises Not to Send Military Against Civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged never to send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at peaceful protesters and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening more free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Investment in Artificial Intelligence
Since China is more actively working with artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investments in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government spoke about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
A doubling in funding could double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month via publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Managing Director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked player of the game Othello, and later he worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was the chairman of Google in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions organized by the U.S. state, such as the "Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked how long the next competition will be, so he will be with and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China taking the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding university students to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
"I think doctoral students in artificial intelligence should get automatic residence permits," he said.
The Chinese Council of Ministers published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Federation of Natural Sciences finances students at academic institutions, not unlike the U.S. National Science Association and other government organizations' way of allocating money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of a committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of <0x24>2 billion in an initiative called AI (Artificial Intelligence) Next.
The National Science Federation invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no legislation on national security and artificial intelligence has been working for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether they should change their names to the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighbor in the north represents a claim on their territory, and has used a veto to vote against membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change could undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott has sown doubts as to how far the referendum will reach at least the 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the referendum site is: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership and agreeing to the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth EU and NATO membership. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although voting is not binding according to the law, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said that they will follow the result of the voting to make her decide.
In order for the name change to take place, Parliament needs two-thirds inclusion.
The state election committee reported that nothing unusual had happened by 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voted, as opposed to 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters voted.
"I speak for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko spoke in Strumika in the Macedonian people's eviction for whether to change their names and open to join NATO and the EU on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the popular eviction in front of the Skopje Parliament, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not for changing the name of our country," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has said NATO membership will attract investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
"I believe that the majority will vote for the change, out of your 80 percent of our citizens will become members of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "status fixation of our future."
A poll earlier Monday by Macedonia's Institute of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is below the required number.
Another poll by the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to close, at least 50 percent must vote, plus one vote.
If the referendum does not close, it could damage the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through the Brighton Defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling destroyed the Brighton defense leading to a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculous easy, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine tip received a pass on the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He crashed past three Brighton defense players and reached open run.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He turned around one defender, before leaping past several others on the edge of the Brighton Penalty Field.
He passed a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English tip used his first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot right into the right end of the goal.
"Aguero still wore his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about how he could play for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave the sky blue the first advantage in the Premier League match.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep inside the Brighton Territory.
He kicked the ball beautifully along the left end of Leroy Sane's path.
Sane held the ball while leasing Sterling to the goal.
The sky blue tip kicked the ball into the goal just before he slipped out of the track.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer to play spoilers against the Rockies in American baseball
With the Nationals eliminated from "playoff contention", there wasn't much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high competitive instinct, hoping to take the "moon" on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to a "playoff" for the Rockies, who lead with one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies won at least 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but look forward to locking up the first division title.
"Although we don't play for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team most likely to play at the highest level so far this year.
Who wouldn't want to play with such a relationship?"
It is still unclear who will start at the Nationals on Sunday, but Scherzer may have to "pitch".
Scherzer, who then starts for the 34th time, throws a "bullpen session" on Thursday and is supposed to "pitch" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 "strikeouts" in 220 2/3 "innings" this season.
Trump to gather voters in West Virginia
The president briefly referred to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about how important it was for Republicans to vote in the midterm elections in the United States.
“Everything we’ve done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not asking, but I'm running around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it's happening right now.
And they are convinced that they will definitely take back power, you see how terrible they are, how evil they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run against to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "oppose and block."
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "sin and evil and ugly and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who made his audience bow.
“Do you hear her answer?
Were you the one who leaked documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They are intolerant to those who say what they think
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was not surprising.
After all, I'm the last in a series of Labour MPs who have been told that I'm not welcome - just to say what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it came to how important it is to run responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar themes that Jeremy ironically disagreed with former leaders.
In the call for the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it was stated "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
In my last eight years as Labour MP, Friday's meeting has been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like that, and the promise of "smaller" politics has long been forgotten, if at all it was followed.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that each opinion is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a party leader, when colleagues I used to agree politically with suddenly expected me to change my mind and agree on things I would never agree on - whether it was national security or the EU internal market.
When I speak in public it has nothing to say what I say, I always get quiet on social media and people want me to go away while they criticize central politics and say that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get gender-discriminatory and racist shikans targeted every day, and who are still professional and don't give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of time is how normal it has become to harass policemen.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should be more tolerant.
In the red circle, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. For every mistrust proposal and for every change in party rules, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I have received a lot of advice over the past two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I enrolled in Labour, when I was still going to school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was about to collapse, so I would have better public services for those who need them most - if it was then minister or government council.
I have never concealed my political views, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in doubt about what I stand for and which of the current leaders I disagree with.
To those who voted for Friday's proposal I can only say that when the country crashes into a Brexit that will harm private, local businesses and public services, then I do not understand why people care to waste energy on questioning my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But in fact, then the only message I have is not the right to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the constituency, whether they are Labour voters or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no one can get me off or change my policy and prevent me from serving you in the way I think everyone is best for you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top in Scottish rugby
Two late "tries" may have changed the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr was hoping to win this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership game today.
They are now on top of the pallet as the only invincible team of a total of ten.
It was their sovereign defense and ability to take chances that gave the home team and their coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be content.
"We have been tested in recent games, and we are still invincible, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr deserves praise, they were better than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a "try" in the 14th minute, when Frazier Climo tried a "conversion," which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes of the Warriors allowed Melrose to gather, and Jason Baggot took a "unconverted try."
Climo received a penalty just before the break, he scored and "converted" a "solo try" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which was "converted" by Baggot, reduced the slinging world by five points.
A long pause occurred when Ruaridh Knott was severely injured and put on the beard, and from the restart, Ayr fauk forward through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, which Climo "converted."
The working captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, was given a yellow card, and again Melrose tried a "unconverted Bruce Colvine try," at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball from the penalty shootout, MacPherson scored a "try."
Climo "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's "box kick" and sent "flanker" Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth "try."
The star of the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant industry
Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, appears ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays alongside partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it seems Kiernan is planning the life of Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The scooter will not comment on the case, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper has hinted that Kiernan would be involved in the "progressive restaurant industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes court will open waterway to the Pacific
Seglers patrol Marine Headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right
and the duty to return to it.”
In landlocked Bolivia, people can still remember a coastline the country lost to Chile, in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict. They long to seal in the Pacific again.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades while Bolivia is awaiting the verdict of the International Court of Justice to come on October 1, after five years of territory.
"Bolivia has drive, peace of mind and is united, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians come to see the verdict of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Court of The Hague supports Bolivia's claim, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - gives Bolivia an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who strives to be re-elected next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
"Now we will be returning to the Pacific soon," he promised in late August.
But some analysts don't think the court will allow Bolivia to gain access to the sea - and that little would have changed even if they had access.
The Netherlands-based UN Court of Justice has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that they will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
The court's verdict comes only six months after the last negotiations, indicating that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
For the past four years, Bolivia's case has far from advanced, they have done the opposite.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales, with his quarrelsome rhetoric, has killed what was left of Chile's goodwill, said Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that his court decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile" and a chance to "set up 139 years of inequality and rather benefit both," he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win votes.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"Judgement is an opportunity to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't abolish nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation can't be the first to abolish, if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to follow up on the pledge they gave during the Singapore meeting between the US and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when the United States' foreign minister, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to re-start its fixed nuclear-weapon diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will submit if the United States continues with sanctions and opposes a possible declaration of the end of the Korean War.
Washington vetoes to agree to a possible declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolishing first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical of Pyongyang's seriousness in terms of settlement and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris Shows Massive Headwear Is The Latest Fashion On The Road To A Shopping Street Near You
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you don't need to search anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a series of large and special headwear in their SS19 collection. The headwear surprised the public during fashion week in Paris.
Highly impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was an opulent, beige Valentino hat with a poultry-like, at brakes covering the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories were also found during the fashion show, including a jeweled watermelon, a wizard hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks - just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were sewn together and resembled more to Hannibal Lecter than high couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice cream in cookies.
If you like this hugely dramatic fashion, you can just enjoy it.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats come for sale in a shopping mall near you.
The oversized hats come just after "La Bomba", the beam hat with the 60 centimeters wide beam that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent out a new creation on the catwalk – a stranded beach bag of the same size as the bikini-dressed model that wore her.
The beach bag, with the color of burnt orange and fringes topped with a white leather handle, was the most attractive part of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection during fashion week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the fashion boxes next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt that the demand for oversized accessories can be ignored."
John Edward: Global Citizens Need Language Skills
Private schools in Scotland are known to lie at a high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with outstanding exam results, only enhanced by individual and joint success in sports, arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are working to offer the best services to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, career pathways, and roles as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular choices in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the exam results from this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest grades for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took foreign languages received A.
The data, collected from SCIS' 74 member schools, shows that 72 per cent of students received A in mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who took German, 69 per cent of those who took French, and 63 per cent of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital attributes, which children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Languages as electives are considered equivalent to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering studies and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Selection for Addition and Properties showed that 17 percent of employers fail to fill positions due to lack of language skills among applicants.
Therefore, language in school is increasingly important in preparing the youth for work.
With multiple job opportunities for linguists, these qualities are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of what kind of career a youth chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a proper advantage in the future with such a trait.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any language other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Being able to multiple languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different when it comes to the language they teach.
Many schools focus on the classical modern languages, while others teach in languages classified as important in the UK as we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will prepare children and provide the qualities they need to close, regardless of what the future brings.
One cannot deny that in this global, business-oriented environment, languages are vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called "international communication properties."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, thus offering diversity and high competence for Scotland's youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting for fans to watch LeBron James debut on the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-season game on Sunday, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long he will play has not been decided yet.
"It's going to be more than one minute and less than 49," Walton announced on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, doubted that James most likely would play for a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a storm of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five planned stops next week, including stops at friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending to choose to fill the Supreme Court's vacancy position, Trump aims to build up support for upcoming midterm elections since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are due in November.
What time is Trump going to be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to be held at 19:00 tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely record this week's hearings of Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about allegations of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmed vote from the Senate waiting for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this caffeine of collections is to help the Republicans meet the November elections and get some momentum (movement).
Thus, President Trump's campaign says that these five gatherings next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters that Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season," said a Trump campaign spokesman who refused to be informed to Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening's collection may bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows belly for fight to keep hope alive on the singles on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions Saturday afternoon foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup in.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sporting scope, but one that players really believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say that the moment is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now there are four, so we take it as a little moment, I suppose," said Jordan Spieth as he walked off the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points leading with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in their sailings, and they have a lot to encourage from, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and hunting for examples.
The guttural screams of the celebration became higher as his round continued, seeking an important putt to take match four all-squao.re as he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt that won the match at 15, was met with a similar scream, the type that tells you that he thinks the American team is not out of this.
"You've actually only got to dig deep and worry about your own struggle," Spieh said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but cute couple are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine hopped on an 18-hole track) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaging audience, cement that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European say when the sun sets over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Talking about European honor is still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work of Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine, rough Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never came close to climbing out.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between opponents, advice they give, and advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change at a glance.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taking a significant lead into the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the belly of the game that anyone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take his match so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side ordered to retain the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a flawed American side in tomorrow's fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes and won two games, but they could not recover the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a striking weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four games in the Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs, they went so great to beat an outspoken Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more sought after 5 and 4.
Woods, who slipped through two games on Saturday, showed occasional brilliantness, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning's fourballs, returned to partners Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe still didn't get everything they wanted on a pleasant, blown day southwest of Paris.
Three times major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the reference to the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 say over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes as they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point base and entered into singles, although as holders Furyk's side only needs to draw to retain the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, however, it seems like a Sunday fashion attack will be outside of them.
North Korea says it's not about speaking down unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that if sanctions continue, the distrust of the United States will increase, and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told at the annual general assembly of world governments that North Korea had taken "significant measures" to improve conditions over the past year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and promised not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear physics technology.
"However, we don't get anything similar back from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has lodged several complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase" approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be paid for taking gradual steps, his deception showed itself significantly by not rejecting unilateral nuclear decomposition, as has been done by Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint withdrawal printed by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for "deconstruction of nuclear power on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted talks to ease harsh international sanctions in North Korea.
"The US insists on "deconstruction of nuclear power first" and increases pressure with sanctions to achieve its purpose of coercion, and they even opposed "the declaration of ending peace," Ri said.
"Belief that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that as the sanctions continue, our mistrust will only increase."
Ri did not mention anything about plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. president highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, for the past five months and added, "If the party in this encouragement to the downgrading of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the downgrading on the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean missiles against the U.S. mainland, after malice President Trump called Kim a rocketman on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year believed in "totally destroying" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still needed to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place until North Korea unravels its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN's Security Council on Thursday that, "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be maintained vigorously and without fail until we get the complete, final, verified disarmament of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to poison funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemns him for coming up with "gangster-like demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also an atomic complex if the United States did "similar measures."
He said that Kim had told him that the "similar measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump enacted in Singapore, and steps toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has contributed to all students getting more sleep, in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture that goes into studying caffeine all night. That is, you use caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
An academic found that students at top universities are often careless when it comes to the most basic - how to take care of yourself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are I being told this now, in adulthood?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping - something that surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students got severely poorer sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, it is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campuses, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it won't change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride over drowning still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even avoiding gaining weight, since sleep deprivation sees the brain in swelling mode and makes them constantly swollen.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, having been a student with him the previous year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to press on to get a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before starting the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, and which can convert the inner clock to something like total trouble, such as before.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Many goals give Gerrards men down
Rangers went on a new defeat on the run when Dolly Menge's post sent Steven Gerrard's uncovered page to a 1–0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take their first win away since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a leader, giving eight points, a round under Ladbroke's leader of the Premier League , Hearts.
Many beat to seven minutes before halftime, and a Ranger show with lack of inspiration never seemed to be to match.
While the Rangers now fall down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and lies just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be additional problems in stock for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury, after an object was apparently thrown from the outside.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that broke Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt , on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot the previous week, and he would have been enthused by the way his well-drained outfit took the quiver on his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have had the ball the most , but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored after only two minutes when Mengea's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his giant chance.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the return insert.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hopeful than believing in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morello knew he would have had a penalty of 20 metres when he and Steven Lawless collided, but judge Steven Thomson pointed away his wish to the Colombian.
The Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the player's rules, no one can deny that they anticipated it just because of the "shot".
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep death ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher beat the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool to pick Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard allowed in the break as if he exchanged Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange caused an immediate effect when the wing player made a hole for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed forward to block.
However, Livingstone continued to overlist the guest team to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending out long shots on long shots.
Holt's team could have increased their lease at the end, but McGregor succeeded in preventing Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow made a long post from the corner mark.
Ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new penalty claim when he supported along with Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
Almanack: The Inventor of the Geiger Teller
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE REKNAR ... the day when he who was to become the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific bear beam since then, the Geiger plate also became a bear beam in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the seemingly unlikely cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger plate, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you look at these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atom coming from the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: “Yes, don’t bubble it!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that asks for his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" red cells.
New cancer vaccine can teach immune system to "see" red cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, and changing them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common in many cancers, and then reinject
A sample vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced ovarian cancer disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinitiate the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how they target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West commissioned a Pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAGA lue, after he hosted the TV show Saturday Night Live. .
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was dumped in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an inconvenient achievement in which he praised U.S. President, Donald Trump, and said he would stand for election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great caps, he gave Democrats a draw and repeated his support to Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white person, and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a number along with comedian Matt Damon, where Hollywood stars mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate jury on the allegations of sexual assault from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the recording of West's draw was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with the post.
Vest had also complained to the public that he had the difficult backstage because of his headdress.
“They mobbed me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They're freaking me out!
And then they say I'm in a drowning place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Would you like to see the drowning space?", saying that he would "take on the superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love.”
His comments led to outpiping at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassingly affected, Variety reported, with a person telling the publication: "The whole studio was deadly."
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her former lover, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner tweeting: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STAYING UP TO THE PIECE."
But talkshow host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "simply was just who he is and it's absolutely amazing."
"But I did NOT choose to pay anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his 'art') that I believe embraces and spits out ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
“We are too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medappar, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the last musician Prince, changing the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington goes against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-spelling role as Jon Snow in HBO's electoral medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has gone out against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often cause young boys to feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thinks something has gone wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "too strong" to address the problem.
"Personally, I am convinced that something has gone wrong with the masculinity," he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that TV is partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very male characters.
He continued: 'What is born and what is being taught?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets, what makes young boys feel that they must be this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones predecessors or sequels when the series ends this summer, saying he is "end of battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a re-recording of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The scooter recently revealed that he is watching the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so that way it gave me my future family and my life forward," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the nominated for Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health claims say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ persons is claimed to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have found that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add lacquer information from the GOP senator, it explodes into 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waers on Saturday condemned allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were pedalized by "extreme right-wing" surveys and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more contemptuous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of the American Sens. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing of the charges of sexual assault against Supreme Court elector Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released the information to a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is totally false and an absolute lie," continues Waters.
"One of my associates - who has got their identity, personal information, and security compromised as a result of these inappropriate and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's response was quickly criticized online, among other things by former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is blamed for something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
They don't have to be tough.
They must not question the motives of the debtor.
They must be quiet and peaceful."
Fleischer proved to be comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being apparently too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to take Water's place in the midfield election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified "the proper government and law-enforcement units of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are disclosed," she continues, "and that they will be held legally liable for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my employees."
Johnny English hits again - spy thumb of weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit landmarks in all new films with a British angle, and it seems applicable to this revival of Johnny England's action comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-vironic satire about how open we are, become the new export possibility in the country?
In any case, the great, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber trick has for the second time renewed his permission to fuck things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic book creator for cinema audiences in non-English-speaking countries.
He is of course the stupid, secret agent who despite his bizarre desires to spread a bit of glamour has gotten a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of the guy contributing with a simple melody to the Fire Cars, theme during the 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony in London.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two fine moments in this last JE excursion.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor suit while the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of physical comedy is on the screen, but the humor feels quite weak and strangely redundant, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humour felt as if it was directed towards children instead of adults, and for me Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replicable cloth in the person of Bean.
The permanent current assumption now is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's supersecret web network of spies, which reveals the identities of all UK agents have in the area, to horror for the agent at work - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last stray of a prime minister who is a pompous and warlike figure, who already has a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is not so much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once each active spy has been charged, she must bring in someone who is retired.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at a somewhat elegant establishment , but provides unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of nice jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type academy for espionage.
English is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moved to a submarine job, an over-enthusiastic role where Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things terribly crazy in Her Majesty's Secret Services is back too full in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the charm of the charismatic technology billionaire, claiming that he can solve Britain's computer problem: the terrifying Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of father-like wild games: disguised as waitresses, set them on fire at a nice French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggling themselves on board Volta's wishboat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make it known.
All stops are certainly drawn to the last sequence, but as loving and undisciplined as it is, there are quite a lot of children's TV throughout.
Pretty moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talents?
The Labour Party denies that they are continuing to prepare a plan for the Englishmen to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is now considering a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the report, the party will continue to send savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, by giving them an extra day off.
Then employees would be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same salary.
Sources said the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to increase benefits for workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy announcement is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as the superiority of the party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, for the moment, the ambition is not endorsed by the whole Labour party.
A Labour Party spokesman said, 'A four-day working week is not party politics and it is not being assessed by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the previous week's Labour Conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "profiters" in wealthy businesses.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in the water supply cannot get back their full effort as a Labour government could make "deductions" due to perceived misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to place employees in corporate boards and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership fund) to provide 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees, who would receive annual returns of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500, about NOK 5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells in the TV show "60 Minutes" about FBI s in the investigation of Kavanaugh could get them to change their thoughts
The FBI investigation into complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of how far the agency found could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in the "60 Minutes" asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said on my way into the hearing, I said, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, determined, indifferent.”
However, Graham's voice seems to be seen in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York hosted for the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive set of stars performing and an equally impressive assignment; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park's big lawn, not only to enjoy seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes perform, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert attendees had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteer work; send an email to a world leader, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to help increase awareness of their goal.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clickivism" - people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, and participated in and pressed on a variety of targets.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their shares, of which at least <0x24>10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funds so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs committed to "helping children reach their full potential"; promises to provide Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving a global tweed of 4 million.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments, and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," - said the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, audience during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after having taken more than 5,000 shares to demand that the UK improve on nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In response to one of the common questions on their website, they ask "what makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizens responded: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the actors performing at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Fleet as 'block' to prevent Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington may "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an Easter to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East, is that they want to disseminate energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to cope with it.
"The U.S. has this ability, with our Fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group that presents itself as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to handling Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic solution of Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel," he said, while pointing to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been on mission to increase exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this context, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims Washington's ardent opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has pulled back from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “run hard” to run as presidential candidate in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would take a "profound look" at posing as presidential candidate after the midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider posing as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and it includes a woman at the top," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will thoroughly consider running as presidential candidate."
Warren spoke to President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said he is “guiding this country in the wrong direction.”
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has been crashing in his criticism of Trump and his supreme court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Friday tweet, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, an opinion poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should sit as a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the Senator should not stand as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-three percent supported such a nomination.
The survey showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump gathering
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being detained in September.
He was arrested and charged with a coup at home on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, makes me able to relate to other families affected by PTSD and some of the wounded with whom our soldiers are returning," she told the audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they're coming back a little bit changed, they're coming back herded, they're coming back and wondering if the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and pilots and all other military, have done for the country, exists".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of physically elected in the home against a woman, for disturbing a report of election in the home and retention of a weapon while he was rushing, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and districts of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang elections or home elections.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filed a friend-of-right briefly Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions matches that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the elective gang member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace, describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of American asylum seekers, whose nations face widespread problems with gangs and home elections.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from the Immigration Act, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing from home choices to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum cases to be judged for the particular facts and circumventing the claim, and such an obstacle violates this principle," said friend-of-court briefly.
Lawyers further argued in the summary that policies that deny immigrants access harm the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "offer the necessary work".
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims who fled abuse and gang elections in June.
"Asylum is available to those who have left their home country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems – even all serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu as deaths doubled in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It feels very exciting," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever-sick baby son at an evacuation center in the devastated city, Palu.
"Every minute ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is difficult to find."
Residents are observed on their way back to their destroyed homes, in what they search through water damaged properties and tried to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a force of 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulders, rested outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to still strong aftercare.
Tears filled his eyes as he told him that he knew the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador blames China for "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper and highlighted the mutual benefits of trade with the U.S. and China, blamed the U.S. ambassador against China Beijing for using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid allowances in the Des Moines register - the state of Iowa's largest salsavis - after accusing China of trying to interfere in U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a debt China denies.
Trump's guilt that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them in turn increase taxes on each other's imports.
China's repayment rate father early in the trade war was designed to meet exporters in states such as Iowa supporting Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime Iowa governor, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses.
"China," Branstad wrote in an opinion section of Sunday's Des Moines register, "doubles now the bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In its propaganda dissemination, the Chinese government uses America's dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited divergent voices and will not see any true reflection of the different meanings that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, given that the media is below the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers rejected his offer to publish" article, even though he did not say which one newspaper.
Republicans ask female voters to lead the midterm mine with Kavanaugh Debacle, warn Analysts.
As many top publicans are stand-by and defending Supreme Court voter Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several charges of sexual abuse, the analyst has warned that they will see enough of a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on have recorded that they already wanted to move on with a vote.
These things cannot be regretted, says Grant Reeher, professor of state science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute pressure for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday. Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is coming!" while demonstrating in the Senate Hall when Republicans, who run the court committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be beyond the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But there can be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony that detailed the allegations of sexual abuse directed against appointing Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if the Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
"This has been a confused root for GOP," said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is seen on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group contributing to the election of Democrats, pointed to the news.
But the Americans seem to be somewhat divided over whom to believe in the floodwaters of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with slightly more side trails with the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Judiciary Committee of the Senate under ownership last week that Kavanaugh completely abused her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her gender organs while attending a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a launch that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and what for people who have access to what for information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data warehouse" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, memo lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company should bring resources, processes, and appropriate abilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company consists for the moment of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some additional developers with contracts to work with the project, as well as a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on their heads overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a media post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new online collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of great influence in the net neutrality debate.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm unbelievably optimistic for this next epoch on the web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross Divine Celebration
The only English church deity who won a Victoria cross during World War I as a fighter, has been celebrated in its home town 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Water led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918 "through a very thick shoe and under heavy fire from field and machine gun."
He later ran up to the front line, and with the "largest galanter" led the line forward before alone rushing forward with a field rifle and knocking out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "now I know I could never live up to, but something I'm jealous of."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to play a role in the parade, adding that "the value of a real hero is shown by the support given by many people."
MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a packed Bellator 206but then you won't see the main event.
The San Jose account contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., precisely in what Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, viewers in the UK were again stunned when the covers changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were little impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the match.
A fan on Twitter described byte to the children's cartoon as "some sort of sick joke."
"It's public regulation that at 6 p.m. if the entrance was not owned like this, then they had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transfer.
"Peppa pig, "yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think of replay, I think we can figure it out," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday, and we don't find out this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it passed, there were many texts going forward and backwards, and all were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We held it to five games instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried to survive to the fans, and we just passed over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Sub-Med’ Due to Sexuality
Olympic stud Tom Daley says that in his adulthood he felt worse than anyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went on to school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke out about his gay rights to give other "hope".
He also said being a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter in the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
What could look like a loser in Laverne's first program, Daly said he felt "less than" all the others who grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to equal boys and girls."
He said, "From now on, having the feeling of feeling less than and feeling differently, would be the real things that have given me the strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "no," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky that he could live open without branches and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age gap had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and falls.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his entire "his" perspective had changed.
"Since you had asked me last year, it was all about I need to win a gold medal," he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had tickets to London 2012 - when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that you're not going to be on the front row," he said.
"I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of a home audience at an Olympic game, where fans didn't feel any better," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small - that had vibrated with him in the construction of the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mickelson on the bench at the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must reverse his shape to avoid it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was seen on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk ahead of Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time major winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working with his game within reach for the hope of correcting what bothers him.
Never the most competent longshoes. Not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting with the longshoes on the light, French main course, where balls hit outside if the golf player is not accurate with the stroke.
And if the path itself is not scary enough, Mickelson in the ninth game meets Sunday, the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 singles matches, get to a hot start, Mickelson's match can be quite decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, not that he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a blow on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he played two games.
I saw for myself more, but that was how it was, and that was how we thought we had to do it.
He’ll be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his proximity added some intellectual property to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to have fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the warehouse," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun getting a hangout with him too, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just playing."
Captain Thomas Bjorn Knows Big Leasing Can Be Disappeared Soon
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead on the way into the last days of Ryder Cup singles can easily be turned into an unpleasant trip.
Denmark made its debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seven Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came over the goal line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You kept reminding yourself that we had a big lease at Valderrama; we had a big lease at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far," Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, after seeing Klassa 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lease 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You're going to the full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have the point on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I've said all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Glad about how his players have behaved on a tough golf course, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: "I would never take the winner in advance.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, it will be the individual achievements that emerge, and there is another thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there individually, you’ll be tested to the fullest of your capacity as a golfer.
It's the message you need to convey to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you have left your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself too."
In contrast to Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be on the lookout after his players are to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Fury himself has been at both ends of the turnover operations in the big last days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he quit losing when Europe withdrew from "The Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had gathered his players on their way into the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start that you saw on Brookline, that you saw on Medinah.
When that moment goes a long way, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We set up our line-up correspondingly and set the guys up in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow".
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the match and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," Bjorn said of his choice of singles.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War period, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and dishonest costs, local media reported.
The launch of Rhineland-Palatinate, the lead ship of the splitting new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships the Navy ordered back in 2007, coming in place of the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest fregates for up to two years away from the ports at home.
However, continuous delays mean that the pioneering warships, which apparently allowed Germany to exercise power overseas, will already become outdated when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware errors" that rendered the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software errors were particularly important as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically overweight, reducing performance and limiting the ability of the fleet to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the cost of the entire project - including training the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached dizzying <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 3.1 billion (<0x24> 3.6 billion) - up from initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems associated with the latest frigates become particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually "has almost ended on distribution-skilled ships".
The officer said that the problem has built on over time, because old ships were diverted, but no replacement ships were delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust steals the secret life of bats
New research being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how flag mice use the landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano papistrilles and also brown elbows and Daubenton flagger mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the property to track flag mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of flagging conversations and what for species doing what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural scientist adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat, natural homes, which are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as acquisition of grassland and how it is best to maintain equal forest areas for bats and other related species.
Flag mouse populations in Scotland and over the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are believed by construction and development work affecting resting areas and loss of habitat/bay areas.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as flying paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, and also attacks by pet cats.
Flag mouse is actually not blind.
However, due to their naughty hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching predators.
They use a sophisticated ecologicalization technique to find faults and obstacles in their flight routes.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important yards and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the flag mice very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out examinations, resting-place inspections, and sometimes save lives.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated flag mice reserve at the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flag mice species.
Property manager David Thompson says that property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there's a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of checking for flag rats before performing maintenance within properties, as it is possible that infinite destruction of a single habitat can kill up to 400 female flag rats and youth, and perhaps exterminate a whole local population.
Flagger mice are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, plague or disturb them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flag mice and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects government debts in the lawyer prosecuting German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has seen the government charges against him as "fake news", saying that people "desire to stand out" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of imprisoning an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid her <0x24>375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live Instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers just hours after the charges, that the charges are "fake news."
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They will be known to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "unauthorized reporting of suspicions within the privacy area", according to Reuters
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount equal to how serious the rule violation is , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, claiming to have ruled her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the supposed incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed with "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but was later agreed on an equilibrium because she felt "feared of retaliation" and was concerned about "being publically awkward."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to change housing as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer moved to Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it lost its world-leading automotive manufacturing status after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "if" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the effect of border delays in case a non-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we see production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have raised fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what car manufacturers say is the supply chain's risk in the event of a non-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is powered on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK left the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be disturbances at the border which the industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventories at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, thus stopping production.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Checkers plan for future relations with the EU is "just calibrated to avoid border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success today, but for us to grasp this possibility," he told BBC Radio 4's daily program.
"Proof from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouwallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the facility, said that his members are more concerned with: "After my experience, when these jobs go away, they never come back.
A spokesman for the government said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting with deputy leader advocate Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back a week" as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian whaling, links between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Korvidt Trump will resign the general to the barristers or not, thus putting Mueller's self-defense at risk, has been feeding Washington slatters for several months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a lead to register conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But earlier on Monday he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid crashing with the Senate commission hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who has accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying full vote from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "No date has been set. It may be this week, but I can and see for myself that another week will be delayed due to everything else happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some reporters will probably disagree: Sanders has not held a press briefing for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of orientation was not due to a dissatisfaction with TV reporters' game for the gallery, although she said, "I'm not in disagreement that they do."
She also mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
"The president holds more press conferences than any president has done before," she said - right enough without coming up with evidence for the claim. "We've looked at the speech."
Sanders says updates will still happen, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it such a part, and you've seen us do it often in recent weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press briefing if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump is now accepting questions when he travels from the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president perhaps demonstrated why, where he acted leading the reporters without shame, and almost bizarrely.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit fears to EU workers at the NHS in Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude and a wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter although it is less than six months left before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to bear the costs of applications that have determined status for EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote as follows: "During the summer, negotiations concerning withdrawal between the UK and the EU have continued, and it is approaching the expected end of autumn.
However, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no deal.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I will now repeat how much I appreciate the contributions of all the members, no matter what nationality they have.
Colleagues from the EU, and outside, bring with them valuable experience and preparedness that strengthens and enhances the work in the health sector and is beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays at the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent an emergency operation after wearing a head injury when the team lost 31–27 to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennesseean newspaper.
Tennessee State head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, somehow," said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they placed him on a bar and took him back for further evaluation.
An official spokesman from Tennessee State, told WSMV that Abercrombie had completed operations at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There are no details about the extent of the injury yet, Harris said, adding that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie attends the second year of the university, and is in its first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before being injured in Saturday's match, and is now up for 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers must pay a higher documentary fee when buying property in the UK. The additional income will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success by attracting young voters
The increase in document fees will be added for those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The state treasury expects an increase of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The additional income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who serve a lot, promising to offer reasonable housing.
The increase in document fees will be added for individuals and firms not paying taxes in the UK, and the additional money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of traffickers.
The fees, which come in addition to the current document fee, include the higher levels introduced two years ago on residential number two and rental housing, may be as much as three percent.
The state treasury expects that the decision will receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13 percent of London’s new buildings are bought up by residents outside the UK, making prices higher, making it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many well-established areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "small towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who most of the time live in other countries.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson would cut the document fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping prices up by capturing properties but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas on reasonable housing to fix Britain's "urban scam".
Corbyn has announced a series of juicy proposals for housing reforms, including controlled leasing and the closure of unreasonable deployments.
He will and give the council greater power to build new settlements.
May said, "Last year I said that I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
It means fixing the damaged housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it may not be fair that it should be as easy for individuals not living in the UK, or foreign firms, to buy housing as it is for hard-working, British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has gone too far, and the softening of being an outcast is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate ambition" is to become manager for Scotland at some point.
Scots (42) face the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. Currently they are third in League One, just three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer, after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish elite series last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I won a B national team game, and that was it," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportssound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland on Hamden along with my father, and it has always been something that has pulled me back.
That possibility can only come if I'm successful as a club manager."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager, include Dick Advocaat, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he has not been anxious to come after so many established names in such a big club, since he has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For now, success for me will be measured in whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
Given the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I probably can only see myself as successful if I can get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the coaching apparatus of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from downgrading to third level, transforming St Mirren, who was on his way down, into championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a road split," he says of leading Alloa.
"I really thought being a manager would suit me much better than being a player.
It seemed quite bizarre, because I did well, lit well and liked it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you are happy to get through each week.
I still notice it when it comes to the stress and pressure of the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I have always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable thing I've felt in my own body throughout my adult life."
On Sunday, September 30, you can hear the entire interview on Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12am and 13pm.
Survey shows that the perfect time for a half-litre is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday
The summer heatwave has led to an increase in the intensity of striving pubs in the UK, but also increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales increased by 2.7 per cent in childcare - but for the restaurant industry it decreased by 4.8 per cent, statistics show.
Business adviser Peter Martin, behind the statistics, said: "Current sun, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern for June when pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder framed.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs selling food got and noticed the decline in the sun, although it wasn't as dramatic as it was for restaurant owners.
It may seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had declined by 3%.
Paul Newman, travel and leisure analyst at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sporting event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the nightlife industry.
It is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still endure. A drop in sales of 4.8 percent annually will be painful to get on top of a steady cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for operators operating with food. The time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can provide an awaited breathing space."
The total salinity across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the release of brands.

One in five children have secret social media profiles that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media profiles that they hide from parents and teachers, shows a survey
Investigation of 20,000 students on the move reveals an increase in "false Insta" profiles
This news has increased fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head" profile they show parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media profiles that they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in continuing school revealed a sharp increase in "false Insta" profiles - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
The news has increased fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a sterile "head" profile they refer to parents, while at the same time they have private profiles.
A mother crawling over the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to "choose me".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistakes' Conference (HMC) at various schools, found that 40 percent of those aged 11-18 had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
HMC's boss, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's worrying that so many teens are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes "the voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as non-administrative director of the Board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated sportswoman in Scotland, and board leader Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's sports community, and we are confident that Scotland's freedom of speech can benefit from getting it into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can be contributing and helping the sport in Scotland."
The American, who had gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among his total four Olympic gold and is now a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to go after a drop.
He tweeted, "Today is a month since I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it was only time that could tell me if I was going to get well again, or to what extent.
It has been exhausting work, but I have become quite good again, learned to walk again, and today I do flexibility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Shared opinions on the Internet about breast pump advertising that compares mothers with dairy cows
A breast pump company has divided opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows.
To mark what is described as "the world's first standing, seating breast pump", technology company Elvie released a small-sized advertisement inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives to mothers who are extracting milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled barn with cows, to a song that includes text such as, "Yes, I'm breastfeeding myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice it, this is not tension, it's my tits."
The refrigerator continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these children, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
The ad, which is published on the company’s Facebook page, has, on the other hand, created controversy on the internet.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it illuminates the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, only that the calves are trusted from those only days after birth," writes one.

Another commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic enough for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their kids?"
Another added, "What a smoke-free ad."
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that the song seems to be "festive."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel net like a cow.
This advertisement is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that boasts or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump packed into their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump, say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely quiet, has no pipes or pipes, and its discrete inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom to move, keep their kids, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director at Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it sustains a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers extracting milk and dairy cows, we wish to set the search light on breast pumping and the challenges associated with it, while simultaneously demonstrating the unprecedented sense of freedom the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the London fashion show, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved silently to tent camp on Texas border
The number of imprisoned immigrant children has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because of the strict policies the Trump administration has introduced making it more difficult to place the children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and accepting a child may threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk for it increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members will be satisfied to submit fingerprints, and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Earlier this week, Matthew Albence of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement of Congress testified that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied for sponsorship for single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had nothing on their roller coaster before.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and much of these are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to keep on chasing these people," Albence said.
According to the staff in the camp, new rules have now been introduced to handle the children. The rules require that some of them now must be in court before a month has passed, versus earlier 60 days.
Many will attend via video calls and not by personal attendance, to get their case tried to lead an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer their children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to electoral outbreaks or evacuation attempts, say the deputies in the camp. Reports that have appeared in recent months say the same.
Speakers say that these concerns are greater at large plants such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the plant, it is more likely that one overlooks signs of child fatigue.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or say the hatred of friends, can aggravate traumas that many have already suffered.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to retreat immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country is now at war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces behaved illegally on Syrian soil under the auspices of combating terrorism, and "will be treated from it".
"They must withdraw immediately and without prejudice," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight a holy fight entirely until all Syrian territory has been cleansed" for both terrorist groups and "illegal presence of strangers."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in that war-torn country.
When talking about the refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed "some Western countries" for having "spread irrational fear" about the environment that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return," he said.
"They make politics out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in getting reconstruction in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
UN diplomats say a newly created agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last major rebel fortress, has created an opportunity to continue pushing forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement defended a major attack from Russian-backed, Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way for the election.
Moualem laid down conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution", warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Another Term
With that logic, Trump will win the 2020 re-election if not, as many liberal viewers likely hope, the presidency gets an early end due to scandals and state law.
It would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!"
At the time of writing, there is no sign that the viewers have been bored.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its best-time rating to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has nearly tripled its rating to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has doctors at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers on nights of great news.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Why that? she asked.
“Because he makes me laugh,” he replied, following Scovell.
There is entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story that comes from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families are allowed to be reunited and healthy to the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes further than being an informed citizen when you find yourself at the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's writing of Trump's bomber jacket of strutsel<0xC3><0xA6>r to <0x24>15,000," said ana's hoodie of Daniel's "tweet" ("a hoodie of Daniel).
Personally, I will never see Super Mario again the same way.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, a daily leader at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the show that takes place with Trump's employees and daily disputes (go into a game with the NFL, relax Jo.
You can't afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you won't hang with anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate commission and the future of the Supreme Court hanged in a thin thread.
"I remember when we made all these crazy shows before in time and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money flows into the closest midfielder
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a shift of the district in Congress that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
The newly converted suburban district of Pittsburg promotes Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in spring last year.
Lamb is battling another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative of the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The map was re-drawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January ruled that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition for the 17th district has initiated a truce on the financing of the campaigns, between the major parties' money arsenal, the Democratic Congressional Committee and the Republican Congressional Committee.
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had belonged to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a little advantage.
U.S. considers punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdraws
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama for partners throwing out the Trump organization's leadership group.
The secretaries of state decided to bring back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, the ministry's spokeswoman, in a statement earlier this month.
However, punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which contained cuts to financial support and targeted restrictions with regard to visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings evolved, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year which was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top administrators announced that they wanted the conference to continue, and therefore put a stop to assessing the punishment for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been scheduled in mid-October, as a signal of the relevance the administration puts on the gathering, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A Bolton spokesman would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations of the presumption of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outsider analyst working closely with the administration and also spoke under the assumption of anonymity.
Studying History
Special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice is awaited, as there is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller has turned his focus on investigating whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia idea attacks on our election.
If Congress were to change governors, Trump would have to stand in this body, in what he is preparing to convince voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There's a lot of "what about", and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable—not even for his counterpart in Europe.
It is a choice to take for all of us on both sides of the pond, which will affect where the prolongation of the battle may be.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler, only the West had stood against him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of blood bathing this led to.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's unprecedented march is accelerated or postponed.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep waters since this newspaper revealed that last year he proposed to interrogate the president in hiding, speculating whether he is inappropriate for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the recently inquired FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or just – or is he accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we in the midterm vote for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we make mistakes, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as once occupied the country in which I had my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later sent me by guard to light the Sabbath lights on the table asking for the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that saying over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point for qualifying from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2-2 result against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it to the end, but overall indecision is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will still be a big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game. They got a good result in their previous game, but with the audience behind us I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with everything that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now everything felt good.
The staff is good and the guys are fine; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run on now, put the previous season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, few spoke to family members about it.
Approximately half of those who participated in a survey from the insurance company Nationwide, said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they are not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," says Nationwide vice president, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You can't prepare your family to take care of yourself if you don't make your wishes known well in advance.
Collaborate with a counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a big part of determining costs.
Get a financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care financing options can include a traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance with cash value to help pay the expenses, or that you insure yourself with your own wealth – as long as you have the money.
Create your legal documents: Refuse legal battles before they start.
Get a health authority in place, allowing you to appoint a person you trust to have oversight of your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also consider an authorization for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you don't have the opportunity yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Make sure that your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the finances it's all about, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
“What kind of medicine is it?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle in what he was on his way home after a tour of the city.
The victim in the 40s was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Police officers describe the shooting, which occurred around 02.30 local time, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, public officials say, the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Without the ability to communicate, aid workers have not received any information from Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake that had a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. Estimated population in 2017 was 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is an area that stretches over more than 300 km with coastline northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming is the beacon of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated to Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Office.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and several hundred houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the western side of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Fire Ring in the Pacific Ocean and is likely to be framed by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of these in Aceh.
2005: A series of major earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of approximately 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as people were reminded of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 died due to buildings that crashed.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok and kill more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily on the beach.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested and targeted for home election
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested, targeted for assault.
According to a report released by Alaska state police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of home election, interference in reporting home election and objecting to arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance as she tried to call the police to report the crime.
Palin is imprisoned in the Mat-Su prison, and is held on bail <0x24>500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court Saturday and declared himself "not guilty" when asked, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A crimes, which means he can be imprisoned for up to one year and receive <0x24>250,000 in fines.
He has also been tried for a Class B offence, which can be punished with a day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin has been charged with anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
Saka is up in the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was targeted for domestic attacks, interference in a report of domestic election and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he beat her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups after linking her son's electoral behavior to PTSD originating from when he served in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds lost their lives
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, with a force of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed several thousand homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the number of casualties is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawesi, which is northeast of the capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the dramatic moment when the earthquake hits, flourish on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal actors will rarely have the death penalty for suspect in New York terror
Federal attorneys in New York will have the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) is said to have used a rented car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along West Side Highway on lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the actors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "willfully" and that he "willfully" inflicted them severe, physical harm, according to a note filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may be the cause of a possible death penalty, it says in the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 indictments, including eight murder convictions aimed at money laundering, commonly used by federal prosecutors in connection with organized crime, and a conviction for the election and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and oversight", the actors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "abhorrent, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", it says in the note.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time the southern district of New York has condemned the death penalty in a case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two doppelgängers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told the detectives what he had done best, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing videos from ISIS on the phone, the prosecution said.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty on all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "clearly disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that deciding to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of the event for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the actors not to go after the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should lease Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army" today, during a protest at the Tory country meeting.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said that the police had to "feel the pressure" from the Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should lease the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, thought-provoking MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham demonstrators that Britain "had been out" now, if Farage was a Brexit minister.
With May's challenge facing reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by the Tories wishing to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggled to keep up with the Chequers compromise on track following attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers as well as the EU.
Allies insist that she will press for an agreement with Brussels, despite the retreat – and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and "chaos".
Bone told Leave Means Leave groupings in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers"
He suggested that Farage should be given noble rank and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had ruled, we would be out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP, added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said: "We are not fighting world wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejects the claim that the people's opinion has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to be, is totally untrue".
The Brexit fighter from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in the march, telling reporters, "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
"Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us elected initially.
Please drop the Chequers and listen to me.”
In a message addressed to May, she added, "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep what they promise."
Farage said that police must "know the heat" if they come to betray the decisions that were made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that 'we're not going to let them get away with it'."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to get the political class, who is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to know the warmth.
"We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us say in Brexit and should not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud UK.
At the same time, the Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the center.
A handful of activists fanned up with "Tories Against Brexit" banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for safety issues they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take a "clean look" on posing for presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take "a careful look at running for presidential election" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a city meeting west in Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, runs for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was but a member of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She has been the center of too much speculation that she may be trying against Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke event on Saturday was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump joined.
A participant asked if she had plans to run for presidential elections.
Warren responded that it's time "women take the trip to Washington to fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest in shooting of Louisiana State University player Sims
Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the case where Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims was shot and killed Friday.
At 11.00 local time, police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen on the video.
Sims (20) were shot and killed early Friday in the southern area of the university.
"Wayde Sims suffered a headshot and eventually died as a result of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, writing 247sports.
Wayde entered to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In an interview, Simpson has admitted that he was on the scene, with guns, and admitted that he shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without drama and detained at the Police Department in Australasia Baton Rouge.
A third-year student of nearly two metres, waking up in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games, ten of them from the start of the previous season, when he averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns in each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give say over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes teams would have a major role in the race.
Bottas made a good start in the race, allowing Hamilton to take care of himself in defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and allowed Hamilton to enter traffic at the back of the track, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes drove into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton harbored the front after some action side-on side-side which forced the Ferrari driver to let the interior be free in danger of not being able to defend itself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, in the back row and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led much of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of running past Kimi Raikkonen who lay in fourth place.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but failed to speed up the last eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day, for Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not laugh the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she accuses Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony Ford had given directly to the Senate Commission, but rather commented that what is taking place in the Senate showed that people were "bad and bad and speaking false".
"The last thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and unpleasant and speaking falsely," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and then say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you okay?
Do you remember her answer... paint the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I don't like it."
Wait for a moment.
We laughed... No, we didn't laugh," he added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September - but Feinstein refused that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't hide her history," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked."
But her denial does not fall into good ground with the president, who commented on Saturday's election meeting: "I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with poor sexual behavior by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the accused for their own gain.
"They are determined to take back power in every way they feel necessary.
You see the ugliness, the ugliness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run against to get power and control," said the president according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3)
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee stars compensated for the loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return game 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants were early given a two-way lead due to attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated before Dwyer once again sent the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the league this season for the boys of Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, where the Giants have won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute after an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford served an assist to Beauvillier who doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan got the home team back in the game in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt secured the match for Cownie in the 16th minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lease into pause as he scored his second goal for the evening on the tampon of the first time.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard again secured an equalization with a brilliant goal after 27 minutes of play.
In late second round, Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen secure Dundee lead for the first time in the match, securing the winner with the team's fifth goal in the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, face Milton Keynes at home in the next game, which is on Friday.
Airplane owners lose their lives to ensure hundreds of planes escape earthquakes
A pilot in Indonesia is praised as a hero after he lost his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers gets safely in the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disrupt the area, and many are trapped in wreckage in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, even though it turned wild.
He remained to make sure that the plane on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of deaths will increase to thousands, while the country's crisis relief agency says access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The number of deaths is increasing as we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we cannot reach," said office spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres have destroyed Palu, which is expected to hold a mass excavation on Sunday.
Emergency aid comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with more bodies.
It is difficult to find clean water.
The little boys have been robbed.”
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is striving to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military in the country: "I ask all of you to work around the clock to do everything you can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok, killing 550 people.
Air Niugini Reports Missing Man After Lagune Flight
The airline operating a plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific reports that a man is missing, having previously stated that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that as of Saturday afternoon they do not know where the male passenger is.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not provide any more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been sent to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually caused it.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane flew past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to flow through the water, which brought them up to life, to the nautical exits of the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew was panicking and screaming, and he suffered a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said nearby sailors, who were working out a whale, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat that they used to transport passengers to land before the plane sank about 30 metres.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website show that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines' flights over the past 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts create timeline overnight when woman became burned alive
The prosecution provided all evidence on Saturday during the pending trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he puzzled recordings from mobile phones to find out what she liked the night Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the accused, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett told him that he was using location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, unlike what Tellis explained earlier.
When location data showed that Tellis' mobile phone was with Chambers' mobile simultaneously as he said he was with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was out on that day.
When the defendant asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he "laughed, because my car was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their mobile phone bills showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is due to close the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later on the same day.
What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio will challenge the music genre's negative reputation by filling their music with positive thoughts.
The High Abla of Bristol, England, says hip hop has moved away from the original political idea of tackling problems in society.
They will go back to hip hop's roots and make the conscious version of the genre popular again.
Artists The Fugees of Common have become more popular again in the UK through the artists Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York babysitters sue couple for fired after 'racist' text message
A New York babysitter sues a couple for giving her fire based on discrimination after she received a wrongful text message from her mother complaining that she was "just a black person."
The couple have denied being racist, comparing the lawsuit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the babysitter she had added, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEI, ENDA A SWART PERIOD," Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent him to the babysitter Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman gave the babysitter Maurice fired, saying that the former babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she would have someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for giving her fired. She wants <0x24>350 a day for six months for the job she would have had, even if it was without a contract, where she would live with the family.
"I want to show them that it's not okay to do that," she told The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know there's discrimination."
The couple have denied being racist, saying that giving Maurice fired was the only thing they could do after insulting her, because they were afraid that she would take revenge.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you've offended take care of your children, even if you didn't mean to offend them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.”
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion," saying that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you really going to attack a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," investor Plasco said.
As the case progresses, the public has been quick to judge the pair on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid that people would not like a talking bear, reveals new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's really fun to know now how successful Paddington became."
Jankel said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She added that she had mixed feelings during her 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
As for Paddington, which she described as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was confident inside of how much success he had made.
"He was a fairly quiet man, and he never screamed," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who achieved something: you become proud of them even if it's not really you who's behind.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all the praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was about to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice in a hurry, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to handle it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"So Nad called to say that she was about to die within the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be there soon.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping was slowly getting out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was about to turn off.
I just sat there, knowing that this happened.
I couldn't lie or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by family and people.
I really had to keep everything in."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now saddened by the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane along with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
"No one knew anything," she said.
"I sat with my head bent while the tears fell."
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Suffering Women Hang Patterns on Bridge to Prevent Suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who took suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached notes on a bridge in Wales to inspire and get people who are planning to take suicide to change their mind and call the numbers on the notes.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I do every day."
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said that her son was a talented cook with a smile that infected.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said that his smile glowed up all the rooms."
But before he died he stopped working, because he was in a "very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still concerned that the little brother may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes "to let people know that there are other people out there who care about and with whom they can talk, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone - you have to talk to anyone."
Humphreys, who has been Davis' friend for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me that he was sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he started acting differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on the 1st Christmas day, when the children opened their gifts he did not look at them alone."
She told me that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continued to work through the trauma: "There's a huge void in our family now.
We're totally destroyed.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI begins investigation
"I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he asks for—a limited investigation—then maybe we could achieve some loneliness," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he is afraid of the committee "falling together" amid a partisan backlock.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The midterm election in the United States is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans do not do it well, this will make it difficult for them to elect Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then has been the secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh is able to collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, with 50 votes, Mike Pense, the vice president of the United States, can give him the last vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of detachments ‘down’ under Kim
The number of North Korean robbers to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator reports
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, saying there were 1,127 buyers last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive traffic charges are the main reasons the number has declined.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean buyers are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most refugees via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China sees mercenaries as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often sends them back by force.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are purely technically still at war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to negotiate the decommissioning of nuclear weapons.
These talks come after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for not achieving anything then.
"Without being able to trust the United States we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot lower our weapons first," Ri said in a speech at the UN's New York General Assembly.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," saying he cannot serve in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he has too much temperament to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I knew that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all allegations that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh's opening speech, he was very emotional and sometimes screamed with clues in his throat while telling about his family and years on the move.
He criticized the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and a planned assassination of his reputation," organized by liberal policemen who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is prejudiced against Democrats.
"I believe that the way he behaved disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi came up with an objection when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to leave if he is elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats achieve a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he can't serve in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he serves now," Pelosi added.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington D.C.'s federal court of appeal.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat she is concerned about potential Kavanaugh judges against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great," Pelosi said.
And women must swing the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of anger, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We scream when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high corporate position, who said she noticed when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she noticed, "You might think I'm sorry because I did.
I'm angry."
And then just continue.
I think it was brilliant.
Tears act as a way of getting your mind out, but there are many who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories from a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I could sense anger, and a woman who was older than me took me by the neck – she was a cold leader I had always been afraid of – and pulled me out on the run.
"They never let you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and that they're drinking because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a Colorado Democrat, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was caught on a boat called Monkey Business, and resigned from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that she could as well run for president himself.
"I hadn't really thought through it well enough," she told me while laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running for election, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already been going on for a while, she hadn't raised enough money, so she promised to only ask if she was able to raise <0x24>2 million.
That was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave <0x24>1000 to men only gave her <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she was not going to make choices however, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target the voices of the delegates instead of the delegates, and anger against gender discrimination, that she began to take
"You should have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said of how the press reacted when she branched.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
"I've got it?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening ointments in the U.S.-China trade war were eerie, and while the battle continues, a rift between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump shot the first shot this year in taxing important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over <0x24>200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken hemmings and set tariffs of between five and ten percent on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has promised to answer the United States for every shot they fired, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to fail with the first.
To get Washington to quit, China has to do what the United States wants, but to turn to the United States is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, U.S. pressure could have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long run, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause both economies to undermine is more dangerous than people have dared to admit before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says they are ready to welcome refugees who will return voluntarily, asking for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are making progress.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to regain normal areas.
All prerequisites are now in place for refugees to be able to return voluntarily to the country they had to travel in due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond daily life and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would gladly accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they will not accept assistance or help with conditions from countries sponsoring the uprising.
Europe will win Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup when they beat the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown in the team of the Danish captain, Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, reaching the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, slipped most of the tournament. He beat the ball in the water from the tee-on at hole 16, par 3, thus giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari did well in all of his rounds and became one of four players who have ever won 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5&4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, became 2 and 1 after Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio García, who has participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the most-winning European with 25.5 points in his career.
"Normally I didn't beg, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so, so glad to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," an emotional Garcia said after the European victory.
He forwards the stick stick to countryman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles games on Sunday.
"I feel a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grow up looking at him," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now has a 13-21-3 merit list in the Ryder Cup up through his career.
A strange stat from one of the world's best players, who has won 14 major titles and is only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, spoke after a disappointing performance from his team. "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
Stroke me.
Hat off to Thomas.
He's a one-time captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA in America and our committee for the Ryder Cup and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be the captain.
You have to take off the hat.
We got rounded up.”
