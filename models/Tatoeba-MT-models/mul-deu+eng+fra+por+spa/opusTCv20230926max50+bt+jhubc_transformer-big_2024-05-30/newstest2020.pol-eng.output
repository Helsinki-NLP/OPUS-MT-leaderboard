Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's a charismatic.
The mass of the holy Mass of Liberation and Healing, which he performed, is carried out by the crowds.
He was a dozen years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the franciscans, others are experiencing this.
Mass of liberation and healing held by St. Witko is being held by the crowds
Once upon a time, the parents of a 7-month-old child came to him, who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed for him.
The same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
The doctors were surprised: “Operation is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm.”
My parents were crying out for happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The Creator’s extraordinary spiritual activities began to be experienced as a teenager.
In his dreams, clean souls came to him with a request for help.
I was awakened at night and induced to pray for the dead and those who died at that moment.
He also experienced the presence of the evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what was going on with a man who committed a mortal sin.
“My body is starting to change.
I lost my human traits and began to take on the appearance of an animal,” he says.
The invisible force pushed him up, he could not get a voice out of himself.
He felt like he was lost.
Then God showed him a savior.
“Sunned in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was released and returned to the human form...”
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
There was a call in it.
He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he did not just want to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people who are counting on getting rid of the disease participate in the healing messes performed by Father Witko.
The clergy, however, emphasizes that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical.
First defeat of Kolping FRAC Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw
Today (September 26th) the team of Kolping FRAC earned the current Polish champion Dartom Bogorii Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd round of the LOTTO Superliga of Table Tennis.
Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw in the personal setup that they presented with the men's teams, they have little chance of winning with the league's sovereigns.
It was a great show with Darth Bogor.
The team is still missing, named as the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the spring they would reach the third consecutive triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han probably has not yet grown up to win with such tricks as the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or the Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, namely Mark Badowski.
Hellady was the biggest star of the single in the MOSiR hall at Sikorski Street in Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Both starting with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class for themselves.
After three doubles, Kolping FRAC led 2-1.
Kou Lei probably embraced Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an exciting, five-year struggle – Pavlo Sirucka.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
There was still hope to win by two points, but Qiyao Han did not agree with Badowski.
There will be no further research for seniors.
What's wrong?
According to Rafael Trzaskowski’s predictions, a free prophylactic research program for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs.
In its justification, the agency explained that the target group was mishandled.
“The above actions may actually result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to aggravating difficulties in accessing NFZ benefits and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with the false findings.”
The decision of the resort is not understood by the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have the money foreseen.
Only the government fears that if people are being examined, they will later go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is precisely to lead to a situation where prevention can be carried out faster.
All specialists know that it helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I don’t understand,” Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski said.
“It’s hard for me to imagine running specialists saying, ‘Don’t worry, there will be longer queues with the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I’m not surprised that the health service is in this state.’
Israel’s response to Palestine: “We’ll break any agreements we’ve made so far”
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced on Thursday at a session of the UN General Assembly that he would terminate any agreements concluded with Israel if the country’s upcoming government attempts to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement of annexation of occupied Palestinian land.
“If the future government of Israel, which will be formed, comes to the realization of this plan, we will annul all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made,” he said.
“We will completely and completely reject the whole plan,” Abbas said.
“It is our duty to defend all our rights by all means possible – no matter what the consequences will be – by fully engaged in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism,” the president said in a statement.
Netanyahu, Israel’s former prime minister, was once again given a mandate to form a government after the September 17 election.
A week before the election, he announced that if he wins, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank to Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Jaser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during the session of the UN General Assembly to hold universal elections in the Palestinian territories.
The last was in 2006.
“When I return to the country, I will call for local elections in the West Bank, in the Gaza Strip and in East Jerusalem, and everyone who opposes them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,” the Palestinian president said.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, deemed a permanent observer at the UN, to exercise the powers of “full members of the UN and all its organs and institutions.”
The Palestinian leader concluded the speech by calling on the international community to “force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations with full respect.”
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas’s speech, stating that the Palestinian leader “will focus at the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority directed against Israel rather than fight against calls for terrorism in its autonomy under its control.”
Danon, however, did not refer to Netanyahu’s predicted annexation of occupied Palestinian land.
Rescuers want defibrillators at neuralgic points
The history of crossing the border shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save lives.
The Voivodeship Emergency Station in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>lu wants such devices to be located in the neuralgic points of the city.
For their position, the officials received congratulatory diplomas from the Voivodeship Emergency Station in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officials of the Podkarpack Customs Office in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
On August 28, they were serving at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medicine. A Customs and Treasury Service official noticed an unconscious man lying in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist has died in detention from torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Cao Shuxia, the activist’s wife, was called by a Communist Party secretary from her family village on September 23 to inform her that her husband had just died at a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death, he did not reveal.
In the cave Cao saw the body of her husband massacred, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in the blood,” she says.
“They didn’t let me take my cell phones with them, and there were a lot of cops around who couldn’t get close to Wang.”
Police were pressuring to sign a statement that his husband was seriously ill and died as a result of an "unfortunate accident".
PLN 105 million for companies in the video game industry from the National Center for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of co-financing will go to companies in the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Center for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the 3rd edition of the GameINN program.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR, the development of a platform for the creation of games on the basis of an AR game engine, which creates a map of the real world, together with an application for the transmission of data from the users, and the development of a platform for the development of the field games.
The aim of the GameINN sector program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game producers sector in the global market in the perspective of 2023.
According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion, and the forecast for 2019 was 2.23 billion.
“The specially prepared research agenda of GameINN and already reaching PLN 300 million in support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme is a significant impetus for further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev,” reads the statement.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
“Governmentally introduced incentives for entrepreneurs to innovate, such as R&D reliefs, competence improvement programs, IP boxes or support programs implemented by NCBR drive innovative companies, and allow them to compete more effectively for competitive, competitive and competitive competitions.”
The head of the science resort notes that money for innovation not only reaches innovators in the form of project co-financing, but also stays in their pockets – with the relief of R&D in 2018 benefited three-quarters more entrepreneurs than a year earlier.
“The amount of deducted costs related to R&D activities amounted to 1.7 billion zlotys, which gave more than 300 million zlotys of savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of NCBR’s support in three editions of GameINN,” said the deputy prime minister.
The Director of NCBR, Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki, recalls that 78 innovative projects have been awarded funding worth more than PLN 211.2 million in the two previous competitions.
The huge interest in the third competition and the diversity of applications show that the video game industry has the ideas and competencies to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“I am particularly pleased that among the projects that have been launched – as in previous editions – there are projects for solutions that serve not only entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0,” he adds.
In the third GameINN competition for funding up to PLN 20 million, entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific entities were able to apply.
The NCBR was affected by 87 requests for a total amount of co-financing of about PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million co-financing.
Detailed information on the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available on ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral program is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Program.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of the entrepreneurs associated in the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga admits to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
The event took place on September 16.
Dolberg, who arrived from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, learned after training that his watch had disappeared from the closet.
No matter what, it's worth <0x24>70,000.
Angry Danish the next day did not show up at the class, resulting in stomach problems.
The matter was mysterious from the beginning.
Players in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga finally admitted to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and his other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to give back the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young generation footballers in France.
He came to Nice at the age of thirteen to debut in the first team three years later.
He played in seven matches this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but – as reported by the newspaper “L’Equipe” – the club is likely to dissolve him with immediate effect.
So far, he has initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well.
We all know that you need to wash them (e.g. when you get home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you need to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that autumnal infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for the wash to remove sufficiently dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
And most of us do it shorter.
Just warm water and plain soap – it’s not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors even recommend it).
When washing, we shave not only the bottoms and tops of the hands, but also: the fingertips (connected or single) – shave them with collisive movements inside the other hand, the space between the fingers (spread the hands, shave it with your fingers, and with your fingers, and with your fingers – each other’s thumbs.
In an emergency situation (when you can not wash your hands) you should rinse your hands with a wet towel, and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from 5 PLN).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the handles or doors with washed hands (recommended by the Main Sanitary Inspector).
Open them through a paper towel.
Iran’s President Says He Rejected Proposal for US Talks, Donald Trump Denies
Tehran did not hold talks with the U.S. side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite a bid by the U.S. to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hasan Rowhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that the Iranian side had called for the lifting of restrictions, which he did not agree with.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rowhani, the U.S. has proposed lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran’s nuclear program and the ballistic missile program.
Rohani: Iran will not take talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The president of Iran said he did not agree to the talks because of the “toxic atmosphere.”
He said he had met with U.S. diplomats because he was in trouble with France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran will not engage in talks in an atmosphere of “maximum pressure”.
“And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5<0x2B>1, no one is able to predict what the final result will be,” Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the United States and accused the European parties of favouring U.S. sanctions on Iran.
He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal "are a prerequisite that does not allow" the establishment of a dialogue.
“If we can stand this precondition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,” he said.
He added that he did not rule out meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a talk last week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”
Donald Trump tweeted that he was the one who rejected the Iranian side’s request.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
“I said ‘no’,” the president tweeted.
Voltage with atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to somehow save the 2015 Iran deal they were signatories to.
In exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran will give up its nuclear weapons program and the nuclear sector will be controlled by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the U.S. withdrawal from the deal in May 2015, its other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the deal in effect.
Nothing has come out of it so far.
Washington is applying maximum pressure tactics on Iran, and sanctions include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not get a permit to export raw materials every 60 days, it will limit its commitments under the agreement.

The judge of the Voivodeship Administrative Court in Warsaw and her husband Emilia, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsApp, participated in a harassment against the judges, was reinstated by the NSA on Wednesday.
Reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, and therefore there is no basis to uphold the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to deprive him of his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary attorney at the NSA, initiated an explanatory proceedings against Smydt at the end of August, but it has not so far turned into a proceeding against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must make a decision by the WSA president within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly told his wife about mental problems to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office due to suspicions of participation in the heated group, will return to court and will issue a verdict in the name of the Polish court.
Judge Szmydt denies his participation in the heterogroup.
He says there's no evidence for this but the fake screens and the words of his wife he's divorced from.
Exactly the same is said by the other judges associated with the “Cast”: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they'll bet on their own.
Because the prosecution did not pull the finger to secure the evidence from their electronic carriers, it also remained silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt’s phone, which stopped it in June in another case.
The police did not pull their fingers to protect the devices of those who were being targeted as persecutors in a February report by Judge Waldemar <0xC5><0xBB>urek.
There's no evidence - there's no Smydt's case, there's no "Kasty" case.
There is also no case of NIK chief Marian Banasia about renting a stove to the suburbs and hiding income.
The CBA verifies its property statements.
And he'll check when he checks.
And the Business Ethics Commission Banasi will not be involved, because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Commission has somehow gathered to make a curious decision to call Banasi’s deputies and to appoint him as a lawyer, albeit the law of such a non-combined jurisdiction).
The whole thing reminds me of an American movie novel about how my wife returns home and stays with her husband and lover in bed.
She's so stunned and stunned that she can't spell words.
She is standing in the doorway, and at this time the lover quickly jumps out of the bed, dresses up and goes out.
And the man was bedridden.
When the wife regains her voice and cries: What is it to be?
Who's that woman?
The husband calmly asks, "What woman, darling?"
But in the case of "Kasty" or Banasia, the parody of the state goes.
And that's not funny at all.
MAXIPIZA: Signing with a current auditor of the agreement to examine the financial statements for 2019, 2020 and 2021.

Kamila Li<0xC4><0x87>winko in the final jump up
Earlier this season, returning to the competition after a mother-in-law break, the London 2017 World Cup bronze medalist won 1.85 and 1.89 in the first attempt and 1.92 in the second.
1.94 managed to get it only in the third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final, I will have to jump better technically,” Li<0xC4><0x8D>winko admitted in front of the Eurosport camera.
Vashti Cunningham and Karina Demidik were the best in the eliminations, after 1.94.
The two players were the only ones who didn’t hit any heights.
The women's jump final is scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7:30 p.m. Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in hospital in severe condition
He got to the hospital, and the doctors described his condition as severe.
You have to add that he is conscious and conscious.
“We believe that it will come out that he will win again.
We are all praying that he will return to his health,” said an anonymous close friend of Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with journalists of “Super Express”.
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is nominated for the Senate.
“I have the closest family and politician in my life,” Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview he gave to reporters at Super Express two weeks ago.
In January, “Super Express” reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki went to the Military Hospital in Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and I went to the hospital.
It turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When a computer tomography test was performed, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...”
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.
According to Morawiecki, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain to the hospital Zbigniew Kras.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know that a lot of people have prayed for me for what I am so grateful for.
Fortunately, I don't have any transfers.
I don't know if I'm going to have chemo.
I give myself into the hands of doctors of specialists who are rather good-thought.
For now, after this severe operation, I have to go back to some state of utility.
I hope everything will be fine,” Kornel Morawiecki said in January in an interview with SE.
“If I had given up too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to the fall already,” he added.
Krakow: 14-year-old missing
Officials from the City Police Command in Krakow are looking for 14-year-old Nel Stok<0xC5><0x82>ossa.

The missing woman left her place of residence on the evening of September 26 and has not yet returned or made any contact with her relatives.
The last time she was seen was at Old Go<0xC5><0x9B>ciniec Street in Krakow.
Nel Stok<0xC5><0x82>osa is 14 years old, measures 167 cm, has blond hair and blue eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in a blouse, grey pants and shoes.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is asked to contact the police at 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
Power of Olaw jumps.
The title of the relationship with the amateur sports competitions played on Sunday afternoon September 15 at the hippodrome on Oleandra Street in O<0xC5><0x82>aw, may be misleading for some.
To the true power of the road is far away, but that is what one kind of horse competition is called.
The competition for the power of jumps is to overcome ever-increasing obstacles by riders and horses, which in the most prestigious international races exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding that the long-term and still unbeatable world record, established in 1949, by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
So high in O<0xC5><0x82>ava, of course, no one jumped, but the score of the best local Amazons at the level of 135 cm is also not one of the worst...
The competitions organised by the untiring Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists “In the Seat” were part of the showcase of some of the “Tr<0xC4><0x99>cz<0xC4><0x85><0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>i<0xC4><0x87>i zajdno<0xC4><0x87>i”, about which we write more in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight Amazons joined the competition, training riding in the O<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0x84> JKS.
Four were competing on cocks and four on big horses.
In the first group was best written by Nikola Szo<0xC5><0x82>dra, arriving in the crazy "Sprinter".
This small but how dynamic rumaja began by overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only when stationed with a top beam 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily, and only after three further rejections was the jury rejected from further competition.
Amelia Pawlak took the second place in the puppet jumps, reaching "Famy", and Lena Boru<0xC5><0x84> took the third place on "Harmiderze".
Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galoping and jumping through obstacles on the small slope "Carmen".
Even greater emotion was accompanied by the launching Amazons and viewers during the competition with the participation of large horses.
Threat-looking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, arriving in the "Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding on the "Lotce".
Fortunately, nothing bad happened to the horses or the Amazons, so they went on to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young lady "Wineta" to the park were encountered by Veronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz.
You needed either the coach's assistant, or another horse to the pair, followed by a little crazy "Wineta".
After calculating the obstacle from the park, she also slipped full of rage, so it was dangerous for moments in boxing and in the relaxation. “Everything is under control!”, calmed Jan Sienkiewicz a little bit of the frightened viewers, especially the youngest.
From the beginning of the competition for big horses, Marta Masalska was great at the park, reaching the beautifully presenting "Whisky".
This decent kick, coupled with experienced amazon, behind the second approach in the final phase first jumped 135 cm and that was the best result at the time.
After that, however, Paulina Szewczyk on the “Declaration”, Veronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz on the “Wine” and Anastasia Abramenko on the “Lotce” included the same amount.
To decorate the flo and after receiving the real prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these players went together, and in the end, together with the Amazons on the wrists in the pace of the Radecki march, they made an impressive honorary round, ending her with these interesting and emotional.
Gratitude
The Equestrian Sports Club "In Siodle" warmly thanks the sponsors of the Jumping Power Competition during the 16th "Tarcz<0xC4><0xB1>k<0xC5><0xAF>wy <0xC5><0xBE>upadyskiy": the City Office in O<0xC5><0x82>aw, the Water Supply and Sewerage Plant in O<0xC5><0x82>aw, the Municipality of Powieatow and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko cuts off KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation of <0x23>R Revolution Mariusz Max Kolonki was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Mark Jakubiak or Pavel Kukiz, but none of these coalitions happened, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko himself was unable to collect even enough signatures in a number of poles to stand out.
Kolonko has now announced on Twitter that he has ended his cooperation with the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I will expect from the KWW to delete my name from the name.
Please don’t connect my person with/in the specified entity,” he added and announced that more information will be provided soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his activity or whether it will be the end of the <0x23>R Revolution formation.
On July 4, on American Independence Day, US journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko announced the emergence of a new political formation - <0x23>R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has been famous for conducting on the YouTube channel Max TV, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We have enough politicians, enough of your crazy games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the state to embrace the Nation and govern for the good of the Nation,” Kolonko said.
The party's programme included issues relating to the judiciary (should be chosen in the general elections), tax changes (comparing the amount of tax free for all), military repairs (in the form of military aid for the eastern side), military assistance for the Polish side, and the NATO referendum in particular.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined the talks with Mark Jakubiak.
In late July, Kolonko posted information on his social media profile suggesting that <0x23>R will join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
None of these coalitions, however, eventually happened.
UBS: Gold near equilibrium point
“The euro rate will remain around the PLN 4.35 in the coming months, which will be accompanied by weak global markets,” said Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
“Expectations to maintain a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilizing gold quotes at the current threshold,” an expert said in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his opinion, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council does not decide on rising rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are alleviating policy.
“If the gold is properly valued – the euro securities should remain around the PLN 4.35 in the coming months – Polish bonds are not that attractive.
Much more profitable profitability than Polish securities offer bonds from emerging markets,” says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation to emerging markets with UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world economy.
“Global slowdown may go further, but there should not be a severe recession, and at the very least a decline in GDP dynamics slightly below zero,” Bolliger said.
“Investors should not undermine global actions that may be harmed by the lack of prospects for a U.S.-China trade conflict resolution and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump’s impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Europe should be the relatively weakest of the stock markets," according to the latest letter to investors from UBS Wealth Management Manager Mark Haefele.
“The stocks of eurozone countries should behave worse than those of the United States because they are more vulnerable in the face of increased uncertainty around global trade and fears of slowing down,” the document reads.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the loophole in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed German 10-year-olds’ profitability to even minus 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the fall in profitability.
However, in the longer term, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, and only short-term, due to the easing of banks’ monetary policy.
The Fed’s biggest field of interest rate cuts, which is expected to weaken the U.S. currency over the next few years.
The long-term equilibrium point for euro notes is a <0x24>1.29 threshold, which would mean a 19 percent potential to strengthen the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further declines in Fed rates, which will result in a reduction in the differences in monetary policy in the world.
“To maintain the strength of the dollar in the long run may not allow deficits in the current and budget accounts,” Michael Bolliger predicts.
The Bundeswehr loses its guns.
Confidential report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has reported the disappearance of 39 pieces of weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 pieces of ammunition, as a result of a confidential compilation made at the RFN defence resort.
The information was provided by the press of the editorial group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the office of the parliamentary secretary of state at MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two pieces of weapons, one part of them and 3474 pieces of ammunition, have been redirected so far.
Among the military equipment that is still missing include: six universal MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 rifles.
In addition, 30 luffs are missing for MG3 machine guns.
Concern was expressed by Left Party Vice-President Martin Renner.
As she told RND reporters, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “repellent.”
Moreover, as a result of the investigations carried out, only a small portion of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summarized the effects of these actions as an “emergency balance sheet”.
She also criticized the fact that the compilation did not show whether there was a weapon found in the investigation against Lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a heavy-handed act of violence and threatening to protect the state.
The officer was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians from far-right and racist incitements.
His "black list" of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor's office, included then-Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu-Berlin foundation.
Franco A. illegally entered the possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 pieces of ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Crying children on a plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
Japan Airlines has recently been using a feature designed to help people who have a nightmare when travelling with a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the layout of the seats on the plane.
If a minor travels to the second year of life, the "child icon" appears on a specific, reserved by the parents or guardians of the seat.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the possibility to choose a place far from the one occupied by the child.
According to the BBC, the lines have already reported the imperfections of the solution.
The "child icon" will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third person or if the flight has been changed at the last moment.
As you might expect, the idea was shared by internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids, we used to be them.
“We need to learn to tolerate, because soon we will need a map of sitting places for breathing mouths, sneezing or drinking,” G Sundar wrote.
Another of the Internet users noted that he was once disturbed by crying children on a plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also a lack of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me of screaming children during the 13-hour journey,” Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Majorca counts losses after bankruptcy of travel agency Thomas Cook
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not come to Majorca on holiday in October as a result of Monday’s bankruptcy by travel agency Thomas Cook.
As the representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands Marc Pons reported on Friday, among the 25,000 timers who will not be able to take advantage of the October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly related to Necker.
Pons explained that 80 percent of the expected timers, who had to give up their vacation in Majorca next month due to the British company’s failure, are citizens of Germany and Scandinavian countries.
However, according to Pons, due to the fact that Thomas Cook did not guide tourists to the Balearic Islands during the November-December period, the losses for the local economy will be less.
He revealed that the Balearic government has already begun negotiations with international operators on “admission to the Majorca market” following the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the newspaper Diario de Mallorca, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Majorca.
Approximately 800 employees of Thomas Cook’s office in Palmyra have been fired.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, along with Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy announcement in many Majorca hotels, property owners requested guests to pay an extra fee per night.
This situation has been experienced, among other things, by dozens of tourists from Poland.
The government of the Balearic Islands estimates that by Thursday several dozen hotels in Majorca had suspended operations at least until the end of October due to the announcement of the bankruptcy by Thomas Cook and his co-operating companies.
The Diario de Ibiza, on the other hand, shows that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza, which have partnered with the Thomas Cook group, are not planning to close their premises in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic Island, a British bankruptcy co-operated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous authorities of the Balearic Islands announced that they would appeal to the Spanish government to support the region in the amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million to cover the losses caused by the announcement of bankruptcy by travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most damaged tourists in the archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Majorca.
According to the Balearic government, Thomas Cook will charge local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, with the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019 of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million.
FIFA Women's Ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, USA at the top
The Polish women’s team is ranked 29th in the ranking of the International Federation of Football (FIFA) published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Mi<0xC5><0x82>osz St<0xC4><0x99>pi<0xC5><0x84>ski was classified in the previous July draft.
Weak team matches.
How will it be in October?
The leaders were the Americans, who recently defended the title of world champions.
The second place in the ranking was maintained by the Germans, and the third left by the Dutch.
Poles are preparing for the ME qualification.
They were scheduled to start their departure match with the Czechs on 3 September.
The day before the meeting, due to the food poisoning of the opponents, it was postponed for one year.
In this situation, the Poles will open qualifications by meeting with the Spaniards on November 12 in Lublin.
Previously, “White-Red” will play two friendly matches – on October 3 on departure from Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group rivals Poland are the representatives of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The group winners and the top three teams from the second place advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second positions will play in the bars with the last three passes to the European Championships.
The 16 participants will be complemented by the host – England.
The men's national team in FIFA's September ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": Smog crushed the government
“The effects of the ‘Clean Air’ program are negligible, and the coal furnaces will climb this winter as if they were never anything,” reads the first page of today’s ‘Clean Air’.
“So far, 82 thousand requests for co-financing in the amount of PLN 2 billion have been submitted under the Clean Air programme, of which 48 thousand were positive.
The accepted requests amount to more than PLN 915 million," Rz said, referring to data from the spokesman for the Ministry of the Environment.
As the newspaper notes, only a part of the cost is reimbursed from the program.
The results of the darkly announced program are judged by the diary as "moderate".
Self-government officials, quoted by “Rz”, are complaining about the failures of “Clean Air” among others in too much bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic submission, sending invoices by post, possible sampling checks.
This would improve the operation", says Mayor of Lidzbark Warmi<0xC5><0x84>ski Jacek Wi<0xC5><0x9B>niowski.
The activists of the Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year of the operation, less than 1% of the established goal of the exchange of 3 million hanging boilers was achieved.
As Rz notes, although the budget of the program is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion annually, this amount is virtual.
“In the budget of the National Fund for the Protection of the Environment and the Water Economy for this year, PLN 1.4 billion has been reserved,” we read.
Congress approves F-35 for Poland
L<0xC3><0xA6>szczak: Now price negotiations
The U.S. Congress approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps ahead of the contract, but not the end of our work,” Mariusz Blászczak wrote on Twitter.
“We will be negotiating hard to achieve the best possible price,” the Polish minister added.
Agreement with the Polish F-35
The Polish Air Force has a target of 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by the Lockheed Martin Group.
In mid-September, the US State Department agreed to sell them to Poland.
The statement stressed that the investment will support the national security and foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of the NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland will pay <0x24>6.5 billion for the fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, the provision of engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of logistics and program support and staff training.
The Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lightning II, produced by Lockheed Martin, is a 5th-generation multipurpose single-engine fighter.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out missions of close support, bombardment and typically fighter air combat missions.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for near-range radars.
The F-35 was recently purchased by Belgium under a <0x24>4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16s.
Other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, should also consider the purchase of U.S. warplanes.
Barbie vs. stereotypes.
Gender dolls
Producer Barbie has launched a series of sex-neutral dolls.
He wants to fight stereotypes in this way.
Producer Barbie has launched a series of sex-neutral dolls
Alongside Barbie with different colors of skin, figures or hairstyles, Mattel introduced gender-neutral dolls for sale.
Toys from the "Creable World" series wear wigs.
Therefore, children can decide whether their Barbie should have short or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both pants and dresses.
In the blink of an eye dolls can with girls become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
They also renounced the emphasis on the characteristic sexual characteristics – gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long thighs and thin waist or – in the case of Ken – wide arms.
The company believes that children do not like when their dolls have imposed sexual norms, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with a specific gender inhibit the ambitions of girls and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,” Mattel announces.
Barbie's doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in bathing suits and high heels, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes", such as the unnatural proportion of the body.
The group responded to the criticism and has already introduced dolls with different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in Hyderabad.
Zandberg: round or club together may have several dozen members
Zandberg asked on the ZET radio how many candidates of his party can get to the Sejm from a letter of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the letter starts candidates to the Sejm SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo "Left"), answered that the result would be cumulative.
“I believe that the result of Left will be very good, because we feel that people are bound to hope that Left is not only right, but also strong,” he said.
According to Zandberg, the left may have between 60 and 80 deputies.
“This may mean that the circle or club together will have dozens of members.
But it depends on the Poles and the Poles.
I'm not going to guess and tell you how it's going to happen," he said.
Asked if the Left together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think the Polish people have rewarded this diversity because we have shown that by differentiating, we have been able to agree on a common program.”
Asked if the biggest beneficiary of the joint venture is SLD leader W<0xC5><0x82>odzimierz Czarzasta, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are the centre-left and left-wing voters.
In turn, considering that the SLD would receive the full subsidy, he replied that “the political party’s goal is to represent its voters.”
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the Sejm elections.
In the event of a Senate election, he said he was considering it.
"The offer is diverse and in this offer there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further," he said.
“I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in Senate District 44, I would have taken the electoral certificate and voted in another district,” he said.
“I don’t think I’d be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (candidate of the KO – PAP),” he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, the leader of the RP Citizens Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS start.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa opens
Tens of thousands of people from across Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday to inaugurate a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by bus, car and foot in Bopp district, where a new mosque could accommodate 30,000 believers.
The building was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, which belongs to the suffrage of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wetland of six hectares, handed over by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan mosque (“Roads to Paradise”) derives from the title of the poem by the Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the founder of the 19th century fraternity, venerated by believers as saints.
The mosque is enclosed with Carrara marble and has five minarets.
The tallest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque in the middle can accommodate 15,000 faithful, and the second can be so much on the outer terrace.
In richly finished interiors you can admire the golden dome, giant chandeliers and decorations hand-made by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the municipalities still have no comparison to the mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105 thousand faithful.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.
In addition to land, the government has funded lighting, sanitation and roadworks worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.5 million.
Coach Smy<0xC5><0x82>a: Our problem is not Silesia, but we ourselves
After eight league matches without a win, the Korona players will try to stop in a Friday meeting with the vice-chairman of the extra-class Silesia.
“Our problem is not the revocation, but we ourselves, we have to work on what we are playing,” said coach Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Smy<0xC5><0x82>a.
The players of the Crown last and so far the only victory in the league recorded in the first row, when they defeated 1-0 Benyamin of the Czestochowa Cancer games on the exit.
They later scored two rebounds and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to Zag<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>bi Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I am optimistic that in the last few seconds of the football game the players fought for the goal, they wanted to resign.
Their fall to the wall after the last whistle didn’t result from a breakdown, it was just a fall of anger because they were so close,” Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
As he noted, <0xC5><0x9A>l<0xC4><0x85>sk has very strong wings, which is why he will be sensitive to the team playing in the side sectors of the pitch.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also watching what we want to play," he added.
In the Friday match in Korona, he will certainly not play the Ognjen Gnjatic, the injured Jakub <0xC5><0xBB>ubrowski and Michael Gardawski will also be missing in the frame.
The constructive one is the registration in the cup match of several players with the will of the game.
“We have a headache, it just seemed to be gone, and now it is,” Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
Crown Defender Daniel Dzivniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the pass of eight league games in a row without winning, while in the extra class anyone can win with anyone.
“We are a good team.
“We may not show it on the pitch in the last few weeks, but the moment will come when we will win and we believe it will be Friday,” he said.
After nine rows, the Korona extra class with a five-point set occupies 15th place.
<0xC5><0x9A>l<0xC4><0x85>sk has collected 12 more and is ranked second.
Friday's game in Kielca will start at 20:30.
These trees could be completely extinct from Europe.
“42% of the species of trees that make up Europe’s trunk are at risk,” the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warned in the “Red Book of European Trees” published on Friday.
At the top of the list are, among other things, chestnuts and herbivores.
IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.
It was developed by experts who, based on research, concluded that out of 454 species of trees found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world), 42% are “highly endangered”.
Among the causes, the Red Book lists the rapid growth of urban agglomeration and global climate change.
However, these trees and shrubs, which occur only or mainly on our continent, are most at risk.
According to experts from the IUCN, 58% of species are at risk of extinction, and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the exploitation of the timber, accelerated urbanization, too intensive cutting of trees, and, more importantly, fires of forests and changes taking place in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and pores is also strongly threatened.
“The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual extinction of European plant species and pose a risk of extinction in Europe of the important and undervalued varieties that are the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet’s biosphere”, summarized the UC.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I don't promise 600<0x2B>
“Today PiS wants to buy back the Poles, offering them a free distribution on the loan, which will have to be paid by future generations,” says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with “Rzeczpospolita”.
In his opinion, “the whole politics of PiS is a pic.”
At the same time, politicians promise that “what is given will not be banned.”
Schetyna assures in a conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea of defeating Law and Justice.
It is about the mobilization of the electorate in the polling stations.
According to him, the opposition has more potential in this regard than Kaczynski’s party.
“Today, the conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than the supporters of PiS, a party that has rebelled against declared values such as modesty, humility, transparency,” she said.
The leader of the Citizens’ Coalition and the Chairman of the Citizens’ Platform also highlighted the basic foundations of the KO’s electoral programme.
“First of all, nothing data will be received, but it is necessary to set the direction for the future, because PiS is dealing exclusively with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it’s about “energizing Poles, helping and investing in those who work faithfully – and those who are entrepreneurs.”
Schetyna explains that the KO program included a project that would give the least earning Poles 614 PLN more per hand, and the more earnings – also a few hundred.
The politician also noted that he did not want to pursue distribution.
As he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he doesn't promise 600<0x2B>.
“I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers have auctioned with the opposition to the distribution, until finally the country’s financial collapse,” he said.
Schetyna also stated in an interview for "Rz" that Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Malgorzata Kidaw-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“We would exploit their hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.
“Pythagoras walks ahead of the fall.
Kaczynski is a man of the state like Bana<0xC5><0x9B> is crystalline,” he added.
The CEO also said that he has not yet decided whether to apply for the Platform’s leadership.
Argentina: Six Great Condors Dead
In the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, six large condors have been found dead, according to TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
Large condoms have probably been poisoned by means of killing predators such as pigeons, foxes or wild dogs.
Animals could have eaten toxic debris.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were grown up.
“This is a great loss for the environment, because the condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and reproductive.
So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
“I think the use of toxic and poisonous cravings puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health,” he added.
"Rz": They want a jewelry for the president
Work has begun on the awarding of the Head of State of the Precious Chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Dudy’s office – we read in “Rzeczpospolite”.
According to the newspaper, it is the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insygnium officially called the interwar jewel of the Republic of Poland.
The last time it was used was probably by President Ignacy Mo<0xC5><0x9B>cicki.
“Rz” says that soon such a chain could hit the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the rule of law and the Petition voted on Wednesday on a proposal to take action on a revised law on orders and awards to restore it.
The newspaper notes that this is also not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it passed by one vote.
This time, the work is urgent.
At the beginning of August, the senators spent a few minutes on the matter, recognizing that they would reach the President’s office’s opinion.
It came in mid-September.
“I am pleased to inform that the office of the President of the Republic of Croatia does not comment on the position presented in the petition in question,” Presidential Minister Andrzej Dera wrote at the time.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the matter and again devoted little time to the matter.
“The President’s office answered us briefly: it’s in favour of restoring it,” said commissioner Robert Mammatow of PiS, quoted by Rz.
He submitted a request for legislative action, which the committee supported.
Police will teach drivers how to ride through the crossroads
The political action will be carried out, among other things, at the crossing of al. Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>ski with al. Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski.
Uniform activities have something to do with the recent complaints from the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the crossroads.
On Friday, September 27, the police are launching preventive actions “Crossovers” in Rzeszow.
It is about eliminating traffic obstructions: entering at a crossroads without the possibility of going, not being used for light signals or road signs.
“We often think we’re alone at the crossroads, and we’re really making life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobi<0xC5><0x84>ski, the city’s vice president, a few days ago.
His words sounded at a press conference of the city council, at which the city authorities presented examples of improper movement of cars after the crossings, which in effect forms corks.
At the time, the president appealed to travellers for reason on the road and, among other things, faster movement on the lights or not to write texts while driving.
The topic was somewhat taken over by the Rzeszów policemen, who are starting today the campaign “Crossovers”.
What's the matter?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting the crossings by drivers entering it without the possibility of continuing the journey.
This is a frequent violation that contributes to the potency of movement obstructions and the formation of hips.
It is threatened with a mandate of PLN 300 and 2 penalties.
In addition, the uniform will pay attention to the inappropriate use of light signals or road signs and irregular parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe a lack of driving fluidity, late movement from the signals, free crossings and leaving too long distances between the vehicles.
On what crossroads will the action be carried out?
M.in. on ul. Lisa-Kula from Jagiellonian ul.; al. Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>ski from al. Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski; Targowo ul. from al. Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski; Square of <0xC5><0x9A>reniavitov from D<0xC4><0x85>browski ul. or Hetman ul. from al. Warsaw Uprisings.
This type of action in the capital of Podkarpaci will be held on the next Friday of October.
They checked the company that eradicates waste from "Cjajki"
“Officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the City Hall of Wolomi<0xC5><0x84>skie County and the Municipal Inspectorate of Construction Supervision checked on Friday the installation in the municipality of Zelonka, in which waste from the “Czaj<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>skie” waste treatment plant in Warsaw, Kar<0xC5><0x82>omi<0xC5><0x84>ski, Poland.
Inspectors from Wolominski's mayoral office carried out inspections at the plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
The private Trade-Transport Plant “Dar-Trans”, under the agreement with the municipal waste treatment plant “Czajka”, provides waste management services.
“In addition, installation inspections were made, and the company was asked to provide documentation related to the activities carried out by it,” Szyszko said.
He added that the inspection report will be transmitted, inter alia, to the Voivodeship Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The last inspection in “Dar-Transi” was carried out by the Voivodeship Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw between December 29, 2015 and February 11, 2016.
It was established at that time that the company did not take samples, measurements and groundwater tests, nor did it have the results of stabilized municipal sewerage testing from the “Cjajka” sewage treatment plant.
After the inspection of the WTO, Dariusz Sabata was called upon to stop violating the terms of the decision.
“DAR-TRANS” Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewers from the “Cjajka” treatment plant.
According to the decision to dispose of waste in the production area, waste up to 60 000 tonnes per year is treated in the forests around Zelonka.
The Warsaw City Water Supply and Sewerage Company reported last Thursday that at the break of November and December 2018 STUO<0xC5><0x9B> was excluded from operation, which was related to damage to one of the combustion equipment.
According to MPWiK, their monthly export cost is 1.7 million PLN (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa supported Malgorzata Kidaw-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“You have undergone a difficult task, you can count on my full support,” Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa told Kidawy-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska Malgorzata on Friday.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me,” said the candidate of the Civil Coalition to the prime minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, it is now “only a retirement fan”.
Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska met on Friday with former President Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk.
In a short conversation behind closed doors, the son of Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa – Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw also took part.
“You have had a difficult task,” he said after the meeting with Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>s.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
“The problems before Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, there is great hope that you as a woman will cope with these problems, and we all – those who love Poland – will be able to support your actions to the fullest,” the former president said, addressing Kidawy-Blo<0xC5><0x84>ska.
Very Important Words
Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska thanked him for his support.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution, and you know how important that is,” she said.
“Let us show that we can do a different, wise policy together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
This is how the Lord has done his revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland,” Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said.
Kibic in retirement
Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa said in an interview with reporters that he is now "only a retired fan".
“Of course I’m looking at that.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, tested, we will return.
The tripartition of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are essential.
And all this needs to be cleaned up, all this needs to be restored to normal action, and I believe this time we will do it.
Because if not, the street criterion is waiting for us,” Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa said.
“That’s why it’s so important for the Poles to go to the elections, to think and make a decision on their own.
And that’s the most important thing,” Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said.
“The last chance is that by card we will improve the state of things in Poland,” the former president replied.
“We need to build a new foundation.”
Asked about the most important changes for her in Poland, Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said: “The President said very well.
We need to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since the tripartite power does not exist, because the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it clear and let everyone know that otherwise Poland will not take a step forward.”
ME goalkeepers: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semi-finals.
On the hot terrain in Ljubljana, the Polish goalkeepers struggled with the Slovenes in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
There was no lack of controversy and discussion with the judges, with Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
"White-Red" lost 1-3 and will play for the bronze medal.
The Senate has decided on key laws.
The Senate passed the law without amendments on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials and on the flights of the most important persons in the state.
In favour of the revised law on the property of the families of state officials – without amendments – 52 senators voted, 14 voted against and three abstained.
The senators therefore decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during the debate on Wednesday by Senator S<0xC5><0x82>awomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were to “civilize” and limit the scope of the information provided in the statement on the property situation of their own children, the children of the spouse, the children adapted to the cases in which the children remain in a common household with the person obliged to.
The law on the transparency of the property of the families of the most important state officials, the draft of which was created in the prime minister’s office, was adopted by the Sejm on September 11.
The provisions assume that, among other things, the prime ministers, ministers, Members of the European Parliament, senators, presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as the heads of other state institutions, will be obliged to inform the authorities of the placement.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the Flight Act of the most important people in the country.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft along with the most important persons in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for the operation of the Central Flight Registry.
There were 55 senators in favour of the bill, 12 against and four with no vote.
According to the law, each flight of the president will be a flight "exercised in an official mission".
During the presidency, members of the family and other persons invited by the president will be able to accompany.
The flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will only be carried out in order to carry out tasks directly related to the function.
The law also specifies a list of people who can accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations, members of the delegation may be on board – invited members, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational services; and journalists.
According to the law, in case of doubts about the flights of the Sejm and Senate marshals, the head of the KPRM will be asked to explain them.
If such doubts are not resolved within the specified timeframe, the head of the KPRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the Sejm or Senate office of the failure to organise such a flight.
The new Sports Officer
Waldemar Paluch appointed his Deputy for Physical Culture, Sports and Tourism.
Artur <0xC5><0x9A>wi<0xC4><0x9B>tek, a long-time president of the PWSTE Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw University Club, was the director of the Rector’s Office of the University of Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw for the last 4 years.
Bart<0xC5><0x82>omiaj Pacek Artur <0xC5><0x9A>wi<0xC4><0x9B>tek was recently strongly involved in the project of reactivation of basketball in Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Artur <0xC5><0x9A>wi<0xC4><0x9B>tek is not an anonymous figure in the Yaroslavl sports environment.
A graduate of the Academy of Physical Education in Bia<0xC5><0x82>a Podla<0xC5><0x84>ska since 2002 has been an instructor at the State University of Technical and Economics in Yaroslavl, and has been serving as president for 15 years.
After the first training in Paris, the Poles are waiting for their last rival.
The Polish goalkeepers held their first training session in Paris on Friday, where they will play in a bronze medal match on Saturday.
Vital Heynen closed the road to winning the title on Thursday with the Slovenians 1:3 in Ljubljana.
There were rumors about their problems with the trip to this duo.
This time it happened without such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovenes charter to Paris, and a few hours later they did training in the famous Bercy Hall.
According to the relationship of the people present at the classes, the world champions' coach was under-nerved.
As Heynen’s assistant Micha<0xC5><0x82> Mieszko Gogol noted, this time the main task was not the exercise of the mesh elements itself.
“We went to the hall, but for the vast majority it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time with him than training.
To talk, to think about how to rebuild all this as a team,” he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We were brutally brought to the ground.
Without two opinions, we are disappointed.
We still thought we would go back to this game.
We discussed this game with each other in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main causes of the failure, I would point out the inefficiency of an attack and much worse than the usual handling of the situational balls.
The Slovenes were much better than us in this regard,” he analyzed.
According to him, "White-Red" did not put stress on the obstacle, associated with the performance against the loud and numerous audiences of the tournament co-hosts.
He admitted that the world champions could sleep a little smoothly on the way to the semi-finals.
“Perhaps if we had a similar failure in the group stage, we would have analyzed this lesson more quickly and then we would have played in the next stage of the tournament.
“It’s just a bitch,” he warned.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday’s defeat will result in aggression in the bronze match.
“I hope that we will show you our true face.
There's something to fight for.
The last time we won the ME medal was in 2011,” he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by the Poles during these championships.
In the group stage, they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, went to Apeldoorn for the first two meetings of the group stage and moved to Ljubljana for the semi-finals.
Nick Kyrgios: Severe but Suspended Punishment
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban from startups and a <0x24>25,000 fine – in a six-month suspension – for deliberate words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour players lose patience with Kyrgios, but still give him a chance to improve.
Summary of the crimes of the most unruly professional tennis player in recent years looks threatening – 16 weeks of breaks plus a lot of fines, but both penalties are suspended for half a year – a trial period in which a rogue athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he’s been doing it for a long time and has earned his own tennis world record – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on the card and next to it.
Loud curses, strange gestures, non-sports behavior, insulting the judge and viewers, breaking two rockets during a losing match with Karen Chaczan – all for that after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati, he paid <0x24>113,000.
At the US Open in 2019, he did not play long, but he was able to publicly say that ATP activists “are corrupted”, which hurt the organization’s authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgyzstan and after a few weeks filed the aforementioned verdict on the launch and suspension.
However, the words about corruption were forgiven, after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
However, in their justification, tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgios’ behaviour over the past 12 months has in many cases raised serious reservations and constituted a nearly continuous violation of the rules, that he has consistently violated the rules, volcanoes, and volcanoes.
However, ATP has given him five days to make a public appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering the fulfillment of several conditions in the next six months: in the tournaments of the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Kyrgios can no longer be disturbed, can no longer be disturbed, can no longer violate the rule of law.
He was also advised to seek “continuous support” from mental coaches during the tournaments and also outside the season to consult with people who specialize in solving the problems of athletes who do not cope with proper behavior.
The first comment (on social media) by Nick Kyrgios to the verdict was: "Hey everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that’s all.”
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break, as in the Lavera Cup, his bowel injury worsened, so he had to give up on the upcoming starts in Beijing (September 30 – October 6) and Shanghai (6–January 13).
Kyrgios is ranked 27th in the ATP rankings.
He won two tournaments this year – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than <0x24>1.3 million, so even after the penalties, he will have a lot left.
GUS: Life is getting better in Poland
A report published by GUS on household budgets on Friday shows that as good or rather good, up to 44% of households assessed their material situation.
This percentage was 37.2 per cent in the previous year, 33.5 per cent in 2016, and never exceeded 30 per cent in the previous year, since the Statistical Office first examined the subjective estimates of the situation of households.
In the U.S., 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The best is the material situation of households working on their own.
In this group, 70 percent of respondents consider it good or rather good.
On the second pole are households of ranchers, where the percentage of such responses was only 18 per cent.
The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also largely influenced by the number of children.
The worst-known parent is a single-parent offspring, of whom 32% declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among homeless households, 48.8 percent.
In these statistics, the effect of the 500<0x2B> program is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016) their worst material situation was assessed by parents who were single-parents and multi-family families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid increase in income, especially from work.
This is not all, however, because the percentage of households who consider their situation to be good is increasing faster than real incomes.
Moreover, at the provincial level, there is no clear relationship between income level and assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best ratings are formulated by the residents of the Opolskie Voivodeship, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
The provinces of Ljubljana (47.7 per cent), Silesia (47.6 per cent), Masovian (47.3 per cent) and Western Pomerania (47.1 per cent).
Meanwhile, in Poland, the administrative income (i.e. after payment of taxes and contributions) amounted to less than 94 per cent of the national average, and in Lubusk 98 per cent.
The highest incomes were Mazowiecki (120 per cent of the national average) and Silesian (104 per cent).
On average, in Poland, the administrative income per person was PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after the adjustment of the effect of price changes) it increased by 4.3 per cent compared to 2017.
In recent years, the result is quite low.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
Although the increase in income is slowing down, it also inhibits the increase in spending.
These in conversion per person amounted to PLN 1187, which means that in real terms, they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9 per cent and in 2016 by 4.3 per cent.
Research on household budgets suggests that the statistical household currently spends 70.1 percent of its administrative income, while in 2014 it exceeded 80 percent, and by 2006 it exceeded 90 percent.

U.S.: Three Suicides Among Aircraft Crews
Three sailors committed suicide on board the USS George H. W. Bush last week, the U.S. Navy said.
Over the past two years, a total of five crew members of the ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year, and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors were shot dead last week.
Each of the incidents occurred on land when USS George H. W. Bush was smuggling off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the involvement of third parties has been excluded.
In addition, deaths should not be related to each other.
“We need everyone to be involved in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
“I want to stress that there is no stigmatization or other repercussions related to seeking help,” Sean Bailey, the ship’s captain, wrote on Facebook.
Neesio<0xC5><0x84>ski criticised the pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
“In fact, every opinion of him was accepted.”
Later, there was a criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activity of Risk is a great shadow of his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – the pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best of the life of the Pope of Poland,” he explained.
The former PO confessed: “There were blindness of dissatisfaction, the pope said something he once did not accept Risk, but he had power and as a politician he could simply throw it out of the Church or send the runners on a mission to New Caledonia, to take it from Fiji, or from Fiji.
However, John Paul II did not do so, as did his successors,” Niesiowski explained.
“In addition, this fatal case of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, and in fact their absence, has occurred.
I ran a bit forward thinking, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole shape of his life.
We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church since relatively recently.
The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things,” Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski said.
In the assessment of the former PO Polish policy, the Church is an ally of PiS.
“It must be admitted that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the holy Mass, the crosses hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of a dictatorship – a sign of a written regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzik tremble at the Polish Church, that John Paul II has done nothing about it, and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which the elephant will come to pay him,” Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski said.
“I hope that Pope Francis will pursue J<0xC4><0x99>draszewski, Risk and a few others of this type,” he said.
HRUBIESZ<0xC3><0x96>W: Tomorrow is the 590th anniversary of the county

PZPN sleeps behind bars in stadiums.
Gryf disqualified
The start of the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechi Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk with small hair did not end tragically when the goalkeeper of the opposition team, Zlatana Alomerovic, was fired by the Kibbits from Wejhero Raca by a millimeter.
After the incident, the game was interrupted for 20 minutes.
Investigating this case, the PZPN commission measured Gryff a harsh penalty, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed in the next match at their own stadium.
They will also not be able to go in groups for league matches until December 31.
Burdy at the Widzewa <0xC5><0x81>ód<0xC5><0xBA> stadium was also invoked by fans of <0xC5><0x9A>l<0xC4><0x85>ska Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Here, however, the PZPN’s verdict was milder, because <0xC5><0x9A>l<0xC4><0x85>sk predicted that similar events could occur and felt the appropriate authorities in this matter.
Despite this, the services allowed to throw away the boot squirrels sector by racing, burning chairs and forging the host sector.
The match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a waterarm.
PZPN penalized <0xC5><0x9A>l<0xC4><0x85>sk with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to the matches in this and the next edition of the PP.
The ban also covered the Ekstraklassy league games, but it will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to exchange markings across its managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
The implementation of the update of the Ministry of Infrastructure Regulation on, among other things, the registration of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish has begun.
For example, "Lion" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our province, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it should be easier, more readable and easier.
The new guidelines stem from the update of the Infrastructure Minister’s Regulation on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
“We should keep in mind that the names of the villages in the neighbouring countries often also have Polish sounds.
Thanks to the change we have prepared, they will finally appear on the roads along our roads.
The introduction of the new marking will begin with the sub-karpace section of the A4 motorway," said Infrastructure Minister Andrzej Adamczyk.
At Podkarpaci, the changes will be made on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The total cost of investment?
200,000 PLN.
First of all, the new designation will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is scheduled for November 1, 2019.
What does the realization of the idea look like?
It will work without changing boards, basically stickers.
They will replace the current working names of the new villages, written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be written in one verse – first in Polish, then in the original, instead.
This will be a great relief for those who do not know the spelling names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a spider from the windshield
In the pond in Zame<0xC4><0x8D>ka, in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a weakling having problems with the wings.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had set up a target from the animal – in his body, a slurry from the wind turbine was found.
“Information about the injured bird was received from the villagers of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Center in New Sole.
According to the report, the animal had broken wings.
We got to the place.
It was immediately apparent that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so that we did not hurt him and did not expose him to additional stress.
The lizard was caught and hanged at the veterinarian.
After the first RTG shot, it was already known that someone had made him a shooter.
In his body there were fragments of the screw,” says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, which manages the rehabilitation centre, among other things.
Overwinters in the center
"The wounds have been cleaned, the birds have been given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the center where they will spend all winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He's not able to fly yet.
Releasing him now would be linked to the fact that he would most likely not survive the winter,” added Walasek.
After undergoing rehabilitation, the staff intends to release him to the same pond in the spring.
The authorities of the municipality of <0xC5><0xBB>ukowice, after receiving information about the cause of the poor animal health, intend to inform the prosecutor about the case.
The event took place in Zame<0xC4><0x8D>ka
Gowin: “We need to stimulate Polish, small trade”
“The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, you will need to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” said on Friday the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Goro<0xC5><0x82>aw, leader of the Agreement.
Gowin said during an interview in "Signals of the Day" on the radio that trade is controlled by international networks, which impose so low margins on Polish producers that actually Polish companies cannot develop.
Considering that it is very difficult to deal with this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister reminded that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term, but received “the opposition from the EC”.
“We have won before the Court of Justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and forms a government, we will come back to this issue,” he said.
At the same time, he noted that "the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and therefore small trade".
“It will be necessary to consider whether the government or the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.
In May, the EU court ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake in acknowledging that the Polish retail tax was not permitted by public aid.
The Retail Tax Act required the introduction of two trade tax rates: 0.8 per cent of the revenue between 17 million and 170 million zlotys per month and 1.4 per cent of the revenue above 170 million zlotys per month.
The tax has been in force since September 2016.
In September 2016, the European Commission initiated a procedure for infringement of EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued at the time that the construction of the tax could favor smaller stores, which could be considered public aid.
She then stated that the dana was put into effect in an unlawful manner.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until its analysis by officials in Brussels was completed.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May decision of the EU court opened the way for a re-introduction of the tax, but did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission brought an appeal before the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TSUE press service reported to the PAP that the matter is currently at a written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not known at this time whether or not the oral procedure is initiated, i.e. hearing the parties and a possible hearing.
You need a good few to dozens of months from the date of the appeal to the announcement of the judgment.
“This procedure lasts an average year,” said a PAP source at the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
How to Dress a Child for Baptism?
We provide a number of practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the baby and his parents.
Often it is the first time that the whole family focuses around the child, celebrating together his apparition in the world.
So it’s no wonder that the freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look as good as possible on this day.
However, before you and you make the final decision as to your child’s outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In the shops you can find many sets of clothing, which do not provide the child with proper comfort.
What, then, should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing a dress for baptism is the age of the child
Even until recently, small ones were baptized several weeks ago, arranged in white sets and inserted into the same bells or large pads.
Today, children approaching the sacrament are often older: several months old, year old, and even older.
It is easy to imagine that such great comfort already needs a little bit of other clothing for baptism.
Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he or she will probably spend the ceremony in a cart or at the hands of his or her parents or a Christian.
The best option will be to decorate it in comfortable, cotton stools or sets.
Although this element of the wardrobe is considered to be a everyday garment, it is enough to look for its sacred variants, for example with a sofa or a crown.
For the boy, it will be perfect for the points with the print of mouse and veils.
In the case of older children, you can afford to have more fantasy in the wardrobe.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, tidy dress
Many parents of lazy girls look to the side of richly decorated, foldable wedding dresses with coats, belts and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers use artificial, non-inflammatory materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
Looking for the right outfit, it is better to take a look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate, tidy skirts, satin dresses, jeans, apps and cute sets will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.
The ideal outfit for a small gentleman: cotton garniture
Until recently, there was fashion among the boys’ parents for clothing that was a copy of “adult” models.
Polyester mariners and pants, stiff collars or caskets often made young elegance loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they were outfitted with comfortable, cotton sets.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, that is, soft, dress pants, and a blouse decorated in front of the jacket pattern.
These machines look incredibly sacred, and at the same time do not twist the movements of a child's world.
Krystyna Paw<0xC5><0x82>owicz has published a property statement
Krystyna Paw<0xC5><0x82>owicz filed a property statement at the end of the term.
It turns out that the PiS MEP accumulated PLN 110,000 savings.
Let’s remember that Pawlowicz announced his departure from politics.
At the end of the term of office, it has an amount of PLN 110 thousand
As follows from the statement made by the deputy, she will take a monthly pension worth 4.7 thousand z<0xC5><0x82>.

Voting on a pause in the proceedings of the Conservative Party conference
British parliamentarians voted against a three-day pause in the House of Commons talks during the annual Conservative Party programme conference, which the government has requested.
There were 289 votes in favour and 306 against.
Usually, the House of Commons does not discuss during party conferences, so that members do not have to give up either their participation in them or their parliamentary meetings.
However, opposition parties have agreed that at such a crucial time as are the last weeks before Britain’s planned exit from the European Union on October 31, parliament should not be interrupted.
In support of the government's request for a break, 289 MEPs voted against 306.
Two opposition parties have already signed the conventions.
The lack of consent to a break can be taken as the political revenge of the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the Supreme Court found the decision to be unlawful and unconstitutional) and for the fact that he will not be asking for a pardon for his death.
After that decision, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson’s speech and the subsequent stormy debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding preterm elections.
“It’s time for Brexit.
It needs to be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit must come in order for us to deal with the priorities of citizens, the health care, the cost of living.
“Brexit needs to be realised so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is set to begin in Manchester next Sunday and will last until Wednesday, October 2.
The conferences of two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of Johnson’s justifications for explaining such a long suspension of parliament was party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda accuses Israel of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a response to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” the foreign media wrote.
The President’s spokesman strongly denied these reports.
"It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter, Blazej Spychalski.
Israeli media, including "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post", referring to "Jewish Insider", write that during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the RP Consulate in New York, Andrzej Duda stated that Israel bears the blame for the last anti-Semitic Poles.
The president said the rise of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israel’s Foreign Minister Katz, who said in February that “the Poles sucked out anti-Semitism with mother’s milk.”
Andrzej Duda said he regrets that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating statements made by its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression on the Polish ambassador to Israel Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted, "Poland, Poland".
“The quote is not just inaccurate.
It’s simply not true,” he wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel was responsible for the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland."
According to Spychalski, the portal “invented it.”
According to JI interviewers, there was also a dispute during the meeting between Holocaust survivor Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, who was awarded the Order of Merit of the RP Commander Cross.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda’s words and say that the Jews of Israel “like Israel Kac” are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to sources on the portal, Boteach was to stop Mosberg's speech.
Who is Bana<0xC5><0x9B> and what did he blame?
The stonework rented by the smugglers led the journalist to the discovery of negligence in the property statements of Marian Banasio.
Let’s summarize another affair that shocked the camp’s rulers.
TVN’s “Supervisor” journalists have revealed that Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B>, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not written into the statement of the 400-metre stone quarry, which is located on the Krakow Mountains, in recent years.
What’s more, his tenant had to drive in the aforementioned sex business stone (and therefore rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself has been a guarantee of repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel drew attention to the irregularities in the program "Supervisor".
The journalist revealed that Banasia was rented by people associated with the criminal world to use it as a place for "erotic meetings".
Clients were supposed to be men who used the services of prostitutes.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> answered the allegations vaguely and sternly.
Interestingly, the stoneworks rented led the journalist to the discovery of negligence in Banasia’s property statements.
The stone itself was unclearly described in them, and the income from her rent was to be degraded.
“The property of Marian Banasia and his wife can be worth between PLN 6 and PLN 8 million.
In total, spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...],” writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia stone itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office is currently in control of Marian Banasia’s property statements for the years 2015–2019.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> announced that he would suspend his activities at NIK until it was completed. “I will go to your free vacation marshals,” he said.
The opposition demands clarification.
“We don’t hear that the CBA is expanding its investigation or accelerating the investigation of Marian Banasio’s property claims.
That is why we are forced to convict the authorities of the state and to make a notification of the possibility of committing the crime [...]”, - said MP Mariusz Witczak.
“If the normal Pole were to underestimate the lease of his real estate, he would already have 10 controls, a tax rate and a criminal-tax procedure,” he added.
He went high, he fell low
Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B> is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
He was appointed to this position on 30 August 2019, for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was announced by Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party were accepted.
Previously, Bana<0xC5><0x9B> was associated with NIK from 1992 to 2005, he worked in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski.
During the first PiS governments (2005–2008), Bana<0xC5><0x9B> held the position of President of the Customs Service and also Deputy Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015 he has again sat on the chair of the Head of Customs Service, and since 2017 he has been managing the National Tax Administration.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> served as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki for three months.

"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the command of the policeman will be punished
According to the newspaper, the failure to comply with a specific order of conduct issued by a police officer is intended to be a new type of violation, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.
The police unions want to make such a change.
The idea came to the Senate Committee on Petitions.
“The case is serious, because now more than half a million criminal cases are brought to the Polish courts every year,” the statement reads.
The “Rzeczpospolita” established that the petition, which the Independent Union of Politicians writes to MPs on the amendment of the Code of Violations, has a chance of success.
The authors of the petition propose a new amendment to Article 54a of the Code of Violations.
It should read: “Anyone who does not submit to the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law, is subject to a penalty of arrest, a fine or a restriction of liberty.”
“Paragraph 3 of this provision refers to the same punishment for those who, by not performing orders, will prevent or hinder the performance of a business activity,” the journal states.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpospolitej" that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal for the regulation, he fears that if implemented, it can be used in political issues of demonstrations.
“In the case of free demonstrations, it would be unfavourable and, instead of alleviating the situation, it would be exacerbated,” she added.
Statistics from the newspaper show that 86 per cent of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that 1.5 million interventions in the city are undertaken each month.
Buras is worried about Europe
Jáchym Topol's writing is in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today mentioned in a row with Václav Havl.
From the beginning, therefore, the curse of the talent that Jáchym was trying to exploit.
Eight years later, he returned with "The Sensitive Man."
The heroes are Buras and So<0xC5><0x88>a along with their two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They are travelling actors, they travel around Europe.
He is a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound from himself, and for the second time he stopped in the time of infants.
But these are not the heroes that are the most important in this story.
All of them are just a background for observing a world where there is no longer room for artistic homeowners.
It’s a world of busy provinces, old society of suspicious people and disillusioned youth.
The “sensitive man” places turns into an absurd theatrical.
The narrative imitates didaskalia, and the conversations of the heroes create this world.
The scene is Europe full of concerns about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancels 105 flights due to Thomas Cook bankruptcy
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has fallen, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann operates.
The company, however, has problems.
According to VRT, Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All departures with an office that have been booked in Belgium will be canceled, but in time they will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Ghent also announced the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgian people are abroad on trips purchased by Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Leen Segers, a spokeswoman for the Belgian company, said the company is currently “completely operational” despite the announcement of a bankruptcy by the British company, a mother that caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then agreed that the customers who purchased the tours in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the world’s largest travel agencies – announced the fall in the night from Sunday to Monday.
The direct cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse on Sunday of last chance talks with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors demanded that in addition to the <0xC2><0xA3>900 million bailout plan already agreed in August, the company gained an additional <0xC2><0xA3>200 million as a guarantee for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnovers.
However, the company’s problems have grown over the years, resulting in a debt of <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation in a review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – this extraordinary offer has been prepared by the German Görlitz for the future.
The activities are designed to help in the fight against the gradual decline in the population of the city.
Görlitz is the most east-facing city in Germany.
The beautiful pastel town attracts 140 thousand tourists a year.
However, as The Guardian writes, the city is struggling with significant problems.
In Görlitz there are the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a permanent population loss.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them went to the west of the country, resulting in a 25 percent decline in the city’s population.
In 2013, it numbered 54,000 people.
In order to combat the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 proposals have been reached.
Two-thirds of them were built by residents of large cities.
The program also interested people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
“When we applied, we thought the program was meant to convince people to move to Görlitz,” said one of the project participants.
"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we're staying here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has 7,000 vacancies, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the whole country.
While the city authorities hope that some will move on to a permanent, the main goal of the program is to get the opinion of the participants.
The information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
“We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what was their motivation,” said Robert Knippschild, the program’s director.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first of these was Detroit, which introduced a pay program promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candelaria in Italy, or in the American Tulsa in Oklahoma.
