Obama welcomes Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s ongoing settlement construction and denounces Netanyahu’s lack of will in the peace process.
Obama’s deal with Iran’s nuclear program has further deteriorated the relationship between the two countries.
In March, Netanyahu held a controversial speech in front of the U.S. Congress at the invitation of the Republicans, which was partly regarded as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to his upcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a slightly shy voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" is still alive and probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was cricketed on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to do it backwards, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who's ever been in love with me, and she's the only woman who's ever been in love with me."
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school ground, where, according to police, he had a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office, and reached the office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made the devastating emergency call sometime afterwards.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police stabbed him.
One day after the university shooting, which forced students and faculty members to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lesson.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave for health reasons, saying that he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Latest changes to the University’s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee for him an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from the campus, the police later found Lamb's footprint when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent's house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Colonel Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with approximately 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He graduated in the spring in pedagogy.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing for a few years.
At the time, he was the female swarm.
All the girls melted when he was there," said Hairston, now 40, who lives in the suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no evidence of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the backstone house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Stone, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Stone said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer year market three years ago.
Later they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night last night on September 5 after Lamb ended his guitar and oral harmonica game in front of a sparse audience.
There was no indication that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the deceased professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialised in American Native Americans and Colonial History, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the Student Committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, some 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight commemoration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the alarm clock while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The lesson will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to move our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call called Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says there won’t be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby product retailer says it will give the current employees and season workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country. In the Christmas season of 2014, another 45,000 workers were employed.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will begin application interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was professionally a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and I gradually realize that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, Back in Time.
The film begins, and it comes to mind that I’m a simulated gum and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "indisputably the biggest time travel movie ever made."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief reiterates his call on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - on the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria as they demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Survey Values That Show Donald Trump Should Be Taken Seriously
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others took it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks in polls down, it has (still) not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the two-digit area, and some are beginning to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership was given to the ascending Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump’s lasting fortune and are starting to let their dollars flow to knock him down.
Here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the property mogul positively.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthralled” or “satisfied” with Trump’s nomination.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “anxious” if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthralled” versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “irritated” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favourite, were the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombing and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to Republicans believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation’s first predecessor state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to effectively run his office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t fit into the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put up their scholarly hats, Republican voters consider Trump real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That’s a change since four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a variety of GOP voters view Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans were gathering for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the split field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University survey in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would beat the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their own opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have cast their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change their mind.
46% said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Yet Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “violent” in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration was a turning point in the 2016 public discourse.
Some are concerned that Trump’s decisive bombing of Hispanic Americans will be kept away from the Republican Party and will damage reorientation efforts.
But according to Monday’s new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do so.
Frustration over the government is climbing to new heights.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, about half of the support from Republican voters is currently lacking, mainly due to their outspoken status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday poll by ABC/Post that they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
They are also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "holy angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential neighbourhoods in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential facility - overlooking the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter of a reed roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows which special positions cost a square meter the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student booth in Munich are not really little.
However, unlike Germany’s top residential areas, one of the prices is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residences - with square meter prices in swinging heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros nix - per square meter, well noted.
Well, who can afford it...
By the way, Munich is exceptionally not at the top.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller und Götze
Double goalkeeper in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller has just one run.
A happy match by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to earn a 3-0 win at Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan".
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their start-up in the Champions League with Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.<0x2B>2) and Götts' score (89.) earned by 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth success in the series is expected to be the first step towards the finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the henkel pot to Munich in the third round.
Müller received good support from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto in his 28th Champions League match to lead the Bayern, which allowed a flanked shot of the world champion to pass.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game at Karaiskakis Stadium before 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers held their word.
They showed a focused and committed imagination without glowing.
Piraeus had won his last six home games in the Royal Class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
Borussia Dortmund (1:3).
However, the Bayern, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams undefeated, did not want to be the next victim.
They ran courageously, but in their offensive efforts, often too recklessly to work.
The attacks were too often initiated by a move to left-wing Douglas Costa, who rarely went through against former Brownsweeper Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank from the right half-field in the top-left goal.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best chances in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos stürmer Ideye Brown knocked the pole's headball off the line (26th).
Then by direct acceptance, who paired Torwart Roberto with his knee (35.).
Although the Bayern used to raise their dominant game, Piraeus was able to put needle stitches.
But on goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was abandoned.
For example, when he directed a shot of ideas over the latte (56.).
Recently, Guardiola made a four-chain defense with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did it well.
Mario Götze, after having muscle problems back in the frame, was first sitting outside.
The World Cup hero did not give green light until after the final training, sports director Matthias Sammer said at Sky: "If you want to do something different from it, it's already malicious."
Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the hit Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it clear 13 minutes later, Müller put another one on it.
Before the game, there were claws in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially obscured Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and marched with blows against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bavarian fan was injured from the stadium.
People who smoke have a higher risk of losing their teeth
Those who smoke do not only harm the lungs, but also the teeth - this is a long-term study by Potsdamer Potsdam.
The good news is that when you give up, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evidenced by the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely to 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The researchers had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasizes.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
Therefore, the relationship between smoking and tooth loss is due to more frequent tooth inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk, but within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years for the danger to fall back to non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham in England.
To convince people not to smoke, study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIfE said: “Smoking shortens life.”
Non-smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health until old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.
Earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists collide with Cologne Rheinufer on remains from the Late Antiquity
Archaeological finds have been made on the right Rhineufer in Cologne.
Near the site for the new Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-German Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum head Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called underground monuments.
For all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always added as a specialty for archaeological underground excavation.
In the third section of the Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists have now been found.
It has already been known from text documents that a fortress and a church stood on the site in the 4th century and in the 8th century, explained Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 tombs was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman from freight train caught
After a young woman was injured at the railway station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police asked the people for help.
At about 1.40 a.m. on Wednesday morning, the woman from the railway building, arriving at the end of the railway ladder, crossed the track and was caught by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
By detecting the train, she suffered the most serious injuries, according to the Federal Police.
She was treated on-site by emergency medical personnel and taken to a hospital by rescue personnel.
The investigating officer is not aware of the reason for the young woman’s nightly crossing.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Inquiry comes from residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Instructions that reveal the cause of the accident can be given by contacting the Federal Police 24 hours a day and free of charge at 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes new court in TTIP dispute
In order to deepen the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The disputed private resolution bodies for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds significantly more to traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens can trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said at the presentation.
The Swedish government intends to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in free trade talks with the United States.
The German government has announced its support.
TTIP aims to create the world’s largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically require EU states and the United States to jointly select independent judges for a new Court of Investment.
They are intended to come in equal proportions from the EU, the US and third countries.
For the first time there is also a second instance.
It would allow you to object to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators, there was no possibility to object to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long run, she wants to work on an International Investment Court according to her own information.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be resolved there.
The investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS), which are mainly demanded by large corporations, are considered to be one of the main reasons for the large resistance in Europe against TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can fight for damages to taxpayers, leverage national laws or implement a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the Commission’s proposals as inadequate.
In particular, it was criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, German Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD) called the plans a major step forward.
The Commission takes into account key points in the reform that the German Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the ability of the economy to appeal through too many new rules.
Particularly small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the talks about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year.
This date is no longer valid.
Delicate Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a Flipchart, on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with a felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost captured by Stevens’ lecture.
He tells from various places he records on the map over and over again what his detailed and delicately arranged songs tell about.
Where they originated and what it looks like in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven himself to be a wonderful creative fool.
With the 2003 release and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear harmoniously very close to the American folk of the late 1960s, but can drive into the great opulent at any time.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" would be the first part of a moving series: each of the 50 U.S. states is supposed to be beaten in a row.
But already in 2004 and near Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations.
Reduced, Stevens will appear here.
Live is enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinois"), a groundbreaking masterpiece will appear in 2005.
Exceeding ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard charts and is lacking in no yearly list of the most influential music media.
After highly productive experiments, Stevens then uses a lot of electronic spare parts on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
Length of the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle made of neon string tapes and large fluorescent stage finishes.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring through Germany as part of a five-headed band.
More in the dark hamburger!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" that has been available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, the considerably mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folklore.
Without addressing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
You hear from the audience: the lecture is "opulent" and you can throw away the "plate basically".
Stevens is humble, plays a few older songs acoustically, and eventually bows down with applause.
Jeremy Corbyns Debuts at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's questioning hour is eagerly awaited
The new Labour chairman, Jeremy Corbyn, is set to make his debut at the Prime Minister’s questioning hour and discuss for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six predetermined questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely being examined by the media and the Labour MPs closely.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it will come after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour president’s decision to hold silent during the National Anthem’s singing on Tuesday at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he had “stayed in respectful silence” and recognized “the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England.”
But a member of Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC’s Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem “independently” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn’s top team, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences also "stack up" within Labour, according to Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation on winnings.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is proposing amendments to remove the whole idea of a restriction altogether.
Hours later, Smith, the shadow labor and retirement minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to lower the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman to face David Cameron, who has been Tory's boss, over the dispatch box in Parliament for the past decade.
The Labour president, who has promised another policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and he has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister’s questioning hour is too confrontative, and that he will stop both “striking” and fighting backwards, and has instead focused on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr. Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Minister of the Economy, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, if Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally took the floor, and that he addressed John Bercow, the spokesman of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to step away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle theatre", which is often associated with the prime minister's questioning hour, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the questioning hour with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs extensive reforms.
'Shootings in Joburg': Homeless young people trained as photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn their livelihood.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take pictures of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound increases due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound jumped sharply from data showing an increase in the UK’s wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by SABMiller’s bid target.
Between May and July, the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9% compared to the same previous year period.
This percentage was the fastest and the fastest estimates made since 2009 on the time of interest rate increases.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to <0x24>1.5505 and climbed to 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a jump of 20% after the takeover offer of rival AB InBev was received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher, according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that revenue in China – a key market for Burberry – is back in growth.
Glencore’s shares rose 5% after the mining company said it took <0x24>2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a 4.3% decline after Goldman Sachs set his rating for the company to "sell".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax earnings of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost could meet JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the Capital: On the Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lipstick 21 years young, a hamster with oversighted hair.
The guy with platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Pretty much more.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation turns around.
Like Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
However, since 7 a.m., the polyn sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin’s luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber building: Here you live an idol whose poster has been hanging in Stettin since Monday night.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs just as much a day as her mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "Actually, my Victoria would have to be in the tenth grade in high school."
"I'm fulfilling a dream for her."
A school duty?
Who's juckt's?
Not the fans.
Neither does Bieber.
He's taken care of anyway.
For the ads during the Super Bowl break, he cashed <0x24>3 million, a two-year deal with an anti-pick-up firm owed many, many dollars to the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the store table, Bieber also cashes.
When Justin Bieber drinks coffee, you stand on the windowsill.
He is said to have earned more than <0x24>100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others stress that Bieber is finally in the US and UK with his new single "What do you mean?" at number one.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is set to follow in November, is not interested in many zeros at first.
At least he does.
Pegida Poster Brings Lebanese on Potato Tones Idea
Potatoes or doughnuts?
It is both - and that is the potato toner developed by Oldenburg’s imbiss owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "potatoes instead of donuts" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a spike.
The idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of Danes", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, there has been a barbecue spice in his shop, which is packed with meat and potatoes.
"This is multicultural for the stomach," says Alhay.
The Lebanese has now registered with the Munich Patent Office.
There, according to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a pattern of use.
That’s why Alhay doesn’t want to betray how much meat and how much potatoes the spice contains.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of the people is also good for its customers.
Metcash launches soil stability campaign to combat Aldi attack
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA affiliates from an Aldi uprising in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground stability campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a <0x24>700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the brand IGA through mainstream marketing, e-marketing, and marketing through e-marketing.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice maker Simmo from Dunsborough, distributing samples in IGA stores and store owners selling affordable tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash will release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and appliances wholesaler performs its annual investor strategy day.
Much is at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the East.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorious provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the East.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after opening its first markets, Aldi will squeeze around five percent of the food market in these two states and remove all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose <0x24>360 million in revenue per year and Metcash <0x24>250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and achieve a turnover of <0x24>500 million and <0x24>600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food store and in the amounts on Metcash’s high fixed-cost basis could cost Metcash about <0x24>13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr. Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market shares in the East, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017, and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is assumed that a member of Metcash's board contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has decreased from 18 percent since 2010 to 14 percent, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, resulting in operational debt reductions at the same time as marginal pressures and turnover.
The wholesaler, however, defends itself and invests more than <0x24>150 million to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products each week and improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through fast-growing fresh food products and providing a better choice of private labels.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and store sanitation programs will be applied to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to Australian tennis federation president Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is often referred to as "Special Ks", is brought to light by Kyrgios' famous confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati shortly thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the referee twice, with Harrison shouting, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis bat after a cramp defeated a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
"One thing I'm pretty much talking about is the fact that in my opinion Thanasi was a little bit drawn into the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a bat when he lost due to a cramp in the U.S. Open, but he’s not the first player to break a bat out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little too harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he is well in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I believe he deserves his own service.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important pre-decision that starts on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term solid component."
"First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick is very quickly succeeded in the ascension to which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we try to support him for the best for trying it in his hand, and we try to keep the time in the
Europe’s refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, holds refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and set off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border, when hundreds of migrants gathered in a nobody’s country and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
The people who had fled from violence stood for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
As a police helicopter floated over them, the migrants chanted "Open the Border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian preparedness police.
Some have withdrawn food and water from protests.
Serbia’s foreign minister said it was “unacceptable” that migrants would be sent back from Hungary as more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc could not agree on a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU would take another 120,000 refugees, including some from UN.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on a soon-to-be action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis, enabling them to block roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it finished a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even inmates were employed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, Hungary has become a significant passport and a point of entry into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life, and not refugees who are entitled to protection - an opinion that strongly contradicts other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13-foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher penalties for detainees.
“Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovac told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree procedurally to the military's deployment, which is expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, the country’s security adviser for Orban, said authorities had cleared 45 people while trying to cross the border, while 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come across by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are about to repair the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a railroad train had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos encircled the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people’s data and pushed a crowd to push into it.
About 20 were able to enter, but thousands were left out.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton’s lead over Bernie Sanders cuts in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins against her on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre-election (58 percent before), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (increase by 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for president, receives 15 percent of the Democratic voters in the election.
More than five months before the start of the election, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more resilient in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some profits.
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates, but these advances have diminished.
Their support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind this.
Clinton’s advantage for democratic voters under 50 has been distracted, and she and Sanders are now on the same level.
However, Clinton still has a big lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a two-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
Approximately half of the Democratic voters in the nationwide election said they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently don’t support Clinton—only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the polls say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this over their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the view that it’s time for a woman to become president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the Job.
Clinton’s supporters also mention their connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also cited.
As the vice president throws potential for the presidential office into the balance sheet, 57 percent of the Democratic voters want to see him in the race — although a third believe he shouldn’t.
If democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s lead rises from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chances of winning the election, but this number has fallen from 78 percent in the past month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most selectable" has increased.
However, when asked what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters raise questions about eligibility.
Like last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters stands out as unacceptable.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results in some of the key features of their party’s pre-election voters.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best off the three candidates with honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don’t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t have an opinion about him.
Democratic voters of the pre-election generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all of these measures, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server continue to be asked during her tenure as foreign minister, most Democratic voters in the pre-election are satisfied with her statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced her opinions at all.
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinion of her had deteriorated further.
There are mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is seen by her party’s voters as honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for them overall among registered voters: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month, and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also see Trump as dishonest and unreliable.
However, Clinton and Trump are getting good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush cut off best in honesty.
A majority considers Sanders to be more than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the preliminary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in a nationwide poll
Ben Carson is in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now lack half of voter support in the new poll, and others are dramatically losing hold
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide, growing from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in Tuesday’s poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is well-advanced in demographic groups and Trump outperforms Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, was defeated by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who fell the lowest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The error margin for the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is 6% plus or minus and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows that Carson is growing in the polls – he lands with 19% support from Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side bumps for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign rally in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm to 29 degrees Celsius.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for swimmers to find still warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some will no longer go into the sea: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) said.
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of a Baruch college student
Almost two years after a student died during a chilling ritual of a student union in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng brutally during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he had been loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand with his eyes, and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change their clothes, google their symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
“At this point, the members started hiding utensils and put the brotherhood’s well-being above that of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be resurrected, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly injured with stupendous force to the head, thigh and thigh.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the Schikanes of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died from the Schikanes every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members need to be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County Grand Jury recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the fraternity, including Mr Meng, are also charged with schismary attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
“We want not only to hold the people involved accountable, but if there is an organization that has officially or unofficially sanctioned this, then we will also blame them,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity has revoked its membership in the local group.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates.
An increase in interest rates is coming, and the house will fall into disrepair, yields for bonds will rise, and the economy will slip into a recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy provides little guidance on how to proceed.
A recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial institutions react.
That is why representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of 'cheap money'," Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal levels, but still to low levels to lead to a seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here’s a look at how some sectors of the economy could react based on historical trends:
As the market saw last month, preventing interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency that wealth returns will be depreciated 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy,” German-Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed’s interest rate increases.
More specifically, the market has been mostly in the uptrend in the last 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate increases, rather flat in the 250 days following (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal state of 500 days, with a bar rate of 14 percent, the average rate of returns in Doene set.
The Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and returns begin to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rates increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that previously did not exist and that could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly noteworthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an interest rate increase of the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Increases in interest rates in such a fragile economic landscape could be risky and raise the question of whether it is different this time,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have decided to raise interest rates by the Fed all year round, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading indicates only a 25 percent likelihood.
“In our study, all of the increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing GDP swings and pre-recession rises very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest awaited by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic course.
For bonds, the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond earnings fell immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to yields between longer and shorter bonds shrinking closer and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although “we are still cautious to expect higher yields,” said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adjusted to Fed strategy ratings.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flat, credit spans have expanded and volatility has increased - all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
Overall, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will get worse as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts.
“The story shows that quality shares tend to respond extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate increase,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Companies with strong balance sheets have exceeded on average 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also outperform their low quality pendants by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher returns, even if experts disagree how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for its "disappearance"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they only imitated The Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms" to Classic FM, claims a leading MP and increases new pressure on the broadcaster to prove he's doing something that private broadcasters don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public-law radio station was "dimmed" and no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'dimming' - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which began in December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be just under another name.
So, if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples, in which you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public enlightenment.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commissioning new works is really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder work had to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production that stood under fire during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport Selection in order to stand up to commercial rivals.
Tory MP Damien Collins joined The Voice – the BBC’s musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly noticeable?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a special BBC way".
He added that he wants the company to "find a hit from our own stall" the next time it starts a series of entertainment.
However, he declined to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or spend money from the fee payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales.
In the last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile phones to shop
Experts believe Black Friday in November has slowed down spending
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating, after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August represented the lowest growth since the start of the records in 2000, with only 5% increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, that has always evolved over time,” Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG sales index, told The Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now that’s moving in, and we may be experiencing that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for the downward turnover.
Experts believe that buyers retain their purchases prior to this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of buyers cut five times around their computers to make their groceries, and some dealer websites collapsed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers were fighting for scams, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of <0xC2><0xA3>5 spending a little more than <0xC2><0xA3>1 was spent online.
Some products, such as TVs and washing machines, now make more than a third of purchases through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims Buried in Mecca Crane Accident - Bin Laden's Family Is Sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first cemetery in Mecca
Saudi Arabia Charges Partly With the Collapse of Saudi Bin Laden Group
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane crashed into Mecca’s Great Mosque.
The mourners, largely dressed in white, filled the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead entered their last trip to the Al-Moaisem cemetery.
The procession of mourning took place at the Holy Place, where only days earlier a building crawled through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell on the beggars.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beetles that were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, the father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hadith.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hadsh will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said the Bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crown standing if it was not used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said the company’s management of travel abroad was prohibited.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hadsh, which took place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also criticized the group for failing to comply with current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounded by Mecca’s Great Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over major construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious son who was abducted by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse of the crown came amid strong winds and rains, just days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Government officials ordered 1 million rial (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time for cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Brits are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 more Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q stores nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chef correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British put down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home.
If you can handle it with a hammer or a brush to scrape walls, you seem to be a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to perform homework jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the building chain, said a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices has now become obsolete.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen and close 60 B&Q sales points.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the employees are predominantly men.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households performing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said: “A majority of men are still working in our stores.
We need to move this further to a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the choices about buying items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK-listed leading company in the FTSE100 Index, has also reorganized her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and finance board.
Mrs Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profits and sales after the group raised the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob for disloyalty to court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-champion Aich/Dob were held responsible for disloyalty and tax evasion.
The defendants did not feel guilty.
One of them was also charged with abuse of office.
In May, he was legally freed from this charge.
The current process has been postponed.
According to prosecutor Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it was crystallized that the defendants used funds from association accounts that they were allowed to use in their functions for private purposes between 2006 and 2011.
The damage is estimated at around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000.
Sports officials are also charged with financial misconduct.
The president of the Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin, dismissed this fact.
It will be negotiated at a later date.
For the purpose of disloyalty, the defence stated that the association had not at any time experienced a shortage of wealth.
The sports officials had only paid off expense compensations and the sports club, for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, had withdrawn from the debts - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 schillings (about 44,000 euros) in 2001.
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: are we going to continue the club or are we going to lock it up?", one of the defendants, in the bread industry, told the Financial Office.
With his colleague and co-accused, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
“We have deposited money, put our life insurance as security at the bank,” he said at the agreement.
It has been agreed with the club: you can manage the money freely, you can only not make any debts.
Furthermore, in the case of financial success, the payment of the expenditure compensation was decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, a part of the expense compensation was paid only years later, namely from 2003, when there was a plus on the account.
Therefore, there were also fixed and non-detail bookings, the former Obmann explained the transactions.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
Why the payouts were not disclosed in detail to the club, the judge asked.
The association has not been interested in the details of the financial settlement, only the debt relief was important, so the answer.
When an official began investigations into abuse of office in 2011, an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>120,000 was transferred to the club’s account.
These were detainees, the defendants said.
This securities account ran in the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association.
“Why?” the judge asked.
For a long time, the respondent did not know an answer.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified.
This transfer was formulated as "compensation of damages".
Why damages?, the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then stated that he did not agree with this formulation because there was never any damage to the club.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "With that, you're all out of the cutter."
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said he never paid a cent, he only calculated mileage and diets.
On diets, he charged the club <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 per month, but the actual expenditure was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide accurate documents for the early years.
These were no longer retained after an operational inspection, in which everything was judged to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant also had mileage.
All the repairs were done in cash, he had to drive from his place of residence Volkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he said in his statement.
The main trial will continue on September 23 with the interview of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard to Release 30,000 Jobs
In addition to the decommissioning of personnel that has been going on for three years, the computer giant will decommission further jobs in the company’s division.
The job openings at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) have no end.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. technology group plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This will save <0x24>2.7 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 billion) in costs, the company said on Tuesday.
The move will lead to a special burden of around <0x24>2.7 billion, which will strike from the fourth quarter.
The decommissioning of 55,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed.
HP employed around 302,000 people at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
The Hewlett-Packard stock was 2.3 percent.
The group, which grew up with printers in Palo Alto, California, is currently splitting up: This is how the computer and printer business is to be merged into a new society – separate from the more forward-looking areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A further disappointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services added the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer, after Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, PC and printer sales decreased by 11.5 percent.
Revenue fell 8% to almost <0x24>25.4 billion.
Thus, revenues returned in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a break-up and massive job creations to the changes in the industry.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has only reacted lately to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and running more and more stores online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans predict the total decommissioning of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority Supports Anti-IS Training Mission
The direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq, however, would largely result in rejection: 54 per cent voted against it, and 35 per cent voted in favour.
The fact that other states are flying airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24 percent are against interfering in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syrian power-holder Bashar al-Assad is rejected by 51 percent of respondents, 20 percent would be in favour.
Twenty-nine percent were unable to decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The focus of the trade fair is on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until September 27.
After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility Connects" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the Auto-Verband VDA expect about 900,000 visitors, as it did two years ago.
Röszke: Violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
Hungarian police have deployed hundreds of refugees at the Serbian border near Röszke Tearnegas and water launchers.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
Behind them was a police line formed, and behind the police was a water slider.
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials initially used uninterrupted pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees are now waiting for a little bit of a retreat.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
The children who had inhaled the tear gas were crying.
Other refugees plunged into each other and suffered from breathlessness.
The Serbian police press spokespersons also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. Notenbank
The world is watching when the U.S. Notenbank meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates will be raised for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half of those who thought last week that the Fed would do so now think the Fed will hold up a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed set interest rates to NULL.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero-range and start a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior associate at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good performance level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate a slight inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less reddish outlook on global conditions.
She warned the markets to set up for an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. on Thursday
Shooter at Delta State University left an apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – and before he shot and killed his colleagues later in the day – Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that it was "leid tut" at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it unheard of."
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency department staff that the police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will bother," but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to be able to reverse it.
I loved Amy, and she’s the only woman who ever loved me.”
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who stated that they were married for about seven years, as a "good man".
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Stone said he and Prentiss had a daughter, 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground."
He said Prentiss was her daughter's "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had been meeting Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, ran on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral degree from Delta State University in spring 2015, as his life expectancy is stated on the University’s website.
Stars who have lost their luck
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor is also alleged to have struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of possession of drugs.
All of this certainly demands his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa to Rebuild Group
Lufthansa plans to build a large group.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization.
150 of the world’s around 1000 executives will cost the workplace to build a group number.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is reshaping its corporate structure and evaluating the low-cost subsidiary of Eurowings.
The goal of the reorientation is to contribute approximately EUR 500 million annually from cost and revenue synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the board of directors of Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the redesign, Spohr underscores the importance of Eurowings, with which the group wants to face Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines signed under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of the annual turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the Cockpit Pilots Association (VC), negotiations are to be resumed after the judicially suspended strike on Thursday.
This was reported by the union.
The theme of the talks should be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants "in a year with a predicted record result" to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible.
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the savings concept is "Wings".
In the fight against competitors, Lufthansa is expected to outsource routes to the Eurowings Group’s new airline.

Manchester United’s Luke Shaw can’t play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left outside defender to tears and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the playground for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be relocated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
"It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, it's very hard and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
In the dressing room he wore an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I’m not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it will take six months, and he won’t play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped from a red card and the imposing of an elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself if I say an eleventh and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Manchester United suffers loss of Luke Shaw in PSV defeat
The England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very serious injury."
When a player with this type of injury leaves the place, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaal’s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's getting very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then if you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in another direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel really bad about it, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul by Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It’s one thing all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won’t take long for you to know it almost exhaustively.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children’s book, the Prime Minister of The Lorax decided to issue Dr. Seuss’s 1971 environmental label.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company’s website SuperCamps, and continues: “Clean, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it’s a book that I like to read to my children because it always seems to have a picture or a message that we’ve missed before.”
Everything is beautiful and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the book's action, instead reproduces a content of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"But in the midst of the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling his desire to see a real tree. laitte lamelle, the seostar, and one's interest in reading Theo.
As if that weren't suspicious enough: the text submitted by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins as follows: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial, the Hermund to the Hermund, and even the air after the Hermund is a tee, a ware.
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book. Here an unnamed boy hears spears, like the local environment by the money-loving, falling trees, thneed knitting once-learning, in spite of the protests of the broom.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to an assistant who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron’s constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but did not provide any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
To hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the frame England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test Series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn’t rule out an outside victory.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting performance, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars from 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali evolves as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth breaks out of the England Test and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to exclude Adam Lyth, of course, is difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because – and I’ve said this before – players are their own best voters.
A long time ago, Lyth had been prolonged, but he had control of his own fate.
Hopefully if he kicks out more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he didn’t deliver such good performances, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test striker gets to put his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances – like Sam Robson before him – while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton was given the chance to play at home and abroad.
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first employed Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean – as Lyth was in the highest form – but this lost chance lies in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hit man I highly appreciate.
He’s an X-factor cricketer that we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which hit us very hard.
He must have at least the same chances as those before him, but of course this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beat alongside Cook, which would bring an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, came up, and I don’t mind.
I don’t see why a striker can’t hit there, and this left hand has already shown that he’s a devilish skull of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before performing as an opener in 2001.
He scored three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the frame as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he impressed me very much as a young man.
People might look at his stats – on average 31 with the batter and 35 with the ball – and think it’s a point, but there’s not a large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have chosen for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan Batsman, as an advisor for the test games could be a championship coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game that will bring a lot of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment to the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with the above.
Colly’s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used for the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team publishers do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made with a light heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit <0x3D> UK exit from the EU) could gain entry if the economy falls into a flurry by 2017
David Cameron’s unsuccessful renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper and deeper with each day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is leaving for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now and not always out of their own guilt, the UK’s own agenda with split concessions and disturbing treaty changes that they most often do not want to be sated.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like them either when they jeopardize social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK looking to the outside within the EU-Zel – “Don’t let us alone with France,” says Berlin – and lets see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where we don’t care whether they’re going or not.
Germany’s cautiously special Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it happened with the overly long-lasting ones such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s François Hollande is looking at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain may have a left.
It’s hard to imagine that they’ll be kicking out a leg to help the selfie Britain, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, during the UK’s 2017 referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a pleite" and "The United Kingdom has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how robbing Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were not during the 1975 Tony Benn-inspired referendum that supported our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
They can be weakly reminded of Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro opportunist, who made a name for himself as a "EU-specific banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo non-Indians who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but found that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distract him rather than be at his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he objected to Cameron’s referendum because Blair had put the principle of the EU’s non-adopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a backdoor.
The press has never forgiven him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly kick on my back in Westminster on Monday – I told him he didn’t need any more time to waste for me – seems at risk to repeat Neil Kinnock’s boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and today.
It can take a while, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I am kindly expressing it - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Now, most people outside of Ukip’s traditional blue dye tendency and the wild fields of Tory’s small-Englishism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week, when the pathfinder was struggling in him, not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as a shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old father on television tried to be unloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary’s struggle was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow contenders and MPs after all the reports at her bailout session on Monday night.
Whatever the turbulent bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important around the clock in the era of TV and, above all, in the skull of social media, a birthplace of vernoia and paranoia.
It is right that Cameron does not give a free card for Europe that allows him to hold Labour’s support in the referendum campaign for self-evidence, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which the basic narcissism of the small zensity is a difference.
As with his ambiguity about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense in everything for their executives at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital – they also have suspicious voters – to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction in the cost of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded at the start on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts Criticize Public Health England Report on E-Cigarettes
State-funded claims that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “basic report” last month and describes it as a “exhaustive review of the evidence.”
However, some researchers have questioned the burdenability of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A leading article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy foundation" on which PHE grounded his most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the allegations are "built on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said the public expects PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were summoned to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in order to develop their opinions on the effects of the various nicotine products.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was previously said to have received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said they were receiving funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was reported to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for selecting the members of the board are not provided, but this includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The tobacco management of PHE also participated in the meeting.
The group's research "significantly agrees" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers."
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s claims had already been responded to.
He said, “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two smokers dies from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to this, but that we still have to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative hazards compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness, and smoking costs the National Health System <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By providing clear evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC Should Give Up EastEnders, Ex-Chef of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in harshly disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had been trying to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
“I have problems with the idea that the BBC is commissioning or sending programs that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals,” Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the radio fee, which I don’t think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least have its production on programs that others don’t do or order.
They send The Voice in a top-notch time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s of course nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t see why a regressive tax program can be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see what this public-law television is like.
I don’t think that would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of hunting for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people working there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts reflect what former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said the rather public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they can fulfill their tasks, and they can argue if they've seen on their seemingly sacred missions to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion."
They put her in a time window where no one ever wanted to see her.
Speaking on the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of who can get the best value from it.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value here for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year, but for people who for <0xC2><0xA3>150 is a lot of money, ask me if that’s true because they don’t consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also said before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, form and entertain".
He said little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education — he said there was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio — and she should take an example of changing this to “inform, educate, and entertain” public-law television broadcasters in Australia and Canada.
Asked about the partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the proms, of which he said only a handful will be shown on TV, and enter alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' Can Control Brain Cells Through Sound Waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard.
The pulses work by switching on Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Researchers Reading and Writing Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart, and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that electrical impulses into people’s brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplifie the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report by Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the altered motor neurons.
The process has some similarities to optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with light pulses.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic wave tissue can pass unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
“We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments,” said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right at your door!
The ads embarrass the UK's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International Anti-Weapon Fair video.
Terrible killer drones!
Foot joint crushing leg cuffs!
Stream bomb!
And electric shock rods that cause painful pain, but leave no trace!
The joyful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this announcement for the world’s largest arms fair is a combat parody produced by Amnesty International to bring to light the willingness of the British government to bring weapons to repressive regimes at the London Centre through the International Jamboree Security Team.
Related: DSEI Weapons Fair: Authoritarian regimes flow to London
But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Are you driving the DLR from September 15th to 18th?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the London Underground fonts and the DLR line trademarks that turn into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will drive with the DLR ... Customers will be asked to help stop the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a <0xC2><0xA3>6 pack of inbound keys, which claim that "access to about a third of the bus stop advertising spaces on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists engage with activists within protest movements and notice that they need to go outside into the real world in order for their art to have an influence on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade plaques greets the pedestrians in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the arms fair – through an empty space on the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the invention of a more realistic dubious corporate advertising, but "through bright colors and animation, it remains more sticky."
“They’ve done a fantastic job by helping us sharpen awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” said Amnesty’s Tom Davies.
What we need now is an intervention of the British government and a guarantee that torture devices will not be illegally traded at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors craft fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army over "the AT4CS RS shot from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped combat head that delivers outstanding after-effect effects within the goal."
Whatever it does, it will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Housing
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a student residence, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those I have angered – and the numerous, long-lasting complaints about others.
Most of what I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student residences ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely frightening.
It’s tempting to sweep: tell people where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you “honestly don’t love or hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract HAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others do the same – ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find out the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and these fire extinguishers were.
Let people go.
People’s rooms often turn into drink receptions, movie night venues, and communal meeting points, but they’re also the places people dress up and dress up for their underwear.
Referring to: Don’t Remember to Start a Relationship at University
Introverts receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a space-to-space bummel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave so that I can get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to sense when a ton of friendliness is exhausted – and send him an SMS instead of ringing.
By the way, tap: Do it.
A guy in my student residences had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw a few things.
Close friendship by baking.
As you start college at the height of back-mania, knocking at people's doors to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the 1950s greeting "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked you something." So, and now please smile when I ask you a question
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friendships.
Your peers feel committed to having a conversation and may eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, clapping chickens is a robbery, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
The odds are good that they say they serve themselves, even when they are cooking inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
They should not make noise that keeps people from sleeping or from work.
It’s not just about being a decent person, it’s about being one of the people in the glasshouse in the truest sense.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if it mattered to them to put Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three o’clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before she let her own music splatter, closed her door, and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally entered the same student residence?
Conversely, wouldn’t it be deeply embarrassing if you hold a cohabitant for your future spouse, crawl at her, divorce her, and then have to see her every day, and maybe co-exist, as she moves all her common friends to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot cohabitant is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to make a little sense to your lower abdomen.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unclosed room, the boundary between a ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good shot is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes the bumerang.
Give a valuable and fun lesson on safety by hiding - but never waste anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not stack their possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Residents for refugees, single-parents, low earners
Real estate contractor Markus Gildner is building row houses for people who don’t have a lot of money in the middle of the Frankish Corner Valley.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single-educating mother and the low-income earner."
"I show you how to build still cheaply and well today," the 44-year-old said in the interview.
Thousands of refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheap living space can be created: he builds row houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be pushing the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Massive accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people are staying for a large part here.
Given the flow of refugees, we will also need enough housing for the next few decades.
A very banal, three-storey row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when people are housed in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for each four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it’s peace again, I’m going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
That's understandable.
The construction took six months to complete.
That's appropriate.
Did the construction regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: In terms of construction, I carried out my project correctly.
It always makes the threatening Damokless value of special construction and the parking regulations particularly complicated.
Awful.
It is still assumed that those who create three apartments in a row house need at least three parking spaces.
There is no room for that in the cities.
Refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents react to their row house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you intensify the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: The truth is, we had a building boom in Germany for the last five years, but luxury apartments were built that can barely afford one more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only the refugees, but also the single-parent mother or the low earner.
I will show you how to build still cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem engineering in Regensburg and initially engaged in environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple updates are released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, taping "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after installing because they receive an error message that tells them that the "Software Update" has failed.
To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait until the storm returns or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by slimming up the update. Similarly, it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool, delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue as the phone may turn off halfway and this could result in the update being discontinued.

You should also make sure that you have reviewed our checklist of all things before you download to prevent things from going wrong and to protect yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, re-opening the system, as well as changing the layouts.
Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the Formula 1 World Championship against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The second World Cup highlighted before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing more to lose".
53 points separate the deputy world champion from title defender and double-champion Hamilton on Sunday before the night of the race in Singapore.
The British have already won seven of the twelve races of the season so far and is also taking the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an impact on Singapore’s Great Price is unclear.
For days, a dark bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Friends of Chess Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has stayed in Bad Kissingen for the cure more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is a member of the first-class Bundesverdienstkreuz and an honorary citizen of the towns of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has been supported by Gauselmann with a donation received by President Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to accept chess players who are unable to make the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-White" will be seen as an expression of his connection with the Kurstadt.
Quartiersbüro is looking for direct contact
Salutis and the old centre Antonistift have joined together under the umbrella of the Social Foundation and opened a new point of contact at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The Social Foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More specifically, at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office has recently been opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, we will immediately receive seniors and counselling information on issues such as health insurance or health and nursing services.
For years, we have been finding out with our outpatient care service that caregivers are often left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Also, it is not rare that many services of the cash registers are used because the complexity of the insurances is hardly understood," explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who as head of the Altenhilfe business division is also responsible for the Antonist and the civil hospital as well as for the ambulance service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
To this end, the salutes were taken on board.
Therefore, additional offers such as drop prevention, memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers of the Senior Centre and the Salutis complement each other in an ideal way.
Salutis stands for Prevention, Prevention and Reha.
"The Seniors Center for Care and Care," described Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Salutis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is seen by both managers especially in demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the inauguration ceremonies, the Quarter Office also dedicates itself to the gathering in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
In doing so, the Social Foundation made a great contribution that seniors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as possible.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9am to 2pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 4pm to 6pm and Saturday from 10am to 12pm.
Eintracht Bamberg vs Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it’s official: Because of renovation work at the fox park stadium, the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third league Würzburger Kickers has not yet been set, the date has now been set for October 6.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the 8th final of the Bavarian Football Topokal against the third-league FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalised.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6th, at 7 p.m. at the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
“We are glad that we know now when the game is going over the stage, now we have planning certainty,” said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hämmer, who also points out the ticket pre-sale that has now started.
It’s something special for our team to play against a third-party league.
We therefore hope for many spectators, and not without reason, because flood light games have a special enthusiasm.
In the final round of 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg won in 2010 at the 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Association Cup 2016/2017.
Title Defender is third-party SpVgg Unterhacking.
Vienna architect Karl Mang dies at age 92
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna’s architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, the Artist's House said on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna bei Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and head of institutes.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treasury Chamber in the Hofburg of Vienna and the conversion of the Lobkowitz Palace to the Austrian Theatermuseum.
Punishment: Tim Wiese accuses policeman of money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese was noted in Bremen.
Soccer player was once, now Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, wrestler.
He wants to add 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the last two years, according to his own statement.
Intellectually, he did not say that.
Wiese got his hair cut in downtown Bremen just when he saw a parking space keeper displaying a penalty card for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the store, insulted the official and threw the due fine at her feet, according to the "Picture" newspaper.
The allegations are confirmed by the city of Bremen, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still being examined," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether or not to display the meadow.

For three days, the Panamanian authorities have been tearing out the 4,500 plants and burning them.

Police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday night, around 23.45, three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called on them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft gas station.
There were also three people on the site of the gas station.
One of the men shouted at the young man and hit him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a fracture of the nose and bleeded heavily from the nose.
When his two friends hurried and hurriedly sneered at the batterer, he first let go of his victim.
From his friends, the injured young man was now taken home.
The perpetrator chased the group with a car to their apartment and walked there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the striker and another male person.
With the help of a punch, they rubbed on the victim’s face and thighs.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only one vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second batter is said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was worn with jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and notifiers to call on the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen and invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>310.000
Silvia Müller-Gogoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Heinfried Kabbert, mayor of Asendorf, are also pleased.
In many places in the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is fortunate: on October 1, Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retired, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be next to his successor in the next few months with a half seat.
After a renovation phase, Müller reopens the practice on October 12th, until then he invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>310,000 in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gogoll years ago, who is currently completing her medical training at the Verdener Hospital and wants to get into practice next year as well.
“We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice,” says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was so far, I just called her."
The couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
“The closeness and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us,” says Müller, 39.
"We want to meet and accompany families over the years".
He also sees the advantage of being his own boss soon.
And so it was agreed that the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
Frank Müller grew up there and attended medical studies in Hannover in several medical clinics, as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
Currently working as a surgeon in Sulingen, he was appointed as the leading notary doctor in the district of Diepholz in 2009 and volunteered in the DRK-Bereitschaft Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen worked as a house physician, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialised in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both interns, want to settle as a family doctor.
"The endoscopy is therefore coming out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and load ECGs and need a speech room more.
In addition, the EDV will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50000 as part of a funding programme from the county (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25000) as well as from the municipality of Samt (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," said Mayor of Samtgemeinde Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients are admitted to the practice in Felstehausen every quarter, and in the German average practice there are about 500.
There is another practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the acquisition by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felstehausen.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone too.
By the way, those who visit Müller’s talk hour continue to look especially at familiar faces: they take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
With their farewell an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen smudgingly.
You feel a little bit of courage after a long time.
“But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients more often,” she says.
Her husband adds laughingly: "We have a 6,000 square meter plot."
"Until now, I've always pushed for gardening, now it could be different."
The couple also has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees pass through"
"Now border controls will also be lifted on our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also make it "obviously".
The safety and security of people is at the forefront.
But it is also clear that “it needs clear signals,” the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
There is a need for a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "Corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously notified that Slovenia also wanted to allow the arrival of refugees to travel to Austria and Germany, and that it could also build corridors for the refugees.
However, interior minister Vesna Györkös Znidar did not see this in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will instead intensify border surveillance - especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to block its borders for refugees.
“Every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work,” said Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already attempted to cross the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in eastern Croatia in the early hours of Tuesday night to avoid registration.
Croatian police were able to arrest her in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, in Croatian Tovarnik, police vehicles are constantly encountering new refugees.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in use.
In the coming days, his country expects about 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Also, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade argues that it is to instruct people to take certain routes: “We can’t, nor do we want to do this,” he said.
According to media reports, at least in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, more buses would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The settlers had been travelling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometers away.
"We have heard that Hungary has joined, so the police told us to drive here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
As a result, the already predicted shift of the Balkan-route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary could in fact become a somewhat further western route.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia’s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible emergencies in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "extensive possibilities for border control."
Strict checks are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, and the EU partners have always given the country a good testimony in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, around 300 refugees remain trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrader media reports, they had spent the night at the crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to continue to travel to the Croatian border is unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down at a local demonstration in Horgos on Wednesday: he said it was too early to discuss alternative routes for refugees after the Hungarian border was closed.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers Advise Migrants - Dangerous - Alternative Routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already started distributing maps to refugees, on which alternative routes are registered through Croatia.
However, the crossing of the border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area, there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian War, still unspaced minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners had been sent to the border region.
Stock exchange hackers: Ukrainians pay <0x24>30 million
Supranonok is said to have been part of a ring of cybercriminals accused of providing insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
With the information used, insider transactions are expected to be made in the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, a total of over <0x24>100 million was earned.
“Today’s comparison shows that even those outside our country’s borders will eventually be captured,” the SEC statement said.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospital Assistance Mannheim has been around for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a regency of operation.
People perform their concerns, partly quick steps, partly cozyly buzzing.
You control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon at the parade square.
City trams stop.
Pulsating, beautiful life with beautiful autumn sunshine and four large signs in the middle of each with the headline "Before I die I want to die"...
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospital Assistance drew attention to its 20-year existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The Head of the Ecumenical Hospital Assistance is available to the Passenger for questions and conversations as well as the volunteers.
While some people spontaneously tap into the creed and say phrases like “getting my life,” “reading,” “driving with the camper through the United States,” “stop the war,” or “don’t suffer for a long time,” others stay short, read, say sentences like “so far I’m not yet” and then go on.
Again and again small discussions are evolving on the edge about the action itself, about life, dealing with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on the spot.
“It is only when I realize that the end of this world will come for me at some point that I can live responsibly,” says the director of the Mannheim Diaconical Works, which is jointly with the Caritas Association of the Ecumenical Hospital Assistance.
That is why this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone on the boards wants to communicate publicly, however, it is understandable, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death is still taboo, according to Josefine Lammer’s experience, although the hospice movement has helped a lot in recent years to open up people.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the topic by personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance Committee called on volunteers, she immediately reported and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Sankt Vincent Hospice.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task well and the experiences and experiences made there.
“I see life from another waiting, consider it precious and appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the ambulant ecumenical hospital is free of charge and independent of religion.
The financial support of the sick funds and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as training and supervision of the deceased and mourners.
Training is offered every two years for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now displayed in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal requests can also be recorded on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial outlook for 2016 decreased
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced its profit outlook to a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to make a profit between <0x24>10.40 and <0x24>10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected <0x24>10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which are on average 4.9 per cent and will be effective on January 4, and despite higher charges for land transport of heavy and large parcels, which will be picked up from November.
The company said it still expects the result to increase compared to the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company “produces solid revenues when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
The holiday employment plans were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned <0x24>692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
The result per share was <0x24>2.42 per share, just behind the <0x24>2.44 per share predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased by 5 percent to <0x24>12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks’ surveyed analysts expected <0x24>12.23 billion.
FedEx has experienced a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has stagnated sales in its Express Shipping Unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales for ground transportation increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by <0x24>3.85, or 2.5 percent, to <0x24>150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent losses for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting this year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagon table to decide whether it’s time to raise the tax for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening over them at the end of the decorated, two-story meeting room, there is a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are set to put the nation’s economic interests ahead of everything else.
The Central Bank has a two-fold mandate from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to launch, from which unprecedented incentive to be detached by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economy’s data shows that it is growing solid, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare already cautious Fed representatives to increase this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds – and that’s only a quarter percent.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they watch,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to keep waiting,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed is going to do, which itself insecures the financial market.
About half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently predicted a rate increase this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless the strategists ease the blow by promising that another rise is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy would keep the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raises rates at this point,” he said.
If she does, “she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that an interest rate increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will trade.
Even a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on the right track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expected an increase in the rate this year despite complaints by liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level that the Fed considers full-time employment.
Salary increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tensions in the labour market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world collapsed at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would undermine global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, with the dow now below the May high by almost 10%.
For Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates.
“If the events in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have drawn the strain at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. employee.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get the effects better handled.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically included in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the currency authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “enforce” its monetary expansion sparked confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc’s global asset management strategy.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are not apparently linked to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who advocates an interest rate increase, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia prompted the Fed to lower its lead interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings “despite its limited recognizable impact on U.S. growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's Interest Fixing Committee.
The recent turbulence does not come close to this level, he said.
"She certainly doesn't want to get into the situation where she's afraid of an interest rate rise because the markets are excited," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don’t think it should predict the time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/storage was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, he is in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/lager is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shopping makes you hungry, there is a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this store is located near the boxes and has various take-away options.
What's there: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably did.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat tray is extensive, as well as the fish tray - the staff behind the table will clean and filet the fish and even roast on request for you.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and gallant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and gall, pork intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the box.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Todayerswerda: Small Life Aid for Refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give them a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunteers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support unhelpful asylum seekers in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a body and soul teacher.
Even with her 74 lenses she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum-seeker’s home on Dillinger Street.
There, she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, the lesson is completely different than at a proper school.
Brazil’s pediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS tries to educate women in a shocking way about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding. It does this by presenting pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results suggest that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernried Sporthalle
The municipal council of Bernried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof can be flatter for solar system.
Plans for the long-awaited gym construction at the Bernried Sportplatzen are moving forward step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the drafted construction proposal was unanimously blessed without major discussions.
Previously, the Board had decided, among other things, to apply for an "exempt" or "exempt" of the current construction plan.
The "exception" was the permission for a special form with regard to the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "satellite roof with non-centered first and surplus roof" will be built.
The plan is based on the planned use of the roof area for solar plants: "This will bring together a wonderfully large southern roof," Mayor Josef Steigenberger said at the meeting.
The "liberation" was, in turn, about the roof tilt, which, for energetic reasons - unlike those prescribed in the construction plan - should be below ten degrees.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "release" was therefore necessary because the construction plan does not allow "exceptions" with regard to the roof tilt - the Bernried municipal council is usually more restrictive on requests for exemption.
However, the construction of the gym is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The gym building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Approximately 2.3 million euros are included in the cost.
Grants are expected from the school and sports promotion.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36-metre hall will now be submitted to the Land council for examination.
Peißenberg Clinic moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of the staff move from Piessenberg to Schongau.
This is the surprising plans of the county’s Hospital GmbH, which Landrätin Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, the Supervisory Board will take a decision on this, and it will be held on Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Peißenberg.
The overwhelming majority is expected to move to Schongau with Fischer and the still existing inner station.
The rooms are there.
Employees who cannot travel to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Weiß.
Employees are informed about the plans.
Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been the medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year, is now switching to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When asked who should take over the succession, according to Jochner-White, the name "Fischer" came into the game, who declared himself willing to take over the leadership from 1 October and change with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgrade" and a spread of the offer in the area of "Internal Medicine", according to Jochner-White.
Fischer is a specialist in cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the inner station.
Transitionally for the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agree, will run both houses until next year the former hospital of the Knappheit, which still has 35 beds, will be permanently closed in Peissenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018, when the current renovation at Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Councillor Jochner-White, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, met with rumors that the house, which is owned by the federal shortage, is expected to be used in the future as accommodation for asylum seekers.
As with the property, Jochner-White could not say that there were several considerations.
Currently, there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatry.
"What was better could not have happened to us, such an opportunity does not come back," Fischer said of the quasi-transition to the lake, which had been "positive and very understandable" by the employees.
There is no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to assume the post of Medical Director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (one hundred beds) has been repeatedly threatened with closure over the past decades, and departments have been closed, such as surgery and childbirth.
The handballers of the Rhine-Neckar-Löwen are requested this evening (20.15) at the Bergischen HC.
Although the leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, there is no reason for overwhelmingness.
Last season, the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and had a good time there.
Hunting accident with two injured in Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by fire.
During the opening of a cornfield near Pratau (Wittenberg County), several hunters were in use, according to police.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old man and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident could have happened was unclear at first.
The criminal police are investigating.
16-Year-Old Missing Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violence
A suspect has led police to the body of the 16-year-old missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the hearing, the 20-year-old confessed to killing the young men and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old who has been missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate has been the victim of a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday night in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, the prosecutor's office and police said on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old also detained on Tuesday night is considered a suspect, who confessed to the incident and led the investigators to the site of the body.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not returned home as agreed after visiting an autumn party in Rockenhausen.
When searching for the young woman, the investigators first found personal belongings of the victim.
In interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing, there was finally a suspected act against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The detainee admitted to the police hearing that he killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be brought to the court on Wednesday, with the investigators impeaching him.
The further investigations are intended to provide information on the circumstances of the incident.
Refugees need housing: study warns of housing gaps
The situation in the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for affordable accommodation.
Pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is faced with a challenge.
The distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would need to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study on behalf of the Alliance "Social Housing".
For comparison: 260,000 units will be manufactured in Germany this year.
There are 140,000 apartments missing.
Refugees are no longer obliged after the first three months of their stay to live in a first-time asylum seeker.
Many then hit the housing market and get into the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not just about the increasing number of refugees.
The study also marks significant shortcomings in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit that is growing year after year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units were missing in the Ballung areas, complained Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Therefore, many professionals lived in large cities listed in WG rooms.
Young adults were involuntarily staying at the "Hotel Mama" because of the flute on the housing market.
In major cities, the number of square meters per capita has declined for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a new start.
New incentives are to re-encourage social housing construction.
In this way, the land tax could be waived and the land tax for subsidized housing would be suspended for a period of time.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The funding programme for refugee accommodations of the State Bank KfW is already good for cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million available had already been recovered on Monday night with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be expanded.
Refugees are free: Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
After Hungary, there is virtually no more passage, as more and more refugees are choosing the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow the crossing of Slovenia to the north without barriers.
The route is dangerous, though.
Croatia wants to negotiate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the shooting down of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there.
500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports Croatian television broadcaster RTL.
The day before, Hungary had closed its border for refugees.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make regular asylum procedures in Hungary practically redundant.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: “You can travel, and we are preparing for this opportunity.”
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
Croatian police arrested the first refugees at the Serbian border with the EU's neighbouring Croatia this morning.
Most of the media reports came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately upon their arrival, they had tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not encounter border fences.
The border strip poses other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mining spaces are now to quickly create a safe passageway.
However, after the closure of the border, there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary.
On Tuesday, police arrested 366 people.
Shortly before closing on Monday, there were still 9,380.
The new Hungarian laws put the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings have been initiated in the southern border town of Szeged.
The convicts are facing prison sentences of up to five years and the expulsion from the country.
According to the Immigration Authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition to Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 more refugees were detained there.
However, practically no one has the prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary anymore.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
Refused asylum seekers will be dispatched there.
Just a few hundred more refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers began to clean it up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the streetside in recent weeks.
Barriers were demolished and one of the warehouses in the border resort was rebuilt.
No one wanted to express themselves for the purpose of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees reach Austria.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to the government.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on instructions from the German authorities.
In liberation, smaller groups of refugees regularly entered on foot.
Mayor drives "beautiful" across the border
“We were busy cleaning up after the bridge party on Sunday, when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent with travel victims,” said Wernstein Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had stopped rail traffic with Austria surprisingly on Sunday, it was in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the beaches along with two other helpers and their cars to the near Passau.
Previously, we had the unexpected guests once refreshed, with jazz and drinks.
We just said we'd take her to Passau by car.
“That was obvious to us,” Stadler said in the O<0xC3><0x96>N conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man did not allow himself to pass a generous donation - <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 for the firefighter.
“We were very happy,” Stadler said.
On Sunday night in Wels, the beached train passengers had shifted from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that train traffic to Germany had been stopped.
However, the regional train was stopped in front of the border at Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival is associated with the Bavarian neighbours socially on Sunday, days before a two-bridge race athletic - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends thousands of more slogans to us is a logical result of a seemingly holy policy:
Instead of immediately helping to build structures that ensure humanity in the Röszke camp, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly pushed the Hungarian government’s position into the dark circle of National Socialism.
It is not only those Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas that are suffering from this policy.
Refugees will also have to realize that the "Goddess Land" which they have invited and welcomed is nothing more than another refugee camp.
Given the ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter, it will be a great challenge to create humane conditions for asylum seekers.
And there will be an even bigger one – maintaining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad is looking for 35,000 winter-resistant quarters
Konrad has all hands to do with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up neighborhoods for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in Traiskirchen’s first recording centre has already taken over Konrad.
"We don't have homeless people in Traiskirchen anymore," he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday was also carried out without a big whirlwind, Konrad said, praising the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, another 35,000 housing needs to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 will be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without ground," Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the Heads of State.
They had promised him to create even for the upcoming refugee quarters.
"In Upper Austria it's going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former vice-president supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help.
The Asylum Coordinator also puts great expectations in the ORF action "Help Like Us".
On the platform, individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
There are also hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of need, it may not be necessary for quarters to comply with a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the top lights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" would have to apply.
The fact that, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, he was more successful in accommodation, Konrad justifies with his experience.
I am an older man who cannot be told the truth without further ado.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not charge the Republic, as they themselves declared.
They want to increase the number of employees to three to four.
Our own neighborhood search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are apparently problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better breakdown
For the first time, the city of Linz is not planning to open city sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the persons concerned could be accommodated without these measures at the moment, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In case of an emergency, however, other sites should be checked for their suitability.
The mayor is criticizing the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Frontiers are not cut off"
In a prolonged telephone conversation with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), President Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday agreed on further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be closed.
The return of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany at first.
However, the asylum seekers would be brought to Germany on regular trains.
Pyhringer once again called for increased solidarity on the issue of refugees from the other EU member states.
The fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" for Pyhringer of the Germans' actions.
The next runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linzer industrial area is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the stock exchange-listed IT group S&T, the rest (2,700 square meters) is to be leased to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
“In IT, smart minds are our raw material – and we have to try to make them work for us,” says Hannes Niederhauser, S&T’s chief executive.
He can imagine investing in start-up companies of the new yard and later acquiring them.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises something: "The next runtastic is just a matter of time".
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 million was invested by S&T in the site, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.3 million from the Techcenter, each belonging to a third of the city of Linz, the Land of Upper Austria and the Federation (FFG).
The building has been owned by Linz AG for 60 years by S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the remaining 2700 square meters in the building are already rented, for an additional 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opens second store in the arcade
Furla handbags are at the center of the new shop.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to marry a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project briefly in the pigeon market arcade: she has finally grown in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla store opposite the store, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes from various manufacturers, now all about women's handbags of the brand Furla, wallets are to have from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
It was rebuilt several weeks ago.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about opening another store," says Breit.
The key to the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also made by the idea of their own location where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand,” says the mother of two daughters, who even has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has got Breit put in the cradle from her mother.
I get the most pain when something is evolving and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why do so many women look at a beautiful handbag in decoration, even the expert woman can’t answer with the last certainty.
Maybe it’s because a nice bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmaker from Kallstadt
The False Ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place called the Inhabitants.
This characteristic is also associated with the billionaire who wants to become President of the United States.
Donald Trump, 69, is always good for exciters.
Whether he expresses himself hostile to foreigners, talks about journalists loudly, or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy – the candidate for the US presidential office is turning up the campaign vigorously.
And cut it off well.
This is also registered in the Pfalz city of Kallstadt, where the real estate billionaire’s grandparents originated.
The New Yorker with hairdryer is a term for many in the winery village on the wine road.
Some in the 1200-resident place is more than twenty corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Cold City in the Falklands: Donald Trump, here in election campaign mode.
Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think of his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
“I think they find this somewhat exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their cold city style,” says Simone Wendel.
The born Kallstadter has made a fun documentary about the place and its famous slogans, including the Heinz Ketchup family alongside Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
To the King of Hearts he did not bring it there.
While there is respect for the family’s performance, it also tends to think that Trump is “a little bit of a big mule,” Wendel says.
Accidentally, the nickname, the cold city in the vicinity has, "Die Brulljesmacher" - in High German: the indicators, she says.
Trump comes from the village of the plaintiffs.
Trump’s success story began in 1885, when his later grandfather emigrated to the United States and opened a place for gold mines.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first real estate purchases in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents were not tragic: their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian state to which the Falks belonged at the time.
He did not receive Trump because he had once been dismissed without permission, the director of the Institute of False History and Folklore, Roland Paul, said.
Trump is the grandson of an “illegal immigrant.”
This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the offspring.
He had repeatedly reluctantly spoken about Mexican immigrants to the U.S. and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“The way he’s complaining, that’s not so sympathetic,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump (“Grandma was a born Trump, Grandpa was born Heinz”).
The retired winemaker sees the Americans more distanced, “he’s always so upsetting.”
Do you think Trump will come?
“I can’t imagine that,” says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt".
Pensionist Veronika Schramm mentions, like some call townspeople, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which came generally well.
“I can’t imagine that from Donald,” says the 68-year-old.
It would be better if he didn’t give up the election, because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who had the saying at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winemaker daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
“My president is not,” she says.
And: "The grapes will ripen even without President Trump".
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 moviegoers, including in the United States, arousing interest.
The Oberbayern municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
By the hand of the Vice-President of the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-resident village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountain villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates ratings despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hurried to Canberra to report the loss of Liberal leadership, but it did not make any major shifts in today's ratings.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull created the fall of Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a one-week series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise reached an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today’s 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
Today reached an average of 318,000 in August compared to the 330,000 from Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with the former series star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand’s coast, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit solo show without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
Seven's X-Factor remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and hit The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results at night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, produced an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators – enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire’s Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half-hour sat 720,000.
Hot-seat average 620,000.
The decline in The Chase Australia’s second evening quotas will be voted by Nine confidently that Hot Seat will eventually be enforced at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to overwhelm the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man – but who will he choose?
Revealed secrets?
Lana Jeavons Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who won The Bachelor.
The woman where Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor was covered in the highest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly praise whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-fellows the day before we became three out of two, you may have accidentally given a hint of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have lyrically missed out on why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Woods' last rose?", their answers could become the game's crook who won the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as Wood's best partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
“From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarah) and Sam’s energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought about it throughout the show,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is standing with both feet on the ground, it’s so much fun to be with her,” added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that her home visit last week made it clear that Wood could be "the One."
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game – I am now unreservedly set on him,” she said.
And when she was asked who Wood was to choose, if not her, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the rest of the girls equally - it's an indecision between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 19:30, on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the United States – and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches had banned Hayne from the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a gringle as the Aussie Rugby League convert did in his first point return on Tuesday in a 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula confided in his husband and gave Hayne the next chance to a point return and also into the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly reinforced Hayne in his press conference after the game.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his lost catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne scores at a point recovered in the first game quarter by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian succession had hoped for for his NFL debut.
After the fumble, Hayne cursed the playing field and later told Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn’t imagine a worse start in his NFL career.
“That was one thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the cutter to his original debut in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of gays
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was detained on a Siberian field with gun violence.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was condemned, his oil company Yukos was seized and his democratic efforts were halted.
Free voters are calling for the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn clause in Großwallstadt of a severe crisis at Bavarian schools, if there are no corresponding new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers" to beg the koepswaders.
"Then we will get rejections in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtagsfragment of the Free Voters will be held until Friday in the municipality of Unterfranken.
Actually, there were quite different main topics.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free voter meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlap the clause," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN refugee protection zones in Syria, as it did during the Yugoslavia War in the 1990s.
“That’s not how it goes, we have to go to the causes,” said the Free Voter Chief.
Refused asylum seekers want to dismiss the free voters as soon as possible.
For this reason, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum cases: “We also need at least 50 new asylum judges,” Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent: “We need uniform standards of federal states across the federal government.”
"Bayern is pushing away, others aren't."
“We need to be more actionable.”
However, state policy in Great Wall City should not fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot trial "middle plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the high school middle level is tested from three to four years - as a result, it will last again nine years until graduation.
But Aiwanger is not far enough.
“The G9 issue needs to be accelerated,” the FW chief said.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want to do so.
Free ride to the G9 wherever it is desired.
Stronger Wall Street Helps Dax Jump
The German stock market has closed with profits after a relentless and nervous course of trading over a long period of time.
It was only in the afternoon that a stronger uptick of the U.S. stock exchanges provided a clear direction, which ultimately drove the Dax up by 0.56 percent to 10,188.13 points.
The mid-range MDax won 0.54 percent at 19,552.88 points.
The TecDax technology-intensive increased by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.

Solid profits also booked at trading venues in London and Paris.
In the U.S., the Dow Jones index last year recorded about 1 percent more.
Many traders expect the markets to be in place until after the U.S. interest rate decision and also for a major downturn on the stock exchanges on Friday.
Discussion on the burdens of the nuclear exit has pushed RWE’s stocks to a record low in the meantime, leaving deep marks on Eon as well.
According to Spiegel, the German energy companies may lack <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion in reserves.
The federal government denies the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly afterwards, but eventually lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose at the Dax peak by another 3.22 percent.
According to one trader, a positive report by U.S. investor magazine "Barron's" appeared after the weekend.
Accordingly, investors paid too little attention to the German chip builder.
Investing in future-oriented wafer technologies and focusing on the automotive market should be paid off.
Car values were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were dropped again than in the previous year, according to the industry association Acea at the start of the International Automobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of automakers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.

Four people killed after police fired rubber gunshots on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police had used tear gas and then shot into the air before they pulled back on rubber bullets.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber shots used, which are known to kill, but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high mortality rate.
The clashes were the last weeks of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed as part of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th.
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces – an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Planned building area in the city
The property at the Emder Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000 square meter area.
A mixture of trade, trade and housing is planned - but concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a 4000 square meter property in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post Youth Centre.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, trade and housing.
You are waiting for the corresponding offers, it is said on the side of the city.
Which investor will be questioned is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The town of Emden had already purchased a part of the property, which is located on the Ringstraße / Ecke Große Straße, a few months ago and the building on it was demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement on the Small Sea at Emden take shape.
For the first time, the investor publicly presented plans for the project.
Some investors are still concerned - they fear the sale of their recreational shelter
For months, he had been negotiated, turbulent, debated and drawn behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Small Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening at the Emder Council's Urban Development Committee.
Initially, this point was on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP faction, who accused the investor and the management of secret cremation, Ralf Behrends of the system building management went to the offensive: "We have not yet an answer to all questions," he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 million project has been under discussion for months.
Violent reactions among sea buddhist owners who had come to the meeting highlighted the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the seafood and member of the Board of Directors at the stakeholder’s representation, Pro Hieve, complains: “This will be a giant clot that outnumbers all other buildings.”
In addition, like many other project critics, he fears that traffic will increase significantly due to the intended size of the facility: "There must be whole bus loads coming in order for this to happen," says Schulz.
However, what exactly happens on the well a hectare of the former guest house is still open.
There is no operator yet.
“First we need to have a conclusive concept,” said Ralf Behrends.
Because of the lack of this, the construction plans are also still variable.
Zwillings-Growing at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased with its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Diana gave birth to twins yesterday.
Geminis are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo dates back almost 50 years and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, the zoo says.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet determined, as Mother Dian has kept them close to the body so far.
First, the “picture” was reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a wide deep-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verdean islands, which has a 60 percent chance of evolving into a tropical storm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined deep-pressure system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical storm over the next two days, the weather experts stationed in Miami added.
Google launches double donation campaign to raise <0x24>11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling donation campaign to spend <0x24>11 million on humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrolled European nations as they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally raised donations will double to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugee relief to <0x24>11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria that displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For lightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for lightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study.
It’s still too early to say whether people with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
“The mortality data takes a long time to show something,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote a guide article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgeries or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgeries have proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain degree of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained approximately the same in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% fully resolved diabetes and 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, compared to this, diabetes resolved completely in only one percent and in part in only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the 'surgical' group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitor patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had more weight loss (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg) compared to the gastrectomy group, achieved greater declines in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and had more than 16% of the above, and had a total loss of 16%.
While the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years — compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgical patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the critical point of this study because it says this operation is lower in this lower BMI group,” without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have strongly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard.”
Love story plays in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently receiving increased attention in the literature: a young woman, unpopular and unpopular at school, meets the swarm of her youth again over the years, and this one falls in love with her.
Also in the recently published novel “We Are Not Actually That” by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrück readers, as it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to place a literary monument in her homeland.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot welcome all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, in the given circumstances, the interests of humanity be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, the situation is not appropriate.
"It's impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“Caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long-term solutions for how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries,” he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
“The use of violence has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions following the September 11 terror attack, stating that the U.S.’s violent response was a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in nonviolence.
“I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has had unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the use of hand sanitizers by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of income from hand sanitizers in children under 12 years, the poison control centers report, increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
“Children are getting more and more frequent access to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them land in emergency services,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants, while some do so to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectants just because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwater to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for it,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapefruit and orange fragrance, which are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizers contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, few spikes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poisoning center at Kansas University Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn’t let a bite of whisky around, but people leave these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and when children get there, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four spikes of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179 times higher than the threshold legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency physician who treated them at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed at her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate pediatric hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," Ortia Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free products or disinfectant towels and store hand sanitizers outside the reach of the child.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizers that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active substance.
In January, three fourth-grade students in the state of New York planned to poison their "general" teacher by deploying antibacterial products around the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizers and banned her from her room.
The police considered the failed plan as a "talk" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authorities.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been slightly injured in a collision on the querspange between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the querspange towards the industrial area and noticed too late that two vehicles had stopped in the circular traffic.
As a result, he jumped into the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta in front of it.
The vehicles involved in the accident were damaged in the amount of approximately 10,000 euros, the police said.
The 33-year-old’s Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be pulled off.
No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn it over again.
Hearts will fight SFA on charges of Neilson and Warburton will be cautious in January new commitments that could destroy the unit of the cadre
Dons increase leadership over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's eleventh in the first half gave Aberdeen a scarce victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to create a five-point gap between them and Celtic.
Griffiths talks about disharmony
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, insisting that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don’t think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic since there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands they no longer show the highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what interests them.
There’s a lot of tension in the old firm games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY DEILA has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League, the defeat was followed by a 10-man from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points ahead.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s going on.
We feel that way, but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Getting together now is so important.
Warburton Careful at January Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, indicating that he appealed for some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when signing new admissions and insists that he does not want to interfere with the Ibrox unit.
The former CEO of Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with retreat note
Swansea defender Michu, with Celtic in conversation during the transfer period, has indicated that he could withdraw when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been riding with an annoying knee for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA Battle for Neilson's Comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the Defender's Red Card was later revoked - Collum's third Red Card, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson insists on what he said, “I didn’t question integrity, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The unimproved Hibee was justified after he admitted to singing a song with insulting lyrics about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a bar in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer, adding, "It is safe to say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it plays for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United management
Simon Donnelly insists that the board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things around – but agrees that the downturn must end on the playing field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to get the boys on the trail again," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton "unbelievable".
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win, giving them a five-point lead to Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's elf-meter in the first half.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won everything in cup games or leagues that have never won games of this kind.”
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July at 164,000, while the number of unemployed for the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures, saying: “The government’s long-term plan has laid the foundation stone for a stronger economy.”
It is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunk people disrupted the process
As the security personnel were unable to satisfy the situation, the employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray were the officials able to take care of the disruptors.
A breathing alcohol test resulted in 0.89 promille in a 16-year-old.
The grandfather was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 proms and was initially in custody.
Why I Will Be Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I'll see how a man is put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t, I’ll be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber of Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew nearer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the U.S., and since there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five.
Those who are chosen will observe it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to take a notebook and a pen with me to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you will get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better", but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his Witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the movement's public information work will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a high probability that he's not guilty of the murder.
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this perspective, I will see him die.
I can’t claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters that you can contact for.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man Convinced to Come From Canning River After Wet Police Chase
The Canning Vale cop stayed dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the swampy and suffocating waters, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "slightly persuade him to return to the shore."
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for a house-breaking incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape towards the Canning River.
But he didn't come too far.
"He stood in the water--and said 'I'm not coming out, come and pick me up,'" Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about wetting his uniform, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiating".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Championship footballer Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car to the pits to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to plan a Ben Cousins biathlon humorous.
Peter Moody claims Stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that Racing Victoria’s Stewards have tried to install a spy in its stations last year and threatened to stop the race immediately.
He targeted the Stewards and Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were conducting a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s late scratching due to a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt tubing test at Lidaris that he can’t explain.
He had abstained for 18 months because of the spying allegations and did not want it to "look like too high hanging grapes."
“I had no intention of saying anything about it, and I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that everything comes out at once,” Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to skip the raised main thing, and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them.
If they start to think I’m not doing that, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
Then I have to think about what I do with my license.
Moody had earlier released the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy out his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I'll name when I'm asked - and offering him a job in my offices to provide information about what I'm doing inside my offices," Racing said.
Apparently they think I'm a scammer.
If that's the case, they should certainly hold on to their noses because they failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of the RVL, David Moodie, current President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Should this lead me to believe that it will be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think I'm it.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying will make them think about it now.
But now I’m at the point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer’s frustration levels have built up with the long-lasting cobalt investigation at Lidari, and late scratching led him to say that he “could throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unstoppable master Black Caviar, called the racing day-treatment rule " ridiculous" after a pack of mud or tone was applied to the horse legs, which violated the rules.
“It’s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it,” he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, whatever it was.
It was the same on the race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation into this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set these rules don’t know anything about the horse.
“We all see that we need rules, but here you’ve gone too far,” Moody said.
Man Arrested After Driver's Escape
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia joined police in Shepparton.
He is likely to be charged for driver evacuation and neglected assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Rejects Rivals on Claims of Ring Fighting
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the tackling of his players as the "agenda setting" of two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players to "ringfight" with his team during the high-storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely concealed remark to the Storm team after his team scored the final win against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model example" of the rugby league and said that the two from Queensland were not good at "in Riengen".
Bellamy defended his team's tackling leg and said they were only focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team voiced him confidently, as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It's happening again and again - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring games when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but over the last six weeks we’ve made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has given us a turn for the trend.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It’s funny how this happens over and over again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St. George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "dull" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to our on Friday night and how exciting his game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he would take care of a crappy shit about it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football – not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they’re a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match Storm vs Roosters scored higher than the match Broncos vs Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven’t seen it yet, but what was the result? 16:12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them at some stage.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the AAMI Park pre-finals.
Serb with <0x24>200,000 deposit after drug charges
A man who may be facing a life sentence for trying to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released on a <0x24>200,000 deposit.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and settled in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his co-accused in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that he could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a <0x24>200,000 security deposit to achieve his release.
“After reading both parties’ official statements, it’s clear that putting a security of <0x24>200,000 is a real financial burden,” Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to keep him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, subject to the condition that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, registers with the police daily and adheres to an exit lockdown from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: Führerhaus breaks apart
In an accident involving three trucks on highway 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday night.
Two of the three trucks involved braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to evade the left at the last moment, the police said.
The driver's cabin of the accident driver completely broke apart.
The driver was seriously wounded in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely blocked for more than six hours to 2 p.m.
There was a damage of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>122,000.
Stevan Hogg used phone by girls to attract pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while he was asleep, logged into an online messaging service from which he received a series of inappropriate pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the sleeping Hogg’s hand.
She looked through it, found the confusing reports and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and looked at the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address, and discovered "relevant" web searches that used the terms for the search for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to “pedophiles on the Internet” and then he “pretended to be a policeman to frighten them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction - that he is addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to attract them.
He said he was sick in his head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it.
The girl was interviewed and said the defendant used computers and playstations to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to taking inappropriate pictures of children on 14 June last year, violating the regulations on 25 January of this year and not appearing in court at a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to appear in the register of sexual offenders, as it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" was found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict to October to get background reports on social work.
Hogg was given a deposit in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other pending cases.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders even before the date of the verdict.
Schleuser softens on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being captured away from the main control points at the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers left people increasing at smaller border crossings because of fear of discovery and arrest
On the Austrian side, a spokesman for the Federal Police said.
More than 1,000 refugees have been detained in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and stalls.
There, they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to registration.
At Munich’s main station, according to federal police, more refugees arrived again on Wednesday, compared to the start of the week.
By 8:00 a.m. alone, some 700 people arrived in the country’s capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the re-introduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, refugees reached the city on Tuesday, 1759.
Stuttgart: runners of Tropensturm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart said.
The strong depth is the runner of the Tropical Storm "Henry", which has been pulled over the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Violent storms and storms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, even in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alp and in the Lake Continental, there are booms of 60 to 90 hour kilometres until Thursday morning.
On Friday, the sun can be seen longer.
The mass does: Every two years, the automakers at the IAA show their innovations.
2015 is especially important for the compact cars, which are currently selling very well.
Compact-class cars are currently particularly in demand: around 28.1 percent of new licenses were in this segment alone, according to the Federal Bureau of Motor Vehicles (KBA) in August.
This is also reflected at the IAA (public days 17-27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept vehicles and new high-end and luxury cars, many new compact models will be unveiled this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be with dealers in the autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” Opel chief executive Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is looking at a start-up below its biggest competitor, VW Golf, which starts at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17,650.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra comes with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
Hessen also offers additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only five-door.
As a second variant, the Combi will follow in the spring, which is already visible at the IAA.
And what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault is racing the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane.
At the fair, the Mégane can be seen exclusively as a five-door in a conventional and emphasized sporty GT version.
It will be commercialized at the beginning of next year, then as a combi.
Infiniti: All new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
With the new model, the Nissan Ableger wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the brand’s design line.
The base model will receive a petrol engine with a power output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
But there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model will be offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The Baleno will be launched in Europe in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the prestigious Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n lighthouse put their hands on the front: Here the cooler grill was redesigned and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been mainly modernized, the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and Apple’s CarPlay integrated for the first time.
In addition, a series of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are coming together at the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are deserving of human dignity
The Federal Constitutional Court has granted rights to an ex-prisoner of the judiciary service Tegel, who had been staying in a too small cell for months.
Due to the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can hope for money even if they were confined to too narrow spaces for only a few days (1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space at the Berlin-Tegel justice station between June and November 2009; the toilet was not spatially separated.
After that, the man, who is now on his own, according to his lawyer, was transferred to a larger cell.
His official lawsuit for the unworthy conditions of detention against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Judges lifted the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and referred the case back there for re-examination.
They see the human dignity of the man being violated.
The Court of Appeal now decides on the amount of compensation
Although, for legal reasons, only a few days of detention for the compensation would be decisive for the period in question, there was a compensation claim, it said.
Otherwise, it would be "an oversight of the legal protection of the personality".
The court must now clarify the amount of the damages.
In the past, the Constitutional Courts have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
It was not until April that they paid compensation to a prisoner because he was locked naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had testified to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 that he was deserving of human dignity.
The plaintiff was housed in a cell similar to the Karlsruhe case for more than three months every day between 15 and 21 hours.
The Berlin prisons had also come to the headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of personnel.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly locked up for 23 hours, the aggressiveness is increasing, even to squabbles it is said to have already arrived because of the tense situation.
According to information from the judiciary press, 21 jobs in Tegel are not occupied due to a shortage of offspring, 19 are due to disappear in 2016.
Angela Merkel and Refugee Policy: “We are doing this”
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What is going on in Germany?
Approximately 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate one million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do it, and we can do it."
What comes to Germany is given by the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
That’s almost twice as much as it has been built so far (250000 apartments).
But the lack of housing is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: 60,000 to 80,000 social apartments fall out of the rental price constraint each year, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favorable apartments.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding from 518 million to one billion euros.
From the Pestel Institute’s point of view, this is far too little: 80,000 social housing should be created annually, and the federal government should invest 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to the Institute for Labour and Occupational Research, it is assumed that 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them enter, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial that they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the hosting society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Threnhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there used to be a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence obligation that restricted asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, the majority has adopted the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly, even due to the lack of skilled workers.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of German skills.
So far, there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, according to Thränhardt, the road to work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the kitas, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: “It is very important for derailed parents to keep the family together,” says Ilja Koschembar, spokeswoman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
However, to convince the family of the benefits of the kita, the administration distributes handbooks in different languages.
Should the demand for educators increase significantly due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example by allowing more vocational schools.
In the countries, students without German proficiency are prepared for the lesson in welcome classes.
But they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German Students’ Association estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal government prohibits the study of asylum seekers or patients - the only exception so far was Berlin, but Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Student-willed refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
As a result, refugees with a residence permit or tolerance will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Applications Act when they start their studies.
The latter generally do not receive a bafög as they do not fall under the circle of bafög-entitled persons.
Patient refugees have had to live in Germany for four years to be entitled to Bafög, and from 1 January 2016 this range will be shortened to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, demands Steffen Krach, Berlin’s Secretary of State for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should get bafög right away.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, as many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that professionally takes care of the newcomers.
Rights also include responsibilities.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and to give it certain controls.
This includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, on Thursday expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to austere such conflicts in Germany "have immediately their right to stay here, in Germany", he said in the Bavarian radio station.
He proposed translating the Constitution into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more a subject of the whole society than it is today.
As a result, the majority society will also have to change, and the abolition of discrimination and racism will become more pressing.
Germany, however, has, as a result of European decisions, had an anti-discrimination body and a General Equality Act for almost a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long called for and what international agreements such as the Anti-Rassism Convention impose on Germany must become a reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and uses its new citizens to the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the refugees so far expected, says doctor president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man-power and capacity are concerned, we can do that," he told the Daily Mirror.
However, additional money will have to flow into the system.
In order to avoid shortcomings, Montgomery urges all arrivals to hand out health cards immediately upon registration.
Subsequent payments could be made with the federal governments.
And in the long run, it is highly questionable to feed as many people with the limited catalogue of services provided for by the Asylum Applicants Act.
Otherwise, the doctors will primarily create the language barriers.
So far, Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown, migrants are getting worse informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctor’s practices, interpreter costs would have to be borne, she demands.
Many refugees would, however, be helped with more general medical facilities in emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it is HIV education.
But with the partially other disease images, German doctors are clear of their training, Montgomery says.
"Parasite infection or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as far as the doctor's deficiency is concerned, refugees may even be able to see relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and many refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be allowed to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to the Federal Psychotherapeutic Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, says Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study by TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrive in Germany traumatized.
Those who suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart rate and fear of death, among other things.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe dread and emotional deafness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only 4% of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social media, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social studies, most of the time, specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misunderstandings, Munz says.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new stage "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw any age group into the bans of fascinating acrobatics, animal breeding and unique entertainment.
Now the circus probst invites you to dream of washing in the manege on the brick.
"Our passion is the circus."
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probst, an animal teacher and junior head.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current mannequin stage.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
“It’s important for us to get people out of their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” the 27-year-old junior boss said.
"Manegencocktail with Weltstadt-Flair", so director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometre-long tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with jokes and charms.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craftsmanship.
With the heroes of the silent films, the Cuban duo wants to take it loosely.
Ease and mobility - with these words they identify.
Her humorous art at the mast is meant to capture women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of the circus probst also fascinates with fingertip feeling and articulation.
Balance with the one-wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little as others and fascinated with its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst, emphasizes.
Mistakes in the attitude of circus animals are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also commented: “If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well.”
Approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each strike unit.
The "four-legged artist", as they are lovingly called, will be read from the eyes if possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn’t feel comfortable, it doesn’t want to get into the manege either.
The ultimate commandment is to take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebrastute, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together in a hamlet for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," Brigitte Probst says.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
"One is for sure," says Stephanie Probst, "whether five or 1200 spectators, we always give our best and are there with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances from 17 to 20 September at 5:00 and 8:00 a.m. daily.
The program starts on Sunday at 11am and 4pm.
Thursday is family day, for the show at 5:00 p.m. the prices are discounted.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe Speaks Wrong in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread through social media.
The opening of Parliament was also saddened by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and they were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with whistleblowers.
Last month they had dumped him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians had received SMS messages on their phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe’s speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Dead'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity in Parliament ends, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to Reduce Up to 30,000 Jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the company’s restructuring and savings efforts.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fastest-growing company hardware and service operations.
The expected job cuts will lead to over <0x24>2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today, and we have a broad and deeper portfolio of businesses that support businesses in the transition to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than <0x24>50 billion in annual revenue and "will be focused on providing unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for businesses," the company said in a statement.
It breaks down a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Palo Alto Garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to deal with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this field, based on the belief that tight-focused companies are delivering better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger pointed out to Wilshere that it will only be September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can’t play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England, and given his history, his participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain next summer.
The great shame about this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate knee injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre-season.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal’s 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six of eight seasons since 2007/08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have the most injury days to record.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat strength," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal will start their Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger will start a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are expected to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give players who need it a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to continue through Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the largest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is still unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring on the judge's scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn lessons from last season’s Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup trophy with its management.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked for Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I have been in the business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: The Comedy Show That Gives Us Serious Lessons About Men's Friendships
The lack of similar performances in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year-old high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of Man, with the aim of questioning culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a “healthy mood,” his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halve the risk of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have the need to appear strong, viable and successful, doubled, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much more deeply.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can’t buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which glowed through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments of soccer watching in cozy chairs, and Ross’ desire for Rachel – all of that came from knowing that men can relate to it in any case, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
“My listening role for people who feel depressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference,” he said.
The men who contact us often don’t feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying “I can handle it” has a huge effect on how it feels to be perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men’s friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you’re visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned scenery to celebrate the day, why not take your friends to a drink at the Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria will meet at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and help PSG move to Malmö.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who put the French champion on the road, but after that they missed a number of occasions before finally raising their lead when Cavani scored in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only aim to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they scored, it was not a class game by Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic missed chances before the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club, with which he began his illustrious career as early as 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it's a good start to win 2:0, cause problems to our opponents and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect during the season," Blanc said.
"That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven’t scored one or two more goals.”
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which was able to hold a 2–2 draw against Bordeaux in the First League at the weekend, but he was kicked out in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing storm was named as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted why when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense, before taking Johan Wiland to the next level.
However, if someone thought that PSG would achieve a big victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat the Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield a heavy opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far to Kevin Trapp's posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG himself sometimes gave up, with some mistakes and bad conclusions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who paused in no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then gave up after Cavani had deployed him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria turned into a spin shot that was bent by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the pole ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, with the Uruguayan achieving his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thought that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the end result low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was announced a goal at the end.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was playing a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough.”
Hut away from Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises <0x24>2.5 billion through equity sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, affected by falling commodity prices, raised <0x24>2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt recovery plan.
The London-based company Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn pushes demand and destructively impacts markets.
The issue of reference rights brought Glencore's stock price on trading early Wednesday morning to a rapid rise at the top of the London stock exchange.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week a <0x24>2.5 billion share sale as part of a more comprehensive plan to repay around a third of its <0x24>30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reached the municipality of Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees are from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest person who arrives is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House confirms Xi Jinping’s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, takes place on September 25, and is a response to President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, but at the same time give President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively," he said.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington, before moving to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
It is expected that Obama and Xi will address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and its increasing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports cars borrowed and driven to rubbish
A 29-year-old wanted to make a dream come true and lay down a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway came the evil awakening.
At a company in Gotha County, you can fulfill your dream and once lend and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
This was also the case with a 29-year-old from Gotha County.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, crashed on a wet track into the mud and drove into the driver's seat.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 switch to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
A few years ago, FC Bayern were obviously ahead of the commitment of Spain’s Superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight-time Spanish champion, three-time cup winner, four-time Champions League winner, two-time club world champion, two-time European champion, one-time world champion - Xavi's title list is stunning.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now tells us that he was already ahead of the 2008 European Championships before his farewell from Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
“Madrid won everything at the time, we didn’t win anything,” he said.
This was also recorded by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Romaniegge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
The change, however, did not happen.
And the decisive man is working for German record champion Pep Guardiola today.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has contracted Guardiola and I played a great EM."
“Pep told me that I wouldn’t change, that he couldn’t imagine the team without me.”
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern’s 2008/2009 season would have been with Xavi?
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against the Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn, switching off the reds (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrating the Kings-Class triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she would not be needed behind the scenes.
During a sequel to HBO's Sunday Night, Project Greenlight interrupted the experienced actor Brown when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the selected screenplay of the project.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it when the film is on, not when the show is on,” Damon said.
Brown reacted shocked, with outraged disbelief, and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay" as the comments of the actor from The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show’s finalists.
“I would like to urge people to think about – whoever the director is – how they treat the character of harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she's a nut who is beaten by her white donor.
The producer of Dear White People advocated for Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for directing rights to the film; Damon replied that her director "in the end could give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded before disapproval over Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip, writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain his diversity - that's SO WAY it hurts".
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took action nationwide and pushed lawmakers and authorities to impose discriminatory practices against color restraint.
In February, the singer Prince made a hint at the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
“Albums Still Matter,” he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
Recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media prospects invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowned first champion
Professional sports climber and assistant Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and take home the <0x24>1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which had just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a contestant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to reach the final.
Last task was to climb on a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time, making him the first athlete to complete the engaging Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard-hit victory, still under the shock of winning the <0x24>1 million Grand Prix.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about how I’ve never earned more than <0x24>10,000 or had to live,” Isaac E! said of his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine what this is like... the future is unknown.
Leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britons, although he was the first to finish the course at all, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time,” Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful prize and life changes, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's making any fuss about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
He received lots of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone should beat me, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, which will start shooting in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers pass Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Once they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers were reduced to their role as a spoiler, but this game played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins lost a chance to climb within half of the Houston Astros game for the second American League Wildcard place.
For Detroit, though only for one evening, it was a return of the three-letter F-Wort, which was so difficult to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it comes," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
“I want to end this year strongly,” Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and so I want to get into the game fully concentrated.
Tiger-designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He's shaved the punch well," Ausmus said.
He looked good on the pitch, looked much better on the bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs in the back at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a spot, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated rookie striker Miguel Sano, who entered a two-run to right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the finishing run in the second, the third baseman, Trevor Plouffe, made a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe hit a Double Play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall scored an RBI double against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon and scored a 5-4 standing.
The right-hander, however, kicked Sano out on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from the start of the game from a still-moving Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been removed from the injury list before the game after missing more than a month due to back pain.
"Obviously not the beginning I wished for," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt like I was going to make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the Leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, which created a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez scored his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center fielder Anthony Gose to the 3-0.
“That was a big blow,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn’t hit very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the right-handed Reliever A.J.Achter.
Hughes scored three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez shot out due to an injury to the shoulder.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injury list since mid-August due to a shoulder tear, is expected to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 on four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 due to a crack in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people in the area are to be accommodated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
It had 450 to 750 refugees arriving.
Several sports halls in the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, 7,500 people have arrived in Hessen, according to the government office responsible for the first recruitment.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria is an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German involvement in Syria a possibility.
"I believe that a decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused European states of "collectively disregarding".
Four years ago, one was happy that the cup of military involvement in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict is crashing at our doorstep," he told German radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees.
Austria controls its southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not sent refugees back to Austria either.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
Asked about an agreement that would allow Germany to accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Its target is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
So far, EU countries have not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
At a special meeting on Tuesday (September 22nd), the EU interior ministers want to take a new step towards the binding distribution of another 120,000 refugees.
Given the strong refugee resettlement in Germany, the Federation wants to support countries more strongly in the first-hand reception and distribution of people.
The federation will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after nearly four hours of talks with the prime ministers at the Chancellor’s office in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection are also fighting them.
But those who have no prospect of staying can’t stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a “giant effort of force”.
Thousands of desperate refugees are now trapped on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometre-long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also lock the border to Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent tractorers from seeking outbound routes across Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had averaged the fence.
According to eyewitness reports, thousands of more migrants were on their way to the Greek border in Turkey.
Cassini spacecraft finds ocean on Saturn Moon Enceladus
Under the ice panzer of Saturnmond Enceladus, a global ocean is swinging.
This is what researchers conclude from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Accordingly, the moon dims slightly on its orbit around the ring planet.
This dwarf movement is small but still too large for a permanently fixed celestial body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
In 2006, Cassini discovered ice volcanoes at the southern pole of Saturnmond, spying water vapor and ice particles, feeding the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least on the south pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean has not been clarified.
Rama is missing in 1860 Munich for several weeks
The 1860 Munich must give up the offensive agent Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation found an adducer injury in the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had already complained about pain earlier this week.
According to Münchner Löwen, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced pause".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a good loss."
"Of course, we need to think now," sports director Necat Aygün told the "Picture" newspaper in view of the possible commitment of a non-professional.
However, as a training guest, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously also contracted with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove its capabilities".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie may return to team training next week after his stroke.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is scheduled to take part in running training.
Okotie was injured in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent collision with the head.
Against his first fears, however, he remained without a serious blessing.
No diet fruit - Mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often more likely to be distracted from them.
Mangoes contain a relatively high amount of sugar – especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Most importantly, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet foods.
A mango, however, also gives hearty dishes a special note.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leafy salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
U.S. package service UPS is releasing up to 95,000 grants for Christmas business in the U.S.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Drivers are primarily being sought.
As of last year, UPS had increased its workforce by 95,000 subsidies for the holiday season.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor, FedEx, have been making arrangements earlier this year to be ready for the Christmas business.
In 2013, delayed deliveries brought harsh criticism to the package services.
First the fjohnsturm, then the marked cold front
The next night, in the valleys of the Alps north side of the hairdryer, MeteoSwiss announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and at night to Thursday the hairdryer partly blows with stormy weather through the hairdryers.
On Thursday morning we will have a significant cold front that will bring heavy rains, windsurfs and a drop in temperatures.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently at the forefront of an extensive low-pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the alpine north side, at night to Wednesday, the hairdryer breaks through the valleys.
As a result, until Thursday morning, the hair dryer blows into the hair dryer valleys with booms of 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urneland, partly also with over 100 km/h.
The hairdryer can travel from time to time to the neighbouring central country, and even hurricanes of over 120 km/h are possible on the mountains.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryers provide summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, humidity begins to stagnate on the southern slope of the Alps.
It is raining here, which lasts until Thursday night.
In total, in the south of the Alps over the next 48 hours, some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be calculated, after heavy rains have fallen in recent days.
On Thursday morning, the hairdryer airs out, as a result of which a cold front rolls over Switzerland with strong, partly white-white rain from west to east.
Together with the cold front, the wind cools up strongly to stormy, and the temperatures drop significantly.
The following days are present in the north in autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, in the south, on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of the city president Ignazio Marino, an unnamed square in the park on the Oppio hill was named after the German reformer on Wednesday.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The nomination was requested by the working community of evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, a pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the Popes, as a minority, could often only secretly live their faith.
With the square, it becomes visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of the Christian faith is welcomed in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) remained as a young Augustine monk at the turn of the year 1510/11 for several months in Rome.
He felt the city at that time as a sin-offering.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him, according to historians, in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther then, with his thesis against the settlement trade, initiated the division of the Church of the evening.
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
Was it the word at the beginning?
No, not at the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
At the beginning, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has been retained by the 75-year-old - but this is by no means equivalent to "hearing" images.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite dark.
For about three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subject areas of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have been created that focus on topics such as the crossroads, the plague, the commandments, or our fathers.
He thus spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who, based on the painting, has dealt with the respective Bible passages.
He has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Old Painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quote of Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry band has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows twice as much insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Lordhuter Order.
"That's when the education was done with the pipestock," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I've tried to work this out, so that maybe I can get through with the Lord Father again."
His second concern is to help art regain more value in a fast-paced time: "The perception of image worlds is today marked by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolically, they are being pushed out.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this regard, I am a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to “invade” the images, let them act on themselves, discover and feel the power they have: “The image is looking for its opposite.”
Klaus Altepost said on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible at the Otmar-Alt Foundation that he "always" has been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Old did not pay attention to fully grasping the Bible, but chose the topics that were important to him, including mystical themes.
"It was not cooperation at eye level," says Altepost: "This is all about the images, the text explains only."
For Hans Möhler of the Luther publishing house, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt’s images speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and the language of responsibility.
Part of the original paper and canvas paintings will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15 at the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Construction start for BMX-Train near
Planned, found space, commissioned companies, modeled Erdhügel for a round course: a year later, almost everything was finished – but before the official opening of the BMX railway, it was already finished.
Failures in politics and administration caused confusion, especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the train.
So hills were postponed, looking for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be given in October, the first municipal councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to announce in the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year will be visible," she said.
The work on the former indoor swimming pool should then be started without a further "remembering break".
DFB Intensifies Engagement for Refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga sets a clear mark on the weekend.
Soccer responds to the situation in Germany and ensures its assistance to the policy in addressing the upcoming problems.
“I think that’s the biggest challenge for our country since the reunification.”
“In principle, no one can say that it has nothing to do with me, I have nothing to do with it.”
"It must be of interest to everyone to take this issue into account," said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be at the Chancellor's office next Wednesday and meet with Minister of State Ms. <0xC3><0x96>zo<0xC4><0x9F>uz and the Chancellor there."
“This will certainly play a central role,” he said.
Soccer can and will help.
But the decisive lines have to set the policy.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
“With the Egidius-Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019,” Niersbach said at the outskirts of the UEFA event in St. Julian’s/Malta.
There are also some federal governments that support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professionals will put a clear sign when they will wear the inscription "We help - <0x23>refugeeswelcome" on the left sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," Leverkusen's sports manager Rudi Völler of the "Image" newspaper (Tuesday) said, calling the project "of course".
"The refugee drama goes to everyone, no one can go away."
“We can, no, we have to use our radiance, our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly,” said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
On Friday, the women’s national team will invite 100 refugees to Halle/Saale to qualify for the European Championship against Hungary.
Niersbach called the support of refugees "a great community work of German football".
The fact that all 36 license associations have started their own projects in their locations is great.
It’s just as great that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" we have spent is alive in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000 each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already collected the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software group, Bill McDermott, has lost his left eye in a fall in early July, according to several reports.
In the accident on the staircase in his brother’s home in the United States, he fell on a glass of water that he wore in his left hand after midnight, the “Economic Week” reported on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, was powerless, then pulled himself out onto the street - that's what he told us last week," said SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott could do his job.
"In early October we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and was "completely employable".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full for SAP there, full in my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott said.
McDermott usually travels between Germany and the US, but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important for him to go to the public with such a personal story, said the manager of the SZ: "Anyone can do this."
"It's important to get up again when you fall."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of combat...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and stated that he suffered the injury when he crashed from the wheel.
Therefore, at the weekend night race in Singapore, he does not come as much as a reserve driver for the two tribal pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as he did a week later at the Japan Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller im Tor
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for Marco Reus’s return in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken.
The national player will also be missed by the leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00/Sky).
"Unfortunately, we can't take him back," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach said: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday."
Given the high load of its professionals, Tuchel will not only change its trunk on the Reus position.
So he announced a change to the gatekeeper position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He is training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, if Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League games in the future, Tuchel left open.
Probably he will also fight the second game.
The research statement by co-player Reus that the final draw for the BVB in the Europa League should be the goal is understandable to midfielder Julian Weigl: "That's not so wrong with Marco."
“I think we have a good chance of winning the title.”
Robot cars: government wants to be a pioneer for Germany
Germany is expected to be a technological pioneer in changing the car at the will of the German government.
The Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides for investments in the development of digital infrastructure, among other things.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the IAA Automesse about a "new age of mobility".
Automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and reduce traffic blockage, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who will also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport’s strategy paper underlines, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital audio.
A test track is currently being developed for testing new technology on Highway 9 in Bavaria.
In order for the driver "to be charged no additional liability risks", the federal government wants to "review the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany intends to work internationally to increase the permissible maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
In addition, the Federal Government is committed to an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In the case of automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver becomes more and more the passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated driving on highways will be technically possible by 2020.
However, driverless vehicles on public roads are "first to be expected far after 2020".
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at Germany’s location is estimated by the authors of the study to be around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," SPD traffic policymaker Sören Bartol said.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the security of the driver’s personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the test organisation Dekra, presented on Wednesday at the AA, concludes that only 8 percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be implemented in the next 10 years, 32 percent do not expect it to be over 20 years.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, while in the US, 33 percent.
Nonetheless, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give up control over the entire ride on all roads.
On the highway, that could be 15 percent in the flowing traffic, in the stall 45 percent.
Nearly one in four would not leave the car under any circumstances.
Boll Announces Team and Double Start at Table Tennis
According to the current state of play, the Düsseldorfer wants to win the titles from September 25th to October 4th.
The final decision is to be taken no later than September 22.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys learned it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to win the title without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight at that time on a long-term sponsorship date in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo, we are no longer such a clear favorite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who led the seat list in Yekaterinburg, was also reminiscent of the 2013 European Championship in Schwechat.
At that time, Timo was missing too, and we became European champions.
“That’s what we should be orienting ourselves,” explained the fifth world rankings.
Manchester United England national footballer Luke Shaw has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a fracture in the 20-year-old fellow of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax-figure gravel cabinet: designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: showcase dolls that, thanks to video projections, look terrifyingly human.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna’s stage outfits – and that he put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I'm the child terrible of Haute Couture because I have white hair."
“It used to be white, now it’s real,” Gaultier said.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From Burgersteig to the runway), which is to be seen from September 18 in the art hall of the Hypo-Culture Foundation, it is a fortune that the fashion designer has initially taken his refusal attitude to a look over his person.
Actually, he was against it, because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal, Canada, and in Paris Station.
"It's so much more than just beautiful clothes," said Roger Diederen, director of the Kunsthalle.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the barely overlooked work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever completing an education.
Chronologically, the show is not constructed, but it is an excellent choreographed overall artwork, for which a lot of effort was made: For example, to hairdress the dolls, a stylist was engaged in particular.
According to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material have been transported to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was another special schmankerl: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and people who are a little different," Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy is also seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer’s first stylish fashion walks.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he wore his teddy bra and clothes, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll would not have been allowed by his parents.
He later learned about fashion design himself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
I bought it later, of course.
For his first fashion show, he could not pay the models.
They didn’t get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauener tip as a fashion niche
In the past, the long knitting machines used to do ploughing to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and spikes were created in large quantities for customers, who processed them further into, for example, ceilings and curtains.
This alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the fashion top Plauen.
Fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plaunian peak, fashion played a larger role, then was pushed away by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: tops in jewelry, accessories like pockets and regional outfits.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which lends itself to past styles, creates an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies, Modespitze Plauen is a member of the Branchenverband Plauener Spitze und Stickereien.
Only you are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have been broken.
Private shops and also wholesale there are almost no more.
Our products are hardly reaching the customer in this way.
The mass goods are now much cheaper in the Asian area and are sold almost exclusively through chains.
In addition, exports to Russia and the United States are weak.
There are enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to point out through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: “Since this year, we have been conducting a quality seal that shows that we are producing environmentally and socially compatible.”
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used."
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Snowberg outdoors of the Western Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroideries and tops.
To counteract the competition from the Asian area, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and companies that need to think economically,” says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
In some places the machine stitches small balls.
Bianca Hallebach-Krausse, the Plauen gold forging champion, was inspired by this: "Earlier I couldn't start anything with traditional Plauen tip".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it embodies the pattern in silver.
“Many people in the region are identifying with the topic of Plauen’s tip – young and old,” Reuters said.
It also delivers to the U.S., Australia and Finland – especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want to be a reminder.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney is planning a new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends should not be touched, but Disney still dares a new film from its classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to Entertainment Weekly, it is not a new film, but a kind of sequel that plays with the magical little girl 20 years after the first film.
It is about the experiences of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already set: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the movies.
Xi urges to open the economy broader to the world
The economy needs to open itself broader to the outside in order to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday a group tasked with guiding the reform.
"China should endeavour to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for Deepening a Comprehensive Reform.
Promoting new start-ups and pushing for reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE), private capital, and overhaul of the population reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list will be created, identifying sectors and companies that are not in question for investments.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important as it assigns a greater role to the market in allocating resources, ensuring a rule of law business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also ease control over the powers transferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their duties and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a hearing.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predators
The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predators, thereby limiting a significantly higher dose of nerve poisoning to consumers.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which presents a relevant EU working paper, sharply criticized the plans: “The risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are being communicated with full zeal to pregnant and young children,” explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of nerve poisoning for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are expected to be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic policy reasons".
However, large predators are already so heavily loaded with mercury that about 50 per cent of the catches cannot be sold on the basis of the limits still in force.
After doubling the limits, only 14.5 percent would be non-sellable.
In return for this loosening, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
However, Foodwatch referred to this as a “trick” because smaller fried fish, such as carp, are usually so low-loaded that they already comply with the planned peaks today.
The decline in small fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction that only helps the economy," Wolfschmidt said.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched through the food chain, especially in predators.
The federal government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause unborn damage to the nervous system".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment on its homepage, however, explains that a "health hazard to the general population" is not expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through the combustion of coal.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal power plants are pumping out more than six tons of mercury per year, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish in Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube, for example, was “permanently exceeded and extensively,” the “mirror” quoted in March from the paper.
Last year, European-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU’s RASFF warning system.
