Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people went out to the meeting again, the Russians were unable to break up
As the participants of the event told the agency, the Hersonites managed to hold a rally before arriving on the site for the deployment of military equipment.
"We managed to hold a meeting. Now the RF technology has arrived there," - said one of the participants of the event.
Earlier, locals traditionally gathered for protests in Svoboda Square - near the ODA building and the district.
This area, like the building, is now under the control of armed Russian troops, who use weapons against the participants of the rally and kidnapping people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As reported by Ukrinform, residents of Donetsk regularly conduct peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against the people, they are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian intruders kidnap residents of the area.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyi awarded Herson a special title "City of Heroes".
On February 24, President RF Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops fire and destroy key infrastructure facilities, carry out mass shootings of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages with the use of artillery, reactive fire systems and ballistic missiles.

If Nazar operates from 5:30, it can be used by any train:
Zelensky: Mariupol – the heart of war, will stop fighting – we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war – and if the U.S. forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and occupy the de-occupied territories again.
“Maryupol is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
We fight, we fight, we fight.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city – ed.) are people who have drawn a large number of enemies to themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (region) of the OECD, and if they are stronger, the table of talks will be closer to us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, then we may not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it, too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we find out.
We believe in our results, in our victory...”
Details: Zelensky also said that going to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians is difficult, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they are in us".
“People will see peace in any case, because people want this war to end,” he said.
On our terms, the conditions of independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something – and I don’t think any peace will satisfy them under any conditions.
But if we don’t speak emotionally, the war must end in peace, or it will end in millions of casualties.
And even where there are a million casualties, everything comes to an end of the war.
We have to fight, but for life.
You can’t fight for dust when there’s nothing left, there’s no people.”

As a result of the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, state study
the Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows you to come to the analysis of the postmodernist context as such, where the metaphor plays the role of the axiological criterion

The main intelligence department of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine has published a list of Russian military personnel who participated in the commission of military crimes in the city of Butch Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, the Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine reports on this in Facebook.
“Each Ukrainian should know their names!
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine has obtained a list of 64 military personnel of a separate motor-shooter brigade, who are directly involved in the committing of military crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha.
In the GUR IMO notes that for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine all war criminals will stand before the court and will be held accountable.
You can view the list by linking.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Butch, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were freed from Russian invaders.
In liberated cities and villages, mass killings by Russian military civilians have been recorded.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, reported that 280 people were buried in the tombs of the brothers.
Attorney General Irina Venedictova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the Russian invaders of the Kyiv region.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The army of Russian intruders shoot and destroy key infrastructure objects, carry out mass shootings of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages with the use of artillery, artillery, reactive systems of fireworks, tanks.
Good morning, I'm sorry, but I won't be able to work with you because I'll be flying to Canada soon.

Professions that offer. Is it possible without the knowledge of the language?
It's important, if there is such a tradition, then I need to know that I prepare)
I was thinking a week later, but we're getting hotter.
There may be a bad connection on the road tomorrow.
I am grateful to everyone for the experience, even if it hurts.
I believe that I have brought experience from every situation for myself so as not to repeat mistakes in the future.
Directives shall be introduced in the form of numerated written supplements which are part of this Regulation.

Your wife is not angry that you are on the phone.
In my daily prayers I thank God and the Virgin Mary for you.

My heart belongs to you.
Would you mind if I came right after the war?
place, day and time will be specified according to the interests and opportunities
We promised that when you went to school, we'd bring you a surprise.
Bulob is great , I have money for two months rent, in Olomouc district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of civilians north of Kiev.
Photographs of tortured and shot people have confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people are asking each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?! How?!
And I wasn't surprised at all. It's exactly what happened to me with sadness and waiting...
I took children and older parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then girls-colleagues with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently assisted ZSU and have not doubted for a moment that in the event of the occupation of Kiev, the capital will not spare my family.
For I have been and remain absolutely certain that the essence of the ruthless Communist-CDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my ancestors was shot in a prison in the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago in the Zhytomyr SBU was allowed to take a copy of the grandfather’s shooting case: the whole case is more than a hundred pages, and the execution sentence is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was unwritten, denied the guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "one-court" way, never walked in the cliffs.
The fact that they lived in the huts and had a few cows was enough to feed the butcher and feeder of minor children to death.
The family didn’t even know where the funeral was.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village at the time and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case is the name of the striker Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I am not surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
The apple from the apple near, as you know, falls...
The shooting trio, which led to the death of peasants, was ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of the grandfather, he was interested in various information resources.
There are in Russia excellent (without sarcasm) information resources such as "Immortal barrak", which qualitatively remind of the events of those years.
Thus, in modern Russia, the descendants of NKVDists found ways to punish and exterminate almost all who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of the victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers – the system initially discredited and then destroyed.
It's like they found files of child pornography on the computer, they were put in prison for it, and there he died quickly.
The KGB is now killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
There are concentrated the most ugly traits of human nature.
Over the millennial ordinary tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th century were imposed.
And then over what came out, they did a stunning genetic experiment, cutting off intelligence during a few waves of red terror.
Look at the 1992 semi-French film "Chequist", that's all.
That's why you saw my pictures in the bathtub.
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from a cough?
I'm sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.
I still wanted to ask maybe you know where the kids went, because Galia can't sign them
Anyway, Igor asks if it's convenient for you to drive tomorrow? (he's out and can go, because the car hasn't been seen at the station today).
We're not comfortable bothering you so much.
You are very helpful to us, thank you!!

And I have a problem with this, if I don't love a person, nothing will work out.
Yes, we took it home and took my dad right away.
She was very grateful, and she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help the Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it was possible there might be another old blanket and pillow.
But it's not necessarily. Only if it is. I'm very grateful to you too.
I was so sorry for him.
Before him, my best friend was killed.
I had a lot of questions to God about why there are situations in my life that just made me disbelieve in everything.

In the app water phono I can neither change the tariff so I have normal calls and the internet neither fill the number.
I'm out of my mind.
Where the price isn't the cheeks, and the face... the title doesn't sound right, what did you mean?
I am ashamed to sit without work.
I just wrote that in school in class.
Sorry I was worried, I was just worried.
But that’s closer to leaving the borders of Ukraine to know for sure that they’re coming.
Because it is now in question in all life.
Yes. Size for 10-11 years. But our sizes do not match. Everything needs to be measured

As reported by "European Truth", Welt writes about this with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the relevant proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 yards, including the training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As is also offered in the variant of the BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While the tanks in the battle have to pick up relatively close to the enemy's targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to the Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled squirrels will go according to the circular scheme.
In the shortest possible time, the Federal Reserve will provide Kiev with 100 of its wastes, and the gaps that have been formed will then be filled with industry in the second stage.
The first new buckets can be delivered 30 months after signing the contract, i.e. earlier in the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Are we together in the first half of the day or in the second half of the day?

Tell me how to get to the city center?
I'll share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is the secret of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman solve the issues themselves in their family, especially without the participation of the relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take a while for us to be around.
Why not try it that way yet?
I rented a car for 9 people, we'll come with Mariana and your family.

How do you feel today? <0xF0><0x9F><0x98><0x85> after the celebration?
Hello, sorry, I just woke up, I slept badly
Sorry to bother you.
I was saddened that Cola and I started to translate the test badly yesterday.
I will ask whether Gregory Denisenko or perhaps Yonashek)) to help me at least a little with mathematical concepts.
Can I be useful to them as well?
If that's the case, I'd like to add mathematical terms on the weekends.
Geometry in general is difficult, but we have to work with Cole to make it without mistakes.
Thank you for the test assignment.
We also very much hope for this.
So she's very happy with any gift.
Yab wanted to connect to her Czech number to the internet
Yesterday at the bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stand aside.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thanked God for this girl, because she was the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in Hall No. 29 is specifically designed for the submission and processing of applications for assistance
It turned out that I ordered a replacement card.
It's not worth it, I'm just a human being.
So that she was not afraid that no one came.
I didn't go. Yes, I was hot. It's me! The main thing that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
Are you going out of town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Memorial Center of the Holocaust Babin Yar in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the honour to speak after the three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of “a common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in a territorial integrity, peaceful and safe Europe.
We must protect this foundation – it’s also part of our responsibility for our history.”
“If the evil demons of the past appear in new clothes today,” he said, “for us Germans, there can be only one answer to this: never again!
The fight has to continue.”
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving the inhabitants of its blocked cities and letting them die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles shootings in Babi Yar.
For over a month, the Germans have seen this in the news in real time.
Yes, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which was not so long ago impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy weapons necessary to Ukraine.
But "Never Again!" means not only to oppose swastika.
This means to fight with all possible means against mass murders, genocide, war crimes and felony.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the monsters that are happening in Ukraine.
I'll sing a song for you at night
We agree, arrange for a trip, and write when to be collected
All the sick only Lydia did not get sick in them was omicron a new type of covid
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
I use this card instead of the card.
Call for documents to be late.
The ticket cost me a guided tour of 2000 June
Sergey Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of the respondents were "in favour".
After the Revolution of Gidnya, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbass, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, grew.
After the beginning of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have set a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among the citizens of Ukraine – more than 75%.
Despite support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the help NATO is doing in the war, there are now many criticisms at the expense of the Alliance and members of the country – for the untimely supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to close the sky.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up its desire to join the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it is able to stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military.
In the new episode of the podcast "The Promised Questions" are a scam, together with the editor of "European Truth", we talk about how exactly the Alliance helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, why NATO should be criticized, and why the Alliance can be criticized in vain, why is it that the Alliance is close
What do you think is here
I have a volt partner indicated that my statement is under consideration.

After a while, he came back again and apologized to me.
I refused him.
After a while, he called that he had had surgery on his heart.
I just wanted to talk to him, I felt sorry for him.
I’ve been psychologically supportive of him for almost six months.
During this time, we talked a lot.
At the same time, I had problems at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
That's mutual assistance.
And I was wondering, maybe we really need to look at him differently.
And he invited me to get married, and two days later he died.

The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "never did this before"
Konashenkov’s direct speech: “We see attempts of diversion and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian Armed Forces will strike the decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army had previously refrained.
The Russians have launched missile strikes on Kiev since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles, which were shot down by the Ukrainian PPO system, fell on a multi-apartment house in the capital of Pozniak.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a multi-story rocket on Valery Lobanovsky's avenue.
On March 1, the Russians got into television on Dorogozhich near Babi Yar, as a result of which 5 passers-by died.
On March 2, Ukrainian PPO systems shot down Russian rockets over South Railway Station, which flew in the direction of the building of the Ministry of Defence.
On March 14, the crashes of a broken rocket of the occupants smashed a house and a trolleybus at Kurenivka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential mass on the Vinegar, from which one person died, another 19 people were injured, including four children.
On 21 March, Russian rocket launchers destroyed the modern Retroville rocket in Vinegar, killing at least 4 people.
The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, once again said on April 13 that the residents of the capital, who had evacuated from the city, would return so far prematurely.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, in the vicinity of the capital there are many mines and unexploded ammunition.
The main intelligence department of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning the first series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation, in order to accuse Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army with regard to the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil base exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgorod stated that near the city allegedly dropped a "Ukrainian shell".
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing in the cold sweat of the very idea that NATO fighters will be beaten by Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky doesn’t talk so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to none of his predecessors.
Zelensky doesn’t convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these speeches, this sophisticated alloy of strength, agitation and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against the closure of the sky, 70% of its fellow citizens already support this idea.
While Paris or Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine’s accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be seen as scammers.
The money you will collect is better given to people who need it more.

There's hope... it's not all for long.
Now....agree...something will happen.
The brain refuses to perceive...
Where to go ?? I have no one and nowhere.
I've got <0x24>50 in my pocket.
Many of our employees were not paid a salary for their jobs.
Where do I go ?? Who do I need ? How do I provide for my children ? Where do I live ?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't really take anything out of the house... to drive 1,000 miles.
You don’t know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you draw children all over Prague.
What's next? I don't know. How much? I don't know. Kids ask for sweets. And you can't. It's expensive to you.

We have a choice - to stay there and invoke children in danger, or to try to save yourself here

These were tankers who stood on the Zhytomyr track in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These utilities, which carry garbage, repair pipelines and power lines under the siege, provide people with the necessary.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, without complaining about anything, but volunteer at the free minute, collecting pharmacists on the front.

I am looking for accommodation for me and my daughter for 3-4 days every day to arrive in the Czech Republic and passports to issue a visa to Canada.

Therefore, I decided to search for accommodation in Prague or near it.
No, we're all set.

Very tasty apples, what kind of variety is this?
The head of the Office of President Andriy Yermak said that Russia is starting a “fake operation” on weapons that the allies are handing over to us.
Yermak’s direct speech: “They understand that they are losing the war, seeing their reluctance and striving to “break” the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last fakes is the destruction of the S-300 SSR transmitted by Slovakia.
This information has already been rejected by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scripts of the Russians. I will name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers surrender with weapons from allies, and it is massively switching to the weapons of the Russian army.
I want to warn those fakes right away.
Because the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the U.S. Army sends the enemy exclusively to the world.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after the emergence of evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these messages as a “provocation”.
“Reports of the killed, raped and severely wounded by Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians are worth the sentence,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jassin Ardern told reporters in Wellington 4.
“Russia must be held accountable to the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called the incidents "a violation of international law".
The statements were made after the emergence of reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into brother tombs or left in the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation.
Photos depicting the bodies of civilians executed with their hands tied shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the culprits.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian troops have committed “war crimes” in Bucharest.
“What happened in Bucharest requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be directed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit a “genocide” in Bucha.
“We will do everything we can to ensure that those who committed these war crimes are not unpunished,” Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova rejected the accusation as a "provocation".
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had “ordered” images to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who ‘ordered’ this story,” Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry had also said, without evidence, that the image of Bucha was "another image of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucharest.
The follow-up committee of Russia on April 4 published a statement in which it declared an “investigation” on charges of spreading “consciously false information” to Ukraine about the actions of Russian troops in Bucharest.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing “genocide” in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucharest to see what their military had done.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being executed,” Zelensky said in the videoconference, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for the shootings in the basement," he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with tied hands behind our backs and decapitated, I don’t understand,” he said of the scenes of the victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, the city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
A correspondent of the Ukrainian service Radio Svoboda on April 2 saw bodies of like civilians on the streets of a small city.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in different places in Bucharest.
The bodies of one of nine people – all civilians – were scattered on the ground near the site, which, according to local residents, was used by Russian forces as a base.
It looks like the victims were killed from a distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the Kyiv area, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you so much, I bought everything on the list.
"They were told: Kiev is no." As the occupants of the floor exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
There is another point in this list, about which there is currently much less information – the expulsion of the local population to enemy territory.
Around mid-March, Russian occupiers have "evacuated" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually handed over to the Russian military police.
“Ukrainian Truth” has searched for expulsed Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the “evacuation” itself is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to voluntary and forced evacuation outside the borders of Ukraine under psychological pressure and from nowhere.
Fortunately, they are still alive and in contact with their families.
However, in view of the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were deported to Russia and Belarus under harsh coercion.
Thus, in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second birthplace, took away children without parents, among them 12-year-old Miroslav, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine from swimming Yosip Zachevinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander was given a job at Antonov airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled in the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As real plastics, Dennis and Marina had already collected alarming baggage, but on the morning of February 24th, they were unable to evacuate.
They did not have their car, and the suburban buses no longer took anyone.
At about 12 a.m. on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first missiles arrived.
One of them went into the neighboring house.
The family then went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
“At 6 p.m. on February 24, people who spoke neither Russian, nor Ukrainian entered the congress.
They ask, “Who is there?” – I say, “Come out!”
They searched for me, asked who was in the basement if there was a gun.
All the men were asked if they were serving in the army.
They said to the women, "We have come to protect you by the direction of Ramzan Kadirov."
It was a Chechen OMON, not even a military, young boys aged 25-35.
They said: "We were helped by the Ukrainians in the war, Sashko Bilyi (commanded by the Nationalist Movement of UNA-Unsso Viking, who fought on the Chechen side in the first Russian-Czech War – UP), now we are helping you to fight."
On the third day, they asked me what was missing.
We say that water was a big problem with it.
They broke the shop, took the goods from there under the slogan "all the same Russian pickups" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also an online video where children thank Kadirov for the food.
So, after the robbery, they brought a cowboy and said, "We understand that's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to talk about it, but they did a nice cut.
Our child there says, “You have 7 days to give our phones back” – they laughed.
They are constantly separating themselves from the Russians.
They said how good they came, because they didn’t want the war, the Ukrainians support and are generally good: “Putin is a coward, Kadirov too, but we can’t do anything, because there are our families there.”
And basically they didn't fight, they drove to rob shops, they moored.
The chicken was brought, one tied to one leg with the Georgiyev ribbon, and to the other - his white scotch and called it "military".
They arrived in Ukraine without any preparation at all.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten in the Bush, so they didn't even take the dead, they asked us, "What do you have, artillery?"
What’s more, we were standing in the corners – the Chechens didn’t know each other, in the first days asked for passwords to find out, theirs or strangers.
They were with us until March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, and after them – the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 units of equipment between the houses – ours constantly fell into it from the "Byraktars".
But these came and told us that the U.S. Army no longer exists, but there is "Azov", and, according to their words, "Azov" about 100 thousand in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been advancing since the beginning of March.
One day, a Russian – either a landing officer or a representative of the FSB – came to us and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio – there was about Buchu, Gostomel, we thought, maybe also gave us a "green corridor".
From the very beginning we passed our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they say, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don’t want either there or there.
They answered, “So sorry for the psyche of your children!”
How it worked: they drove us to the basement and started shooting from under the house – either “Cities” or miniatures.
And then it flew back... neighboring houses just burned, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct involvement in our house on the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to pass us on to the borders and the Red Cross.
Part did not go, saying that it was for the traitors of the homeland – said, “you are shot there, the organs will be sold.”
We were driven through Chernobyl, there were burners on both sides of the road, broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians were immediately exporting equipment to them.
A lot of captains, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian passport point "Komar" we underwent an improvised inspection, many were without documents at all, because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear shots! Shoots a rocket, and it is apparent that it was working "Iskander" in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said, “No, these planes are flying, they are deploying at the border.”
But we're from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were immersed in the bus and taken to the Chonka sanatorium near Gomel.
His leader, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, came and said, "Here I am, I am from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these your thieves are caught.
The poor people are suffering!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
As he says, it will be.”
They offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us, "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the United Nations (at least so they were called) spread disinformation that men cannot go to Poland.
A lot of people believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents – the daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to get it on Monday, and the war started on Thursday.
In the Ukrainian consulate we were not helped at all, but in Minsk at the station, we were told that without passports no one would take the bus.
I would like to say that we have been very helpful by the Belarusian volunteers.
We were also settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
There was no force in the sanatorium.
Our second group migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier, who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Walking near Moziry (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – UP), we saw ballistic missile launches across Ukraine: the missile first flies, beautifully glows, and then goes off.
The people who were on the bus in Mozir, told that the Russians there were constantly shooting from the polygons.
But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
The generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, does not believe at all.
They say, “We are a people of peace.”
They do not realize that their polygons are used for the shootings of Ukraine.
There were friends waiting in Poland who took us to Estonia.
Now we are going through registration, deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, the Ukrainian flags are now, of course, as much as the Estonian flags.”
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with the family of her brother – his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to the basement of the neighbor’s house.
Marina herself was unable to return home and in principle will not be able – the house no longer exists.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.
Is there a place in the center on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything and we are always waiting for you!
Thank you for the arrangement, the motifs are nice
And in this small apartment does not catch wifi, mostly all your questions I answer and now I don't know how to be?And in children from Monday classes online, and there is no internet.

On April 1st, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced the joyous news that the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were expelled from all of the Kyiv region.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians should feel at this moment was obscured by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in only one Bucha the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were just killed on the street, some were tied up and shot in the basement, some of the killed were minors.
Murdered and tortured, the oldest of the village of Motijan, Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, were found kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the brother’s grave, Igor was in the sewer.
The bodies of several disguised women, wrapped in a blanket, were found on the side of the tracks 20 km from Kiev.
The Russians tried to burn them.
If I go home, there will be no one.
I ordered a parcel from Germany with DHL.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said about this in an interview with the Associated Press, whose sketches were published by the President's Office, writes "European Truth".
"All the equipment, everything they're already sending, for some types of equipment it's done late.
So what if, for example, we talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, that’s true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes,” Zelensky said.
Asked about this, Ukraine received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied, "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not exist, or it would have a different form.
“It would have been different, we would have shoulders of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I’m sure there would still be no war,” he added.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised new military assistance to Ukraine, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and I'm going home.

“I tell her that ‘the repair of the TV and radio receiver’ has been delayed due to import details, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to be overcrowded when calling.”
“We’ve been hiding infs about war for a month.
So far it works.
However, in the spots (the cat – UP) on the pus and the back of the legs, the scalp is covered with fur – it can be from stress, changes in the diet and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The spot, unlike the beetle, is not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga hears badly and spends most of the time in her room, her bride lived in an apartment with her "incognito".
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days, as a guerrilla, I lived with her in the apartment.
The war was also hidden from her, and the fact that I was nearby — formally came for a few hours as always.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her a receiver – she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.”
The radio was always on the side of the bed.
She spends most of her time in her room.
He heard badly – it allowed me to be invisible to her.
When I heard the sound of her “walking,” I hid in my room.
First of all, she hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then I called everyone who was communicating with her. It's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but the war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It's April 17th - I have 2 apartments clean :)

The British, who defended Mariupol in the U.S. Army, says they are ready to surrender in captivity to the Russians
The British, who is a military officer of the naval infantry brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who is involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would build weapons and surrender in captivity to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Aiden Eislin, a British woman who has served in the U.S. Army since 2018, Air Force with a reference to family members and friends of Eislin, Atlas News with a reference to the words of his friend Eislin who spoke to him.
We received a message from him: “It’s been 48 days, we’ve tried everything we can to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender in captivity to Russian troops.
We don’t have enough food and ammunition.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will soon end.”
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces, which participates in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
Air Force journalists contacted the mother of a military officer, Anne Wood, and she confirmed that her son had said on the phone that they were planning to appear captive.
Army friend Brennan Phillips also confirmed to reporters that in the last phone call, Eislin told about plans for their capitulation unit.
According to him, the brigade ended with ammunition and food.
Journalists at Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that the Eisenhower unit intends to surrender to the Russian units in order not to get without weapons and bullets into the hands of the so-called "squadroners".
Also on social networks were broadcast audio recordings of a telephone conversation, on which allegedly Aceslin talks with his acquaintance American friend, who is planning to go to Ukraine.
In an interview, Eislin said that they were trying to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Vagner.
He was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the CSU and sworn in.
Ashlyn's friends and relatives called him Johnny, and on social media he was better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

Attackers for their losses in the battle played in full.
They shot the teacher Dmitry Pavlytsky, his unnamed relative, the young Boris Oleksienko.
Their bodies were thrown into “a deep well of laundry that was dug in the ground.”
There was a “dead silence” in the city.
Rarely, some of the residents ran from house to house.
In the streets, the bodies of the Bolsheviks were always met.
And I, maybe, I'm really going after you. I need you. I can't without you.

I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because that was the last hope, right?
I am not afraid of work, as I also lived in the village, so I can and love to work physically.
When you can bring things
You have a very interesting tradition, we go to Christmas like this
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada passed draft law 7176, which is entitled "On the monitoring of potential threats to the national security of Ukraine in the sphere of the economy".
It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine’s national security in the sphere of the economy was... the place for the meetings of the members of the supervisory board of state companies and state banks.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decision-making by the supervisory board of the state company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state companies, but we do not yet know about any company that has had a need to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is understandable – it is a great basis for “putting down” all the gains in the heavy reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Competence, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual management.
Which was until 2015.
Why do state companies have supervisory boards and who should join them?
What’s more, if under the patriotic slopes one harmful bill “flights”, then tomorrow others can fly – for example, the system of state procurement can be abolished through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
There are many things that can be written for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and Bill 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this norm was added to the comparative table of Bill 5397.
And in general, the desire to dismantle the supervisory board in one way or another has been circulating among some popular voters for a long time.
Not for criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will understand the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will make our proposals on how to solve the issues of governance of state enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such an innovation with the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make remote work of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the work of the company may be paralysed.
We agree that such a risk exists, but will it be able to prevent the transfer of the members of the supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (which make up the majority of the whole) will provide their personal safety above the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be released.
And then, most likely, it will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, as the law provides for the need to conduct a competitive selection, which lasts on average 3-4 months.
Therefore, the proposed draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to save from the loss of the ability of the Supervisory Board to make a decision, but rather will lead to this!
The People's Deputy, the author of the bill Dmitry Nataluha provides other arguments for his support.
In particular, he noted: “Many enterprises, in particular the Defence Industrial Complex (DEI), now need relocations” and therefore “it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna through Zoom.”
For starters, in Ukraine, there are almost no state-owned OPK companies that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in "Ukroboronprom", which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of OPK.
But even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties not on a free basis.
The entire power of the Ukroboronrom belongs to the Director General, who, by the way, will take a decision on the need to relocate one or the other company of the OPC, which is part of the group.
In addition, such an argument does not endure criticism even because draft law 7176 does not in any way make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of OPC.
Mr. Dmitry Dmitry on his Facebook page also lists arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with the improvement of the efficiency of the work of state companies and state banks, but let's try to figure out some of them: "respectful experts-foreigners in the first word "war", Ukraine's war, Ukraine's war is still in 2021.
First, this is manipulation – most of such supervisory board members have never lived in Ukraine and have only come here periodically.
Therefore, to say that they are “leaving Ukraine,” softly speaking, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory council have long relied on the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in global practice, and in absolutely different fields: business, education, medicine, etc.
It should also be noted that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have a different job, and it is the electronic means of communication that help them in this.
Third, all of these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitry not make identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not in the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from oversight councils, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.

In the Brovarsk, Vyshgorod and Buchanan districts of the Kyiv region, which have been liberated from the occupiers, will introduce a reinforced commanding hour for 2 days.
In the settlements of Brovarsk, Vyshgorod and Bukhansk districts, which were under Russian occupation and were released by the Ukrainian defence forces, the commanding hour was strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and border forces will operate from 21:00 on April 2 to 6:00 on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the district, at this time it is categorically forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go out on the street during an alarm to go into hiding.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression – to clean up and diversify the territories.
Omelyanuk called on people who had left these areas to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the territory of Kyiv, the commanding hour will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

The Serbian defense budget has increased in geometric progression for several years in a row.
Over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion in the modernization of the military, the upgrade of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places on the list of the world’s most powerful military powers.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, western countries took quite seriously the prediction of a possible exacerbation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

Lukashenko’s regime detained three Belarusians for 27 and 28 years, who were involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of a signalling facility under Osipovich, which ensures the movement of railways.
Source: "Radio Svaboda", human rights center "Vasna", the head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Interior Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state information agency "Belta"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruysk were detained and one injured, with the support of the SOBR special envoys.
According to the "Fly", during the detention, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs, Gennady Kazakevich, said that "acts of terrorism on the RB railroad will be severely stopped" by the military using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police arrested another employee of the Belarusian railway, the employee of the Baranovic branch "BZD" and the administrator of thematic resources "BZD" in "VKontaktie" and "Odnoklassnikih" Valentina.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, <0x40>belzhd_live reports.
At the end of March, at least 40 railroaders were detained in Belarus for diversion.
Recall: The formation of BYpol, declared by the Lukashenko regime extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out diversions on the facilities of railway transport and infrastructure of Belarus in the framework of the "Peramoga" plan.
The Belarusian “race guerrillas” are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus the Russian Federation is moving to war, in Ukraine live power and technology.
This is to increase self-esteem.
Do you like to read books?
And on the phone they don't work on Easter holidays either?
Is it possible to do this on the phone any day or not?
Even a separate law has been passed on this issue.
We’ve been here for 4 days, it’s just a scary road, not a road.
They went through the Kyiv region, the city of Irpin, then there were horrors, shots, sirens.
I'm worried about them too.
Sylvia, Mashi from Kletsani hasn't got the money yet, can I call them?
Yeah, I'll tell them, I think they'll be home.
There are different Muslims. There are fanatics, and there are really believers.
The meaning of jihad is treated differently by different Muslims.
But honestly, it’s very uncomfortable for me to do it for money.
You did a lot of good to me.
I can do it for free.
Temporary for a period while we are looking for a university, then of course you will need a permanent residence
but maybe there will be a hostel in it. (we are looking for Prague, Brno, and other places)
We are now a week away from Prague, we have a car, we are willing to pay partially for the accommodation.
The city or village does not matter, it is desirable that it be a separate accommodation.
I hit something in the water bottle and connected two unnecessary shares for which the funds were withdrawn and I can't turn them off <0xF0><0x9F><0x98><0xAD>
And then he took the money out of the card, which was not on it.
And I don't understand why the money was withdrawn.

On Tuesday, be at home and wait for the master repairers.

Can we change the mobile fare if you have time? Is it too late?
U.S. bans investment in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin’s daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, are imposing new sanctions against President Putin’s daughters, the largest banks of the Russian Federation, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is reported on the White House’s website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, which is owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets pertaining to the U.S. financial system and ban U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
“This move is based on the decision of more than 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The exit of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law firms and consulting firms,” the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States was restrictions on large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from conducting transactions with these organizations and freeze any of their assets under the jurisdiction of the United States.
A detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be announced the following day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of the adult children of Putin, the wife and daughter of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Lavrov, as well as members of the Security Council of Russia, including the ex-President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and the Prime Minister.
Sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, the next ride is closed and I will approach you
Vera, can we wash the dishes in the car?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a board manager for SkyApp, my mother was a sweeper of industrial products, the daughter of Makarchik was a gardener.
We lived beautifully, and we didn’t even think that we would be forced to run, because there is no longer any strength to hide in the grave.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we hope that for the first time someone will welcome us) We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but if it will be in our pockets.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We don’t have bad habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time for us.
After lunch, I had one lesson in English and then went to work in the children’s room.
I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands everything and does everything well.
And I also met Mrs. Lena and talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the pool.

I dreamed of being a teacher.
My girls can't move anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.

Tomorrow I hear, the Internet is not working well. Overnight
You're lucky what you're going to do
Thanks .. found something with the things, but there was nothing from the tech...
Both beginners, except for the alphabet, know nothing.
There's nothing going on.

We'll do it sometime.
But how it will be paid, please, no loans.
Write to me directly, and I will help.
We are your partner, or I am not your partner.
I don't know.
Do you have to take the clothes you gave?

Something has come from you, I can't see what
I am very sad too.
I'll remind you of the bill later.
Do you have only Dad speaking and understanding the Russian language?
On what day does a colleague want to do the cleaning of the house and how many houses have windows?
I am ashamed to distract you from your work.
Good evening, I can't fail to share with you. There is a message from Mariupol for the son - alive and in good condition.
I'd like to honor Joe Dispenso, he's scientifically conducting research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections.
The journalist of the TV channel "1<0x2B>1" Natalia Nagorna released a video on the morning of April 12, which she was transmitted to the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they have no weapons left to participate in the battles, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said, “The bill goes on for hours.”
Earlier, on April 11, the 36th separate naval infantry brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command had not been in contact with the fighters for two weeks.
The social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the link between the command and the defence forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of a public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletsky reported, the Russian army applied chemical weapons over the "Azovstal" plant, which is held by the fighters of the "Azov" regiment.
Thank you, I will arrange for you. It would be very good
The situation is the same, while we remain here
2 hours drive )) walks, mom shops and back)!
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what to do here.
The squadron of Czech drones from today started flying over Ukraine <0xF0><0x9F><0x87><0xA8><0xF0><0x9F><0x87><0xA6>.
Nearly 50 professional helicopters will be used to detect, and some of them - to directly destroy the enemy invader <0xF0><0x9F><0x92><0xA5>.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech “bird” brothers were sent to Ukraine yesterday thanks to the deputy of Mukachevskaya municipality Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, because their inter-Hungarian friends led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/example101/ Vasil Shhour delivered drones on the assignment: they were received by the three special units of Ukrainian troops.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of computers - the locations of their deployment will now be kept secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, say: in the coming days, they will send many more interesting "gifts" to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier.
I don't care, it's okay. I love sweet, but I can and without it
I'm worried we won't be able to.
I’ll be back in Ukraine soon, keep working.
Okay, if it's okay, I'll agree.
I'll try it myself, but if there's any problems I'll write you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other.
We were personally at the old lady in the village of Job, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing
Maybe she'll betray and her mood will rise.
I got my phone repaired today.
I think I’m still frozen on the street today.
I have taken medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry, too, but I'd better meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, give me the music you like.
I wonder what kind of music you have. <0xF0><0x9F><0x98><0x8A>
Mom and Dad need to listen.
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's carriage.
Today it was cooler and raining here. Tomorrow it should be warm.
But no harm to the destroyed houses, no harm to the people over whom the occupiers are oppressed
In Kherson, the occupants attended the memorial "The Glory of Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopsky Street.
Details: It is noted that the unknown have blown up the flag of the European Union, crushed panels with pictures of the Celestial Hundred and killed in the Russian-Ukrainian War.
The occupiers exploded portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russo-Ukrainian War.
Take the flag.
Good morning, thank you to the children for the Christmas, we don't have such a habit so we didn't know, gave the children only chocolate and cake, maybe something else needed to be given
In Czech, there is someone to talk to, if anything.
'Cause I live in a cottage for twelve people here, and then they go to work.
Hello, it's a little better.
He was in the hallways today.
I’ve slept there even today.
That is why we have made great progress.
I'll definitely bring the bunnies another time!
I don’t have the strength to do it today.
Since I am pushed back from the days and times when there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can say about April a month because I already have an approximate schedule of cleaning apartments.
For the month of May - I can say about the end of April or the beginning of May.
I just asked if you have anything to say about it.
Hello, sorry for not writing for a long time cooked dinner and slept a bit
If you don’t mind, can I come today?
We’ll see you soon after you arrive.)
He's been modest, he's been learning a lot lately. He realized that he really needs it in life
Hi, everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson from the lady who is the director of the department of economy of the region of height.
She was very happy with my work.
I've behaved very well in my boots.
On Monday I have to bring confirmation of employment as well as cash payment for the jaws.

If you go to the doctor tomorrow, I’ll go with you if you can.
I need to get another analysis.
You won’t have to go again.
It works very badly, it washes badly. You need a master. You need to set up.
That's all there is.
Can you send me the correct e-mail address?
I would like to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you have registered for.
Are children being fed there or should they be brought with them?
And now for a minute you can come to me there is one question
If you still need help write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn’t really want you to raise money from the beginning, so people wouldn’t think we were speculating on this!
But for online filling, I didn’t have enough two points:
I will lie down to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Selection

The University of Caracas urges employees and students to carefully check any information, not to rely on anonymous sources in messenger and social networks, rumors and tiles.

So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, also helps the army
I picked up a few jobs for the portfolio.
After the holidays, you have to have the internet.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How I record a day that I had not been at work is a pass
Headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Pridnestrov region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighboring state".
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation conduct provocative actions in the territory of the Pridnestrov region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues the creation of an offensive group of troops for action in the direction of Slobozhan.
Probably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to carry out the preparation and dispatch of personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in combat operations on the territory of Ukraine.
The preparation of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th separate motorshooter brigade (Monastery) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military District.
Probably, the said weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also for the restoration of the loss of the personnel of the units of the battalion tactical group of the 36th separate motor-shooter brigade (Borja, Zabaykalsk region) 29 of the general army of the Eastern Armistice Military District.
A special problem is felt by the enemy when assembling the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The completion of the selected staff from the point of permanent deployment is planned for the second half of April this year.
Probably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the delivery of cargo to the places of conducting combat operations, will continue attacks on transport infrastructure facilities in the territory of Ukraine with the aim of destroying or decommissioning them.
Determined units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the direction of Slobozhan, separate units of the 6th general army and coastal forces of the northern fleet continue partial blockade of the city of Kharkov, continued artillery shelling of separate areas of the city.
Air reconnaissance of the area continues in the direction of Izumi with the aim of identifying the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 BPL.
Forces to two battalion tactical groups of the enemy attempted to carry out an offensive in the direction of the settlements of Dovgenyk and Dmitryvk, was unsuccessful and retreated to the previously occupied positions.
In the direction of Donetsk, the enemy’s main efforts continue to focus on the takeover under control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubi<0xC5><0xBE>ne, Nizhny Novgorod and Novobakhmuthivka, as well as the establishment of full control of the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out raids in the Golden area, was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupants continue the assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
The forces of the individual units of the enemy carried out artillery shelling positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Visokopilla, Trudolyubivka and Maryansky.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine carried out four enemy attacks last day, destroyed five tanks, eight units of armored equipment, six units of automotive equipment and eight enemy artillery systems.
Don't you understand your thoughts?
We will try to do it, but I doubt it.
And how can you sleep if you want and I'm late for you
Are you sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, then tell me I'll understand)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home and more than 1<0x2B>1. We do not need to adjust :)
I turn on the TV here exclusively in order to listen to the Czech language
Today I have a month-to-month package :)
Can we do this today on the phone?
Buy embroidery fabric, canvas, embroidery yarn
I understand, so I can prepare the material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she's giving us so much cake.
We'll meet my dad later, definitely <0xF0><0x9F><0x99><0x8F><0xF0><0x9F><0x8F><0xBB>
I read an ad on Facebook , that maybe Google wrote something on its own <0xF0><0x9F><0x8F><0xB5><0xEF><0xB8><0x8F>. , I think the phone number is enough
Good morning, we brought the things you brought, but there are things that we can bring small things in 10 minutes?
I've been thinking about work.
If the Director agrees, then I can start to work next week because tomorrow before noon I plan to go to the workplace to submit documents (if you can, because very large queues) and on Saturday it rains :)
I'm looking for a brigade at the beginning, I liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream of working on Tiva
Friends long and not very long, friends I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
You have also had a difficult time.
Over the past month, I have been communicating with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy before, has been turned from foot to head, as is the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilt and shame because of the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
Because of the fact that they submit to Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you, activists, have long been threatened, and you have been preparing for a decisive strike.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my longtime friend from the Memorial.
Let's tell you a little later, - as usual, Sasha laconically replied. - Now, after the search, we go through the ruins.
Others – active cultures, artists, critics, writers – are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let’s be honest: except for very few of you – those who worked at the Memorial, in the New Newspaper, in the Echo Moscow, in the Medusa, in the Navalny organization and in a number of other places – would many of you have done something for someone else?
Except that they participated in the protests when they were still taking place.
Also read the column of the Russian journalist "Too late to hide, too late to silence"
And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-lasting indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive sympathy, which now probably put a great burden on your soul and heart?
That wasn't always the case.
In the 1990s there was a short period when you had to a certain extent freedom and democracy—unorganized even bloody, but real.
But the year 1991 turned out to be no better than the year 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you are finally embraced by such a strong fear of sadness that you are looking for salvation behind the king, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, it seems to you that he's safer.
Actually, mistakes have been made.
Instead of capturing and disclosing the KGB archives, as the Germans did from the stash, you took your soul to the Dzerzhinsky monument – and allowed the KGB to lie down, renew, transform and take power over the country.
When you were placed before the choice between the theft of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not begin to fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly agreed with the theft.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass gatherings for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was the survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started to level Chechnya with the ground again, most of you looked at it.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation,” and with my own eyes I saw the ruins of the Horrible, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on the weekends I returned to Moscow and had a fun trip with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors that I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murder of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me, "Breed, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
I replied, "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your fucking country, not mine.
I'm just a stupid stranger here.
It’s your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.”
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn’t want to know anything.
Then came an economic rise in the middle of zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that part of the stolen money will remain in middle-class pockets.
Many of you have become well-earned, some are wealthy, and even the poorest of you have bought a new home and found the best job.
Prices are rising, isn't that a bad thing?
Moscow was shiny and shiny.
When several opponents were killed – Yuri Shekkochyin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others – many of you were shocked and expressed fear about what happened.
However, the case did not go on.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President Medvedev and himself took the place of prime minister, you, I see, barely paid attention to this.
When, after a few months of Medvedev’s rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored or silenced it.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the hills of Kazbegi or in the cafés and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West have done a lot, if at all we have done something.
A little bit of anger, a little bit of sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia is cripplingly violating international law when such a great temptation of Russia’s oil, gas and domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the heavy 1990s, it was the most important thing.
At the end of 2011, however, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again exchanged places with Medvedev and planted a chair as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went to mass protests.
Navalny’s name became famous, you didn’t walk out of the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt horribly losing ground under its feet.
Then he gave a blow in response.
Initially, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands of people were behind bars.
Some people have had a lot of time.
"What could we have done?"
I’ve heard it so often and I still hear it.
“The country is so strong and we are so weak.”
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by the pro-Russian president, who scammed their European hopes, they once seized Maidan – and never left him.
They built a tent town entirely on their own and were preparing for a decisive defense.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy him, they began to defend themselves with sticks, armor and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protesters went into the attack.
A lot of people died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and the Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose leaders on their own and expel them if they do their business badly.
Maidan did not like Putin very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the common misfortunes, he captured Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there is little benefit to it.
How many of you have been fascinated!
As far as I know, 91% of the citizens of Russia supported the annexation.
Suddenly a new myth was born from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his sheikh suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It’s hard for me to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
“We don’t care about politics,” you said.
And you’re newly hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, go as new after the restoration started by the mayors of Moscow in 2012 – with their binge boxes, public wifi and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and it only gets better.
You have just turned your attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
Even the Moscow editor, who published my book about Syria, criticized it in an interview at the time because I didn’t understand what was going on in Syria at all.
Well, at least, I went there and I saw on the streets of Homs state snipers shooting cold-blooded at my kids' peers.
Of all the citizens of Russia, there were only your soldiers, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemmeler:
“First they came for the socialists, but I was silent – because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for trade union members, but I was silent – because I am not a trade union member.
Then they came to the Jews, but I kept silence, for I am not a Jew.
Then they came after me, but there was no one left who could say anything for my protection.”
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did it.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some really speak now – like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsannikov, risking to get into the new GULAG or to form a company for Navalny.
As far as others are concerned, you know best in which country you live.
Therefore, I am sure you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians – or, which seems very likely, if he does not succeed, he will take for you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who are brave, but mostly alone, went out to protest and still took place for a minor term, but will soon get more serious.
For a thousand of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement on social networks (even if only a black square in Instagram) or expressed in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of detention were given just for an anecdote, remained not so far in the past – and now they are most likely waiting for you in the future.
Then who's going to speak for you?
The example of Ukrainians – even more than 2014 – frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing his preference might be on the paper.
In view of everything, few in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You are reading foreign news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you are in contact.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just hohhma, your laws, if you don't take into account the repressive, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media no more, your economy is ruined by the squirrels more than I write, you have no more than the squirrels.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.
And if you don’t give him what he wants, you can either try to go, or you’ll be spoiled.
I doubt you'll see another option.
And yet there is one more.
Which, in the end, will bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the conditions that have formed, you will need less of what you think.
Think about it.
Iskra will not explode from you: due to the economic collapse that is raging on Russia, it is most likely to burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices go down and wages don’t pay, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go out to the streets.
Putin knows this and is afraid of these people much more than he is afraid of the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to meetings on its own, as it has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be transformed into a mass.
You have this great magic tool – the internet, which the mode can limit, but which is still working and which can be set up in almost any circumstance.
Navalny's organization has been broken, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized.
A lot of you, millions.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly with hundreds of thousands.
If there are more than 300,000, it will be stunned.
We will have to use an army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After all, what did he force them in Ukraine, all that, why did he force them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel a comprehensible fear; those who have children will be afraid for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid if I were you, too.
On the example of Syria, and now of Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what is happening to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only demand freedom, but really try to acquire it.
But even if you don’t do anything, many people’s lives will still be lost in vain.
Your son will leave a joke in a computer game chat – and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet – and will be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes – and die in a Syrian camera under the cops.
This is what has been going on for many years – and will only continue to grow, gaining more and more scale.
So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know what's going to end.
Act cold-blooded, think strategically, and make it a reality.
